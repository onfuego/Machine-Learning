 Man, what the fuck you talking about man?

 Your concurrence in the above is assumed 
 Top secret ultra random message

 Why don't you tell him about the time we faced DOOM? 
 (All right, well as I remember 
 DOOM had threatened the world leaders with the destruction of every major city on Earth 
 Headquarters 
 (Good evening) 
 Would you believe it? It's DOOM on the phone 
 Mark my words well 
 I have plotted my revenge on DOOM 
 Now I shall have it 
 DOOM hates his us all

 Crowd around! 
 I used to cop a lot 
 But never copped no drop 
 Hold mics like pony tails, tight, and bob alot 
 Stop and stick around 
 Come through and dig the sound 
 Of the fly brown six-o sicko psycho who throws his dick around 
 Bound to go three-plat 
 Came to destroy rap 
 It's a intricate plot of a b-boy strat 
 [PEM Stack or vmstat], cats get kidnapped 
 Then release a statement to the press - let the rest know who did that 
 Metal Face terrorists claim responsibility 
 Broken household name usually said in hostility 
 Um... what... it's MF, you silly 
 I'd like to take ""Mens to the End"" for two milli' 
 ""Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!"" That's a audio daily double 
 Rappers need to fall off just to save me the trouble, yo 
 Watch your own back 
 Can't even go out alone, black 
 Stay in the zone - turn H2O to Cognac

 Ever since the womb till I'm back where my brother went

 Right above my government, Dumile [Doom's real name is Daniel Dumile] 
 Either unmarked or engraved, hey, who's to say? 
 I wrote this one in B.C. D.C. O-section 
 If you don't believe me, go get bagged and check then 
 Cell number 17, up under the top bunk 
 I say this not to be mean, wish bad luck or pop junk 
 Pop the trunk on See-Cipher-Punk, leave him left scraped

 Definition ""super-villain"": a killer who love children 
 One who is well-skilled in destruction, as well as building 
 While Sidney Sheldon teaches the trife to be trifer 
 I'm trading science fiction with my man the live lifer 
 A pied piper holler a rhyme, a dollar and a dime 
 Do his thing, ring around the white collar crime 
 Get out my face, askin' 'bout my case, need toothpaste 
 Fresher mint, monkey-style nigga get [Denta-Dent] 
 And dope fiends still in they teens, shook niggas turn witness 
 Real mens mind their own business 
 That's the difference between sissy-pissy rappers that's double-dutch

 I'll tell y'all fools it's hella cool how ladies from Cali talk 
 Never let her interfere with the Yeti ghetto slang 
 Nicknames [? off nipple and tip of nipples?].metal fang 
 Known amongst hoes for the bang-bang 
 Known amongst foes for flow without no talking orangutan 
 Only gin and Tang 
 Guzzled out a rusty tin can 
 Me and this mic is like yin and yang 
 Clang! Crime don't pay, listen, youth 
 It's like me holding up the line at the kissing booth 
 I took her back to the truck, she was uncouth 
 Spittin' all out the sunroof, through her missing tooth 
 But then she has a sexy voice, sound like Jazzy Joyce 
 So I turned it up faster than a speeding knife 
 Strong enough to please a wife 
 Able to drop today's math in the 48 keys of life 
 Cut the crap far as rap 
 Touch the mic, get the same thing a Arab will do to you for stealing 
 What the devil? He's on another level

 In his right hand was your man's worst nightmare 
 Loud enough to burst his right eardrum close-range 
 The game is not only dangerous, but it's most strange 
 I sell rhymes like dimes 
 The one who mostly keep cash but brag about the broker times 
 Joker rhymes, like the ""Is you just happy to see me?"" trick 
 Classical slap-stick rappers need Chapstick 
 A lot of 'em sound like they in a talent show 
 So I give 'em something to remember, like the Alamo 
 Tally-ho! A high Joker like Spades game 
 Came back from five year layin' and stayed the same 
 Sayin' - electromagnetic feeling blocks all logic, Spock 
 And G- shocks her biological clock 
 When I hit it, slit her to the shitter, thought I killed her goose 
 Her Power-Use was pure Brita water, filtered juice 
 Keep a pen like a fiend keep a pipe wit' 'im 
 Gentleman who lent a pen to a friend who write wit' 'im 
 Never seen the shit again, but he's still my dunny 
 Only thing that come between us is krill and money 
 I sell rhymes like dimes

 Better rhymes make for better songs, it matters not 
 If you got a lot of what it takes just to get along 
 Surrender now or suffer serious setbacks 
 Got get-back, connects wet-back, get stacks 
 Even if you gots to get jet-black, head to toe 
 To get the dough, battle for bottles of Mo' or 'dro 
 This rhyme flow take practice like Tae Bo 
 With Billy Blanks 
 Oh, you're too kind! Really, thanks. 
 To the gone and lost forever like ""Oh My Darling Clementine"" 
 He hold his heart when he tellin' rhymes 
 When it's his time, I hope his soul go to Heaven 
 He's nasty like the old time Old Number Seven 
 You still taste it when you chase it with the Coca-Cola 
 Make you wish they coulda erased out the Motorola 
 I told her - no credit for it back 
 If you want what they got, then go get it, it's all gak 
 Only in America could you find a way to make a healthy buck 
 And still keep your attitude on self-destruct

 The, the finest 
 MF DOOM and Mary Davis: 
 As the life cycle goes on, goes on 
 And you learn to hold on, hold on 
 To things like the mic, the mic 
 And you learn to appreciate who is the nicest on said device 
 But who is (The finest)? 
 Tommy Gunn, MF DOOM, and Mary Davis: 
 Time at shashuma, too much drama, blind behind the rumor 
 Time and time and time, my mind, I'm trying to find a tumor 
 Time at shashuma, no time for humor 
 As soon as one of ya' men's dead in Hempstead, you trying to find Pumas 
 Sooner the better, even knitted a sweater already 
 Keep your leather, we coming through the brutal weather 
 We ready to do whatever, yo Doom, you with it? 
 (You know it like a poet, my brother 
 Hey, Gunn you wit it?) Whatever (Finest) 
 Mf doom: 
 I know about going paid to broke, to next day well-off 
 To bust a shell off, to dick-riders, ""Get the hell off"" 
 Made a call to a client, he must've had his cell off 
 A show-off, he has the same bite but fell off 
 I tell off the bat, from science to pure facts 
 Which niggas is wack till they last two tracks 
 Matter fact, y'all could wait for the rep to tell 
 The tall tale, how he escape from out the depths of Hell 
 Tommy Gunn: 
 When die, he gon' die like a soldier die 
 Holding a swollen eye, drinking Olde Gold 
 Smoking a stog, watching popo patrol the beach 
 Blowing my high, rolling by, when Gunn die 
 He gon' try to preach the streets then go to the sky 
 Mf doom: 
 Yup, that hold water, like drizzle in a paper cup 
 This one etched in stone, the chisel with the paper up 
 I need a cut, a taper-up, edge-up 
 Niggas can't measure up, I'm here to get the treasure up 
 Megalon: 
 Stands up and hold 'em high, do or die 
 He got heat, no surprise, stop the beat, close your eyes 
 Got the weed, rolling lah 
 Not sweet, so no demise, all the guys drops seeds so multiply 
 Within the prophecies hold the lie 
 Mf doom: 
 He bled my mother and my father, but can't bleed me 
 OD, ghetto misery 
 He bled my brother, my sister, but can't bleed me 
 A OG, ghetto misery 
 Bled my mother, my father, but can't bleed 
 Me, sci-fly, whole style stuck up 
 Used to talk to myself, I told him, ""Shut the fuck up"" 
 Buckle up 'cause it's about to be rough 
 He said, ""Keep talking that shit, you 'bout to be snuffed"" 
 Then we squashed it, I let 'em know, ""Watch it 
 We only met a time to join these rhymers in the mosh pit"" 
 Gosh, it feels great just to increase the chance 
 For a pussy nigga face to hit the dance floor 
 Megalon and MF DOOM: 
 I pull ya top up, got clout, crack rock, what? 
 Now it's all good business, and so this bitch is locked up 
 On the dance floor. you got knocked out, your bitch got knocked up 
 Baby-face, and hey can you brand you, brand new machete 
 Damn, I just shook your hand and can't stand you already 
 Can't stand you, understand you deadly 
 But my hammer's like a band, my man, it's Brand New and Heavy 
 Yo' Doom, you ready? 
 (Yeah, yo Gunn, you with it?) Whatever 
 Mf doom: 
 Come on stay, I wrote this rhyme on my born-day 
 Remind me of the same style I flipped on ""Hey"" 
 Yikes, who can fuck with the likes 
 Of one such who scores touchdown and spikes mic's 
 Metal grill, with many styles, better still 
 Feel like number twenty-six on a roulette wheel 
 And deal, and run rings around rhymers 
 And run rings like number runners whose old-timers 
 Megalon: 
 Shorty in the all black, she think she all that 
 I called her, she said, ""Don't call back!"" 
 She called me, now what you call that? 
 Let's go back, I sold crack 
 Hold gats, smoke that, drink that, toke that 
 Fuck! Where that ho at? Where that dough at? 
 MF DOOM and Tommy Gunn: 
 Suffering succotash, this hooker broke into his last buck of cash 
 He love her, motherfuck her ass 
 Metal feet dented your car fender 
 My agenda up in the basement party tipping the bartender 
 Is unbeknownst to you, who could get body blown? 
 MF like Mike Fran Corleone 
 And got it sown, maricon, like to know what you staring at? 
 An invisible cat, who pull off a disappearing act 
 Raised by a pack a wild womens like Sweetback 
 Front? I'mma be back (Like brothers in the street act 
 Surrounded by a bunch a bad bitches like Sweetback 
 Fuck with me, I'll be back) 
 Like niggas in the streets act (Streets act)

 Wow, look at that equipment 
 I wonder what DOOM is working on 
 Now I'll just rearrange a few of these circuits 
 Dr. Doom and Mister Fantastic: 
 What are you doing in my room? 
 (You're even more stupid than I thought) 
 Give me those papers 
 (I just came by to say hello 
 But you'd better recheck those equations 
 You're off a few decimals 
 And that means big trouble if you use this material) 
 Get out of here"

 Yo, I'd like to check this microphone before I start right quick 
 Microphone check 2,2,1,2,1,2 
 Big up all the Monsta Island massive 
 And beware before I triple dare you like the last kid 
 Who ask me what we don't got that you got son 
 For one, flow that's elementary my dear Wat-son 
 Secondly, ever since I was little 
 Not so much to riddle, least rhyme to the syllable 
 Keep tracks that make a Arab thief clap 
 With no hands, I chop these drums off 
 Truly yours, G Rap 
 Actual fact, relax 
 In this land of lyrical loss, black 
 I'm not the cool sleet stack 
 The one who might stop and talk to you 
 Poison to few, niggas who be bitin styles I'm like pork to 
 Ooh... what you got to lose? Let mud fly 
 When I got blues I chew whole crews that's bud dry 
 So I ask why the style's from the cess 
 Shit be fuckin' with my eye as I pull it to the chest 
 The super muthafuckin' villain grip the mic wit an iron hand 
 Throwin' emcees to the fire from out da fryin' pan 
 It ain't no use in tryin', man 
 Son, stop cryin 
 Frontin' like you death-defyin' 
 You need to stop lyin' 
 Speak your piece only once you're spoken to first 
 Now lemme hear your verse while I'm chokin' you 
 With bubbly fine rhymes like a editor 
 Throw them to my collection of skulls and spines like Predator 
 Fuck around, the only niggas who could hear the same sound (who?) 
 Was Jet Jaguar and James Brown 
 (Yeah, yeah only them two niggas?) 
 And I'm glad I took the time to write their names down to big 'em up 
 (True, true) 
 I'd like to say hi 
 It's {?} fly the odd Merlin 
 That's quick to whip up a script like Rod Sterling 
 {?} Bad bitch who used to whip the Sterling 
 Who see God ?, never see God earlin' 
 My man Grimm had his little monkey like Space Ghost 
 Me myself I got flavors that out-taste most 
 With numb gums, some rhymers is lake toast 
 Back to you MF Doom, you late show host 
 S to the you to the P E R-uh 
 Who chronicle these times in a 3-D horror 
 {?} Co-star or in a realer drama 
 Who break bread with stingy kin-men, Indian borrower 
 Lone gunmen who candidly flip fly floes 
 Single-handedly with one eye closed 
 In a fly pose, no shirt {?} 
 May see me stack the quarter-mill cash pay 
 That's in a smash way how he did it 
 Muthafucka probably couldn't peep it past a minute"
6,MF Doom,hiphop,"Tick, Tick...","MF DOOM and MF Grimm: 
 (You know when you're gonna come in?) 
 Nobody will never ever, ever, really, really know 
 Because the more you know, the more you know that you don't know shit 
 Niggas'll never run out of shit 
 So much shit, so much scripts through here, niggas never run out of shit 
 (Enjoy the rollercoaster ride) 
 Multifaceted 
 MF Grimm: 
 Walk the path of Jesus, witness if Hell freezes 
 The mind teases reality, crack the pieces 
 Nothing eases; being chastise with blood baptize 
 Guys revise, acknowledge past lives 
 Statements will be made, acknowledge me 
 My mind is Heaven's gate so enter me 
 My mind is the gate to Hell, so try to flee 
 Both gates look the same, which will it be? 
 Demons scream from thought process 
 Enter semen, child born, stress 
 Body want to sleep but the mind can't rest 
 Measure pleasure through financial progress 
 When it come to currency, love is nonexistent 
 Foes multiply, friends become so distant 
 Some hope you die, backstab in an instant 
 Foes I despise, disguised as allies 
 To sabotage, camouflage 
 Loyalty is lies 
 To see God, look into my eyes 
 To see the devil, then you look into my eyes 
 As I rise from Hell's equator 
 'Cause I'mma slow it up, speed it up, slow it up, speed it up 
 Metal Fingers feed beats, Grimm Reaper eat 'em up 
 Speed 'em up, slow 'em up, speed 'em up, slow it up 
 Brainsick, tick, tick, tick, MF blow it up 
 Slow it up, speed it up, slow it up, speed it up 
 Metal Fingers feed beats, Grimm Reaper eat it up 
 Speed it up, slow it up, speed it up, slow it up 
 Brainsick, tick, tick, tick, MF blow it up 
 Take air, compress it, bless it 
 Mix loops like Ku Klux 
 MF don't give two fucks 
 Nigga, quarterback blitz, popped, quickly fumble 
 Leave game with concussion, seeing stars and mumbles 
 This happens to any emcee that wants to rumble 
 Dynasties destroyed like Carringtons and Colbys 
 Noise, reduced, MF thinks in Dolby 
 Chop that ass in half like Obi-Wan Kenobi 
 Greatest of all time, God straight up told me 
 Greatest of all time, the devil even told me 
 Icicles on surfaces of sun, we livin' coldly 
 Prophets be phony 
 And we attack, we switch like the Wu Tang symbol 
 Still kill Jack even though quick and nimble, plain and simple 
 Pick niggas off while they ballin' 
 And die old like Stalin, yes 
 Death, I hear you callin', I accept collect 
 Human sacrifice, must pay respect 
 We catch wreck, nigga, we catch wreck 
 And, we gonna, gonna 
 'Cause I'mma slow it up, speed it up, slow it up, speed it up 
 Metal Fingers feed beats, Grimm Reaper eat 'em up 
 Speed 'em up, slow 'em up, speed 'em up, slow it up 
 Brainsick, tick, tick, tick, MF blow it up 
 Slow it up, speed it up, slow it up, speed it up

 Do your homework 
 King Geedorah"
7,MF Doom,hiphop,Red And Gold,"I remember when, last past November when 
 Clown kid got pounded in with the Timberland 
 They left him trembling, he was not remembering: 
 Never tuck your denim in just to floss an emblem 
 Some would debate, ""Wait, the fella ate gelatin 
 Or even listening in to what his weathermens was telling him"" 
 When I could feel it in my melanin, it's compelling 
 Us to break them off, no reassembling 
 No science-fiction to no theater near you, coming soon to 
 Fuck with you frequently like how phases of the moon would do 
 You could gather 'round like it was an eclipse 
 Just don't look directly to the bitch, you may be blinded by the crips 
 Pass the L, the last to tussle in them shirttails 
 All hail, King Geedorah, the third rail 
 700 volts holds rap to a standstill 
 Fool ignore the rule, fuck up and get his man killed 
 Two bottles of Dom got his hands filled 
 And so goes the days of our lives as the hourglass sand spill 
 And built with Passion and a glass of the 'Ze 
 (And the lights went down and hey!) 
 And I knew it was the last day ... Wig-Twisting Season 
 When some could get their wigs twisted back within reason 
 Mostly with these crimes of treason 
 And you'll be lucky if there's no squeezing even this evening 
 From how he's feeling, thrilling choice of flow is sick 
 He's the villain with the million dollar voice-throat trick 
 He's like a ventriloquist, with his fist in the speaker's back 
 Couldn't think of no uniquer track, nope, sneak attack 
 It don't really matter how big them is, so much as a nipple 
 'Cause you could have a chick with D-Triple 
 'Cept the nipple little, just hot off the griddle 
 Like how he do monkey rhymers, like Monkey-in-the-Middle by his damn self 
 Ain't no average MC ahead of me 
 Getting cheddar instead of the probably better pedigree 
 With nicknames, sick games as Rick James 
 Messy games, sci-fi such as Jesse James 
 Blast, I figure, ass-hawking ass titty licker 
 Last one to walk up in, fast-talking city slicker 
 Got bagged 'cause of the dirty chick with make-up 
 Bail out quick for the 7:30 wake-up 
 My only backup was an A-cup, as far as May 
 To when the leaves turn red and gold to Nimrod's earthday 
 All else? Worthless to say 
 (And the lights went down and hey!) 
 That's when I knew it was the first day ... Wig-Twisting Season 
 When some could get their wigs twisted back within reasoning 
 Mostly with these crimes of treason men 
 And y'all be lucky if there's no squeezing even this evening 
 ... 
 It's like a mosquit-ah, the much sweeter resent the act 
 I been bent back since my Physical went back 
 Since, Cultured more of my kin 
 And for them I keep an L rolled in this hellhole 
 Hold your head, use your head and hold, or be dead and cold 
 In the worsest way, soon as the leaves show red and gold 
 To 'round Nimrod's release day 
 And all else? Needless to say 
 Wait a motherfucking minute, true facts presented 
 The names was probably changed just to protect who ain't in it 
 The XP was three-quarters tinted, 4/5ths was converted 
 The way his shit was twisted? Ask him if it hurted 
 ... 
 ... Wig-Twisting Season 
 When some could get their wigs twisted back within reasoning 
 Mostly with these crimes of lying, and fronting, and cheating 
 All types of different styles of treason"

 You fool, it's a miracle that you didn't kill Costez as well as yourself 
 So before you cause greater harm

 This is just a minor disappointment 
 I shall overcome it) 
 Mr. Fantastic: 
 The failure of DOOM's experiment did not end his tragedy 
 For a few days later, his bandages were removed 
 DOOM and Nurse: 
 (Ah, how horrible, that thing) 
 What have I done to myself? 
 My face is hideous 
 He made me hurry my experiment 
 Now I must hide my face for all mankind 
 But he will pay, oh how he will pay 
 Mr. Fantastic and Commissioner Robins: 
 So after his face was ruined, he just seemed to disappear 
 (Why did DOOM threaten just to) 
 Well like I said he just disappeared 
 I'll never forgot that day"
11,MF Doom,hiphop,Hey!,"I only play the games that I win at 
 And stay the same with more rhymes than there's ways to skin cats 
 As a matter of fact, let me rephrase 
 With more rhymes and more ways to fillet felines these days 
 Watch the path of the black one 
 Supervillian he wrecks clubs for dell 
 In a drunken stupor chillin' 
 Ready and willin' to inadvertently foil that plan of any rhymer, whiner or 
 Spoiled brat 
 Who got more snottier flows than snotty nose? 
 And holds mics like he knows karate body blows 
 Nobody knows the trouble I see 
 From the MPB fly dirty tailin the eye bubble eye thirty 
 For the record this is some shit I just thought of y'all 
 Science fiction that's not admissible in no court of law 
 I live to rock mics 3-D 
 The only reason I seek to stop to snuff the TV 
 I heard beats, they sound like karaoke 
 With monkey rhymers on a leash like don't have this fairy choke me 
 Hit 'em with a penny so we can get these peanuts 
 And I thought we was nuts, I used to get free cuts 
 They locks Lex Luthor up in green haven 
 Since when a nigga never really been to clean shaven 
 Misbehavin rap stars need mistament 
 Call me Mista Bent 
 I'm at where your sister went 
 Intelligent, used to write and be well spoke 
 Now all a nigga wanna do is fight and sell, tell a joke 
 This could lead to catastrophe 
 Bout to stop the violence right after these last three shots from the black 
 Bat got me at headlock 
 Holdin' on to sanity while stranded at dreadlock 
 She told me get off I said 
 Bitch, let me set this shit off so I could get rich right quick 
 Then it hit me like the point of intoxication 
 Nigga come out and rock this nation like oxifacen 
 A lot of niggas out is rusty like oxidation 
 In the world's most strangest most dangerous occupation 
 But you could do it, you the Super like in your building 
 Villian like trife kingdom wear and all my children 
 Plottin and it sure to pay ends 
 With some more mature womens and more of they friends 
 And when bad men roll tight, it's actual true 
 Like a pack of big bamboo with natural glue 
 Who grip necks of becks next to triple X 
 He just came before D followed the ripple effects 
 And it'll lead you right to him 
 Oh snap, it seems you walked into a trap do wrap 
 Zoinks, this place is filled with pretender willies 
 One false move and get broke off like end of phillies 
 True believers ain't nothin' new to a 
 Crook with special powers like how to tell the future uh uh 
 Rhyme of the month two page long 
 Bustin' off two gages with my cake gone wrong 
 Son it's on remind me of a Raekwon tape song 
 With a fleet of super bad status Rae Dawn Chong 
 Let me know if y'alls with me y'all 
 Nasty yo and geographic down to the titty bar 
 Rap monster outer city y'all 
 To all my brothers who is doin' unsettling bids 
 You could have got away with it if it was not for them meddling kids"

 A fly tramp, that's what she called me 
 'Cause I don't wear no Stetson hats like Paul C 
 As y'all see, who give a fuck? Who know what is it? 
 These styles will be flipped to the absolute exquisite 
 It's like a blizzard, soon as I got home from ATL 
 Looked into my baby's face, my boo was like ... ""Well! 
 I know your types of clientele! Thoughts, needs"" 
 As I held her firmly, yet gentle as the soft sea 
 She said, ""The one with the horse weave?"" The pretty one?"" 
 All crazy, had to touch the tattoo through the short sleeve 
 Which one you want? I'm like, ""If there was comp? 
 Fuck around, a nigga like me probably run up in all three!"" 
 King Geedorah what they call me, either caesar or baldy 
 Probably half-boozed since last y'all saw me 
 On the D-low, I slaughter solo emcees, they paper-thin 
 In they Polo, Nautica, or DK men 
 Amen! It's funny how significance make a difference 
 Notice parables of three in every other inference 
 For instance: ""Who wanna battle? On the real? 
 Choose your weapon: microphone, beats, or the wheels-of-steel"" 
 I own a crown in all three for getting down without a doubt 
 I'd like to give a extra special out 
 To Jet Jaguar, the sun, moon and star 
 The Monster Island Czars - y'all know who you are 
 Get that! 
 (Tommy Gunn) 
 Coming straight from the black lungs 
 I rip tracks for all players that pack guns 
 Stack ones in packs, done and doing back-to-back runs 
 To my peeps that close, so's ya' knows what's up 
 Y'all know the dough's quick, hoes that mess with 5-O shrimp like, ""What?"" 
 Like they wanna shmoosh us, just to packing the pushers 
 I'm packing gat then bust a cap at po-po 
 If they catch us and try to push us 
 Since when a MINY nigga don't be taking no shit? 
 I be that drug dealing nigga that be fucking ya' bitch!

 What a fella! Like Salt, Pepa, Spinderella 
 I came to spark the deaf, dumb and blind like Helen Keller 
 If I'm not with George of the Jungle, if he not with Stella 
 Or either Priscilla, I'm doing dips on Godzilla 
 Though y'all know he don't play, right? 
 TNT throws a nigga out a moving van in broad daylight 
 And he was shackled by hands and feet 
 Then they say he tried to escape, once his face scraped the concrete 
 Near the curb on Monster Island, 103 Street 
 Where brothers run the risk of getting swallowed once the Beast eat 
 I'd rather lay in the cut, collect cash pay 
 Only TNT I see is Gilligan's castaway 
 With Mary Jane and Ginger 
 Oh, from which you spent the night by accident, I creep like a ninja 
 When the mack is bent, who can give one fuck? 
 Get bucked, get broke up like three-piece nun-chucks 
 Y'all sun struck, sick to they head-piece 
 Three-headed beast brings the drama to a dead cease

 She was thirteen and good we had a hotter date 
 It was just a number she never told she was knocked up 
 By the end of the summer chick almost had me locked up 
 My aunt came and got and steadied the block 
 We bounce to the yeti and I'm ready to rock 
 With no attachments feelin' a little loose 
 Blowin' up in every spot we had a little juice 
 Probably the dime on the Afghani bud in me 
 We played the stage standin by the speaker and suddenly 
 Who tapped me I'm bout to get real ill 
 Already ripped the whole club with metal face's steel wheel (The mic) 
 What a sweet surprise her with the fly eyes 
 And fine she pulled me to the sidelines 
 The mystery shot up with strong words 
 She was an intelligent wisdom and a song bird 
 I met her last week at the same place 
 She stepped to me the same way at a no shame pace 
 I'm off guard her game had me choked up 
 Checkin' me play testin me (The mic) till I spoked up 
 Seven whole days and nights and not a word from you (Not a word) 
 I was worried I thought I woulda heard from 
 Stranger you know I never get enough of you 
 How you be comin' through (The mic) 
 Myself and two a alikes had ran through this crew of three 
 In my earlier days they showed me things new to me 
 So we knew mad brothers who they had hit off 
 They even used to watch each other just to rock they shit off 
 When slovenly two smile and I'm scopin her 
 Switchin off three times a night made them more opener 
 So you could love Allah or leave him the hell alone 
 Message from my god father aside a gold telephone 
 Many of my men went up in smoke 
 While trickin with these chickens I ended up broke 
 You find out who's ya man's when you broke 
 Like a bad joke it's funny when you on you got mad folk 
 I played the middle man in every little scam 
 Some as complex as a hip hop album riddle jam 
 I find it's quite intriguing as I think about rappers 
 Walk upon me speaking with stinkin mouth (About what?) 
 About this and that from sneakers to hats to gats 
 Freak chicks with the cooty cat raps 
 And it's that including dice 'n' that 
 I'm at a black tie affair with a diva with the fatty fat 
 I play the back steady on the humble 
 But be right up front when we get ready to rumble

 Coulda took her back to the crib somehow was turned off

 Called back my secretary gatekeeper

 Tossing, turning, dreams of murder, someone's killing me 
 Of changes, there's nights I'm on a killing spree 
 All done cold blood waking up in cold sweats 
 This is such a cold world unconscious getting death threats 
 Shadows choking me, my last breath lets out my body 
 It's a conspiracy, my mind and my body's not really down with me 
 Me against the whole world? It's a little deeper 
 Me against my self, I fight the Grim Reaper 
 Swing sickle, I got my Glock bust rounds off 
 Demented, schizophrenic, I know this sounds off to you 
 I do not lie, when I doze off spirits hope I die, whatever 
 Angels waste the time, they work together 
 Scheme and plot on me, 'cause I'm the son of man 
 I hear voices from a dog like Son of Sam 
 Don't give a damn if the bullets fill me 
 I don't wanna live, I hope they kill me 
 Put me out my misery, I live in misery 
 I kill all my enemies, 'cause I love company 
 Those who seek me, are called wise men 
 Or either wise-guys I prey you comprehend 
 And realize I'm condemned 
 No rest, homicidal dreams 
 My cellmate, all he do is scream 
 Out loud how he wants to go home 
 That's funny, I'm here all alone 
 Locked, in a single cell 
 His back's bleeding, he's cold as hell 
 And I'm hoping, they turn on some heat 
 I call the C.O. to bring some extra sheets 
 ""Where'd he go?"" he walk through walls, run halls, I prey ""teach me"" 
 They don't seem him at the health try to reach me 
 I say ""please see how he feels"" 
 They said, ""He's all right but he's not real"" 
 Evaluations say I suffer from depression 
 Hallucinations, self-corration's what they're guessin 
 I'm here doing years, I'm stressin' 
 Medicate me, sedate me want me to rest an' 
 Don't take it 'cause he said that won't be best an' 
 He said I need his help and he needs me 
 ""Nigga you walk through walls, go home you're free"" 
 Home, that was far and he was turned off 
 Cause his wings was burned off

 Chased them all like Cairo did to Slobodan Milosovik 
 Anyhoo, how 'bout them Yankees? 
 Once I leave off-stage the party people thanks mee's 
 If I may speak freely nasty like the freaky-deeky 
 At your local sleazy speak-easy 
 Famely fan of the limelight

 It's risky business like hand-to-hand crack sale 
 With rappers who's better off on the cover of Black Tail 
 Jumpin' Jehosaphat, who's that? 
 Who cats who do magic like ""Tell me how you do's that"" 
 Heck no, especially those who cop pleas like gecko 
 Thought I might do techno 
 Ha ha, betcha bust out laughing at the bet 
 For no reason he get cussed out like Tourette 
 Yet tight flow to make her bad ass stutter 
 Or even crack a smile from a mad fast cutter 
 Butter, word play since third grade age 
 Back when we used to play ""Bang! Open bird cage"" 
 Hip hop Benny Hill's to penny straight 
 Get every penny weight then he chill, at any rate 
 My metal face hold with tongue release I-ring 
 Do yourself, I will continue to do my thing 
 Like Kung-Fu fighting everybody was biting 
 Then the super-villain struck again like lightning 
 In the same spot (bzzz!) now what's the chance of that? 
 And a name drop like pick the name out the hat 
 That's a known drop from the, liver conniver 
 Who vote player out the rap game like Survive while I-ah 
 Drop through greens like a nerd cat wheeling ten speed 
 So way back spin your back and then freeze 
 While I play high-ball, low-ball, to zero 
 So called rhymers, go call Cleo 
 While I, steal the show like thought-so-try-hiking

 Barred from all bars and kicked out the Carvel' 
 Keep a cooker where the jar fell 
 And keep a cheap hooker that's off the hook like Ma Bell 
 Top bleeding, maybe fella took the loaded rod gears 
 Stop feeding babies colored sugar-coated lard squares 
 The odd pairs swears and God fears 
 Even when it's rotten, we've gotten through the hard years

 Off a couple a shots and a few beers, but who cares? 
 Enough about me, it's about the beats 
 Not about the streets and who food he about ta eat

 Whether is it animal, vegetable, or mineral 
 It's a miracle how he get so lyrical 
 And proceed to move the crowd like a old Negro spiritual

 Tell 'em devil's hell no, sell y'all own Jello

 Work in the coochie, hooptie chitty chitty bang bang 
 Same name on the titty as on the name ring 
 Pretty like Baby D off ""all in the same gang"" 
 Keep my eye on her really don't trust her 
 But I treat her like a daughter, taught her how to bust a nut 
 And the heat to turn beef to horsemeat chalupa 
 Teach her how to hold it, of course he is the ""Super!"" 
 See most cats treat her like foofer 
 Or beat her to a stupor, take it from the ""Super!"" 
 Ya need to make her feel cuter 
 And lay down the G like Luther, everythin'll be ""Super!"" 
 Do for her, keep her in a new fur 
 So she look sweet when she go to meet the ""Super!"" 
 Got the buddha get the Grenadiers, twist it 
 Put it in the air, come 'ere, kiss it 
 Listen here scooter, let her try to bag you 
 When she's on the rag never let her fry the Ragu 
 Which will have you under some type of spell crying ""dag boo"" 
 Her name on ya back in her tattoo 
 Whether a bourgie broad, nerd hoe, street chick 
 Don't call her wifey if you met her at the freaknick 
 You don't want her don't waste her time, I'll dupe her 
 Oh and be a father to ya child like the ""Super!"" 
 He keep his hoes in check 
 Sends 'em out to get glows from off frozen necks 
 Tell 'em take his clothes, leave him posin nekkid for real 
 Better yet, get 'em for the check off the record deal 
 Find out where he keep the tek an the blue steel 
 Make sure for extra wreck let 'em know how you feel 
 And while he's runnin' down to all star weekend to ball 
 I'm comin' with the U-HAUL!(Super!) 
 (..Super!) (...Super!)"

 Never sold a jumbo or copped chicken with it's mumbo sauce 
 Tyson is a Fowl holocaust 
 Fill and gas your whole head up with poetry I'm fed up

 Stand up get up 
 Lunge for your knife 
 Don't forget your potholders

 What 
 These old things 
 About to throw them away 
 With the gold rings that make 'em don't fit like O.J 
 Usually I take them off with oil of ole 
 MC's is crabs in a barrel pass the old bay 
 Hot as hell and it's a cold day in it 
 Working on a way that we roll away tinted 
 Some say the price of holdin' heat is often too high 
 You either be in a coffin or you be the new guy 
 The one that's too fly to eat shoe pie 
 (Never too busy) 
 Never too busy when it comes down to you and I 
 (Swear to god) 
 A lot of niggaz wish to die 
 Need to hold they horses 
 There's bigger fish to fry 
 Your on the list 
 If not hit the number spot 
 Ten and a half Timbs is made to kick your bumbaclot 
 Could have had a V-8 
 F-150 quad cab but I'll be straight 
 Money comes and goes like that two bit hussy that night that tried to rush me 
 Dwight pass da dutchie 
 So I can calm down so they don't get it twisted 
 Take it from the fire side it won't get blistered 
 Got it 
 What happened oh it's not lit 
 These metal fingers be holding hot shit 
 (Dwight spits) 
 When I was four I penned ""God Was Born in New York"" 
 Back in seventy seven still got nan in the crescent 
 The effervescence of gods presence is thick 
 Unlike vapor 
 Escarole 
 Extra roll 
 Word to the baker 
 Peace to the hard working ginger bread makers 
 Looked her up and down said, ""Hmmmm, too much make up,"" 
 Poor music taste 
 Ten years from being grown up 
 Rappers don't blow up heads do 
 (Awwwww shit) 
 My name is Dwight Spits 
 I'ma sonic addict 
 I use to think it was merely a daily habit 
 Born under a bad sign 
 I'm serious about this curse of mine 
 I strive to flip it in the fine wine 
 Barely born a virgin is what the stars said 
 Black not white red all over, though, like Elmo 
 Twenty eight years have passed, I feel I'm peaking 
 I make music every weekend 
 It's a chore 
 A fact of life 
 A labor of love 
 I get mad love but I detest the labor 
 And it's wages 
 You know death 
 I'm serving life from this gift of god 
 Don't forget your potholders my niggas"

 Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all 
 So tell me why shouldn't it be true? 
 I get a kick out of brew 
 There's only one beer left 
 Rappers screaming all in our ears like we're deaf 
 Tempt me, do a number on the label 
 Eat up all they MC's and drink 'em under the table like 
 ""It's on me, put it on my tab kid"" 
 However you get there, foot it, cab it, Iron Horse it 
 You're leaving on your face, forfeit 
 I crush the mic, hold it like the heat, he might toss it 
 Told him tell they stole it, he told her he lost it 
 She told him ""Get off it,"" and a bunch other more shit 
 Getting money, DT's be getting no new leads 
 It's like he eating watermelon stay spitting seed after seed 
 It's the weed, give me some of what he's drooping off 
 Soon as he wake up, choking like it was whooping cough 
 They group been soft 
 First hour at the open bar and they're trooping off 
 He went to go laugh and get some head by the side road 
 She asked him to autograph her derriere, it read 
 ""To Wide Load, this yard bird taste like fried toad turd, love, villain"" 
 Take pride in code words 
 Crooked eye mold nerd geek, with a cold heart 
 Probably still be speaking in rhymes as an old fart 
 Study how to eat to die, by the pizza guy 
 No he's not too fly to skeet in a skeezers eye 
 And squeeze her thigh, maybe give her curves a feel 
 And the same way she feel it when she flow with nerves of steel 
 They call the super when they need their back, uh, plumbing fixed 
 ""How there's only one left? the pack comes in six 
 Whatever happened to two and three?"" 
 A herb tried to slide with four and five and got caught like, ""What you doing G? 
 Don't make me have to get cutting like truancy 
 Matter fact not for nothing right now you and me"" 
 Looser than a pair of 'Didas 
 I hope you brought your spare tweeters 
 MC's sound like cheerleaders 
 Rapping and dancing like Red Head Kingpin 
 DOOM came do the thing again no matter who be blinging 
 He do it for the smelly hubbies 
 Seeds know what time it is like it's time for Teletubbies 
 Few can do it even fewer can sell it 
 Take it from the dude who wear mask like a tarded helmet 
 He plots shows like robberies 
 In and out, one, two, three, no bodies please 
 Run the cash and you won't get a wet sweatshirt 
 The mic is the shottie, nobody move, nobody get hurt 
 Bring heat, like ya boy done gone to war 
 He came in the door, and everybody on the floor 
 A whole string of jobs, like we on tour 
 Every night on the score, coming to your corner store 
 There, it is done 
 Now that the representative from South Africa has been mind programmed, all of the world's leaders on earth are under my control 
 And when they meet tomorrow in special session, I, DOOM, shall be voted master of the world 
 My plan is foolproof but just in case 
 And what about snow? 
 And you keep your eyes open 
 When I tell ya, start snappin' 
 (Oh yeah, sure) 
 Uh, ladies and gentlemen 
 I am risking my life to tell you with great concern that I must warn you 
 I, I, you must listen 
 Many among you, have, have, have their minds taken over 
 (What a story, start snappin') 
 DOOM, gosh, I wish I'd brought my autograph book 
 (Your attempts at humor bore me) 
 Right lead head 
 You're weird 
 Why is everyone staring at us? 
 (Aw, I should have realized we must look like freaks to them) 
 Relax masseur, just do your thing

 What? Why I'll bend your read out meter for ya, you little

 Friends 
 MF DOOM and Whodini: 
 As you call 'em, they call you when they need something 
 Trees for the blunt, the G's for the front 
 I found a way to get peace of mind for years 
 And left the hell alone, turn a deaf ear to the cellular phone 
 Send me a letter or better, we could see each other in real life 
 Just so you could feel me like a steel knife 
 At least so you could see the white of they eyes 
 Bright with surprise, once they finish spitting lies 
 Asssociates, is your boys, your girls, bitches, niggas, homies 
 Close, but really don't know me 
 Mom, dad, comrade, peeps, brothers, sisters, duns, dunnies 
 Some come around when they need some money 
 Others make us laugh like the Sunday funnies 
 Fam be around whether you paid or bummy 
 You could either ignore this advice or take it from me 
 Be too nice and people take you for a dummy 
 So nowadays he ain't so friendly 
 Actually he woulda even made a worthy enemy 
 Read the signs, ""No feeding the baboon"" 
 Seein' as how they got ya back bleeding from the stab wounds 
 Y'all know the dance, they smile in ya face, y'all know the glance 
 Try to put 'em on, they blow the chance 
 Never let your so-called man's know your plans 
 (How many of us have them?) A show of hands 
 (Friends) is a term some people use loosely 
 I'm real choosy on what I choose to let crews see 
 You telling me, I try to act broke 
 Jealousy the number one killer among black folk 
 Fellas be under some type of spell like crack smoke 
 Ghetto Cinderellas, lead 'em right to your stack, loc 
 Just another way a chick'll lead to your end 
 I check the dictionary for the meaning of friend 
 It said, ""Person, one who likes to socialize with 
 Sympathiser, helper"" and that's about the size of it 
 Most of the time these attributes is one-sided 
 To bolster the crime, they're apt to shoot you through your eyelid 
 And they can't hide it, going wild like a white bitch 
 Sometimes you need to cut niggas off like a light switch 
 (Click) And when things get quiet 
 Catch 'em like a thief in the night, what a riot 
 I first met Mr. Fantastik at a arms deal 
 Don't let it get drastic, think of how your moms'll feel 
 When it get for real, steel get to sparkin' 
 Everything darken and ain't no talkin' 
 For somethin' so cheap it sure buys a lot of trouble 
 Ya better off focusing than tryin' to plot to bubble 
 Or else it'd be a sad note to end on, the guns we got is 
 (One's we can depend on friends) 
 Some come in the form of codependence 
 A lot of times only end up being codefendants 
 Ten bucks say they tell for a lower sentence 
 And leave you up under the jail, begging for a penance 
 It don't make no sense, what happened to the loyalty? 
 Honor amongst crooks, trust amongst royalty 
 I'd rather go out in a blaze, than give 'em the glory 
 (How many of us have) a similar story? 
 (Friends) before lovers, we used to have some type of over-standing 
 Just so when I let her get the man thing, she know its no strings 
 We could do the damn thing, but ho it's no rings 
 Just how the tramp swings, will she see 'em again? 
 That depends on how good was the skins and could she memorize the lessons? 
 It ain't no need to pretend 
 Even though she let 'em stab it, she know they just (friends) 
 Whodini: 
 Friends 
 How many of us have them? Friends 
 Ones we can depend on, friends 
 How many of us have them? Friends

 The most powerful, the most mysterious monarch in all the world

 Mr. Fantastic and Invisible Woman: 
 I know who Doom is 
 (Then tell us) 
 He happens to be the most dangerous man in the world 
 I'd hope we'd never hear from him 
 I'd hope we'd never battle him 
 But now the worst has happened and I must tell you what we're up against 
 Mr. Fantastic: 
 I first met DOOM years ago 
 When he wanted to be alone, alone to pursue his forbidden experiments 
 One day while conducting a secret experiment 
 Later, when he recovered from his injuries 
 Instead of having learned his lesson, DOOM was bitter, angry, vengeful 
 DOOM: 
 What have I done to myself? 
 My face, it is hideous 
 Mr. Fantastic: 
 He traveled the world, seeking a cure for his disfigured face 
 (I'm sorry sir, there is nothing we can do for you) 
 He traveled through remote villages, where strangers are seldom seen 
 He continued his search, never showing his face unless threatened by bandits who prey on travelers 
 Who foolishly wander alone through their domain"

 So, uh, some potential uses include, um, wrapping bolt packed in a larger package 
 And in that case, the, the wrap will actually form into a sauce when you cooked, cooked your meats 
 Um, there's also been interest in, um, development of using the wrap and then actually rip up the wrap in case you will get weary the next day

 Create a new demand for produce

 And eat more chitlins)"

 Shot the Henny straight couldn't afford to cop the cherry coke

 Keep ya mouth shut everything'll be beautiful

 While he's in his oratory glory, it's like a horror story 
 The mask is like Jason 
 They told the place not to let the basket type case in 
 He could be some kind of wacko 
 Waitin' for the chance to heat the pipes like a crack ho 
 He busted in, blessed be the Lord 
 Who believe any mess they read up on a message board 
 If so, I got bridges for the low low 
 Same bitch a-go dry snitchin' to the popo 
 Here, orange peel stogs for the whole tier 
 Feel like I've been gone over a year, came home to old gear 
 It was the shit when I first scooped it 
 At least I get to sit out in New York and curse stupid 
 Plead the fifth, sip wine stiffly 
 Patiently come up and be spiffy in a jiffy 
 Gift for the grind, criminal mind shifty 
 Swift with the nine through a fifty nine fifty 
 Well edumacated, he heard it when he meditated in deep theta 
 Let her hate the creep later 
 Dedicated cheap skata who keeps data 
 Say he stay self medicated to sleep later 
 Side effects is similar to sugar pill 
 Whoever go next on the mic he put a booger, ewww 
 And made his exit on some calm shit 
 Begged him on the regular for kegs of more vomitspit (DOOM)"
31,MF Doom,hiphop,Kookies,"One little evening alone home 
 End up with carpal tunnel syndrome 
 And here I am, known for giving heavy back aches 
 Grown and living off of Little Debbie snack cakes 
 Supposed to be checking e-mails 
 All I got is messages from ass-naked females (Cookies) 
 I don't know a Jenny 
 She said it's free and I won't owe her a penny 
 And that's the last time I saw her 
 But thousands of more horrors on online Gomorrah 
 And Sodom, they got 'em with they curls out 
 And they got a better sales pitch than the Girl Scouts 
 I wonder what I owe her 
 For a whole box of caramel coconut samoa 
 (Night, night) Okay honey, sweet dreams 
 Now it's time to get serious like Peek Freans 
 A metal hand full, wipe it on the quilt 
 Wife wake up and I'm kill't over spilt milk 
 Locked in, looking at your picture 
 Fully clothed winter and I right there with ya 
 Thinking about the last time I split your wishbone 
 A man could only wish you could do the same till he get home 
 Fat chance, at least he get snacks 
 That will have to do till a brother get back 
 Until then, smack One-Eyed Jack 
 And hope one of his peoples can hook him with a tri-pack 
 That's three different flavors 
 Chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry wafers 
 Acting all hard, bout to get beat up 
 I'll show him what time it is once I get this sheet up 
 Soon as he fell off the beat down 
 All I hear is, ""Thirteenth cell, put the sheet down"" 
 Damn CO, what the hell do she know 
 Besides the fact she wanna get dug out on the d-low 
 A workaholic with a fountain in the ink pen 
 Out in the mountains and I stopped drinking again 
 In the wee hours, he's gotten farther 
 Needing three showers, being hot and bothered 
 The whiz with her legs bent, pregnant 
 God bless the day she wondered where her egg went 
 I need a L, it's hard to drink without it 
 And could use some cookies but trying not to think about it 
 Watching BET on jazz for knowledge on file 
 Every other commercial, college hoes gone wild 
 Soft batch, I prefer the other bunch, like we got for lunch 
 Chocolate fudge butter crunch 
 Don't mess with the Ritz Bits 
 Wheat Thins, Saltines, or Triscuits (No) 
 Matzos or Cheez-Its 
 Catch sugar fits every time that he sees a nice pair of 
 Chips Ahoy, double chocolate chunk 
 Something with the bubble and the junk in the trunk 
 Even the Oreos, no matter what weather 
 Always kept 'em dipped in milk and stuck together 
 In the game he's shameless 
 Even uses a codename Famous Amos 
 It's cheaper than a short stay at the day's inn 
 And good like twenty-five cent oatmeal raisin 
 Give a hand to who invented the camera 
 Never mind the gingerbread man or the grandmas 
 Shh, make sure she don't wake from her dream chill 
 Or get caught with a handful of cream fill 
 (Cookies) It might seem ill 
 (Go wash your hands) 
 Cookies 
 (Oh, cookies) 
 We shall now vote for a new world leader 
 I nominate DOOM 
 All in favor say, ""Aye"" 
 (Aye) Oh no 
 (Point blank) 
 DOOM and Spider-Man: 
 DOOM is master of the world 
 (I'd sure hate to see that ugly mug of yours in my history book) 
 You've disturbed me for the last time 
 The Thing, Invisible Girl, and H.E.R.B.I.E.: 
 Hey you know something gang? 
 That DOOM ain't really all bad 
 (What do you mean Ben?) 
 Well on account of him, I'm having real good time I mean 
 Between you and me, I kinda like being black 
 (Well maybe if we're lucky, he'll attack us once more and send you back Benjamin) 
 Haha very funny, very very funny 
 Mr. Fantastic and Invisible Girl: 
 (He must be mad) 
 No, if anyone can do it 
 Nevertheless let's get out of here while we can

33,MF Doom,hiphop,Gazzillion Ear,"Villain man never ran with krills in his hand and 
 Won't stop rockin' till he clocked in a gazzillion grand 
 Tillin' the wasteland sands 
 Rap sold backs of treasure maps stacks to the ceilin' fan 
 He rest when he's ashes 
 Ask 'em after ten miles of his goulashes, smashes stashes 
 Chip on his shoulder with a slip on holster 
 A clip, a folder and his grip on a boulder bolster 
 They supposed ta know. It show when his aura glow 
 Get from out the row, when he get dough it's horrible 
 Time is money spend, waste, save, invest to fess 
 From ten case a cave with chicken chest S 
 Yes y'all but don't forget your trickles 
 The best ballers pitch in and rub together nickels 
 But tut tut, he about to change the price again 
 It go up each time, he blow up like hydrogen 
 Villain here, havin' one thrilling affair 
 It won't stop, top illin' till he a gazillionaire 
 Grillin' stare, yeah ya boy had drama 
 Got 'em on a mental plane, avoided bad karma 
 Once sold a inbred skinhead a nigga joke 
 Plus a brand new chrome smokin' with the triggers broke 
 I thought I told 'em firing pins was separate 
 He find out later when he tries to go an rep it 
 Took a Jehovah money for a Arabic Torah 
 Charged in advance, translate it and ignored it sorta 
 One monkey don't stop no slaughta 
 A junkie want ta cop a quarter ton, run for the border 
 Know the drill, it ain't worth the overkill 
 Flow skill, still... there's no thrill 
 Villain burn ya 10K bills in his villa 
 Villa, when it gets realer, split the skrilla with... 
 Dilla, (Dilla) mix, mix, mix 
 Do a deal for kicks and get rich quick 
 Sketch lyric, bet 'cha bottom nick on some vic 
 Ick from the drumstick, come with the dumb stick 
 Sick slick, hid in a book 
 The only way they find it if it's spittin' in a hook 
 Listen, don't look now, keep walkin' 
 Traded three beans for this cow, cheap talkin' 
 Hawk men, stalkin', hit a weed, hawkin' often 
 Cough into a coffin, might as well scoff the pork then 
 He's like Wharf, some say stronger though 
 Off the top J strong bow, play along bro 
 Wear a mask like yo off the Gong Show 
 Flow slow as Mongo, Don Juan thong pro 
 For ya info when he's not practicin' Jim Crow 
 A actress and some nympho bimbo 
 He's playin' Ray Jay the old tape 
 DOOM, well what can I say like JJ in a gold cape 
 Fill it to the rim like brim 
 Villain and ya won't find him in no gym 
 Probably a foggy bog with the frogs 
 With a dot on the guard as he squat on log 
 Half cocked and half baked 
 Used to keep a full stock of work half rocked and half shaked 
 My mistake, silent track agreement 
 For more G's than lines and cracks in the cement 
 In any event it's fake like wrestlin' 
 Get 'em like Keak da Sneak on mescaline 
 Ahem, elixir for the dry throat 
 Tried to hit the high note. Villain's just a itsy bitsy zygote 
 By remote, send in the meat wagon 
 Braggin' MC's packed in with they feets draggin' 
 These stats are staggerin' 
 Had his PHD in indiscreet street hagglin' 
 Villain, his agenda is clear 
 Endin' this year with dividends to spare, here 
 It's not meant for the scene 
 Went through the celin' after enterin' his center bein' 
 A new meanin' to sales through the roof 
 Guaranteed raw and saw his truth is truth, proof 
 It's the return of the tramp 
 Who'll do a duet jam with Earnest Goes to Camp 
 For the right earn - knaa'mean like Vern 
 We need some more oil for the machines to burn, learn 
 Jiminy crickets, he gets lucky like winnin' free tickets off simply lyrics 
 One man's waste is another man's soap 
 Sons fan base, know the brotha man's dope 
 A real weirdo, with a bug rear flow 
 And the way his hair grow was ugly as a scarecrow 
 He wears a mask so the charge won't grab 
 On a rooftop with a large stone slab 
 Heads up, talk white and thought niggerous 
 Refuse to walk tight and got his off the figure'ish 
 Black licorice is equally as yucky 
 How he handle the money was strictly Dan Stucky 
 Monkey hustle, man on fire 
 Later for the date than the hadron collider 
 And cost more, if it's seemin' like a style 
 DOOM leave the competition steamin' like a pile 
 Smile, ding! 
 Sparkling jewels, in effect like alternate side of the street parkin' rules 
 Fools, the roach is never dead 
 Live for a week, then dehydrate with a severed head. Instead... 
 It was depicted as Flik did 
 Split, the wick's lit"
34,MF Doom,hiphop,Ballskin,"The flow is towin, precision as a afro trim 
 All big letters but it isn't no acronym 
 Smacked the thin grin off a chin for crack smokin' 
 DDT the first bar, leave this track back broken 
 Chrome grown men doin' business with anglo sax and them 
 Lackin swing but that banjo's so relaxin 
 As the wax spin 
 Hackin axes in the wind pretend it's just a pen 
 See if you could pencil 'em in 
 Tense, mention men their honor fenced in 
 Sensed it is tends 
 The wheels fall off, then it's the end 
 Don't get keelhauled in, Villain always been 
 Feel real genuine ballskin 
 Not to call the whole crowd out, it's just a few chumps 
 And you know who you are like a shout out 
 Place 'em in your loud mouth and taste 'em like a pastry 
 Waste of space, face hastily, bow out gracefully 
 Disappear, reappear, disappear again 
 Villain not is ""hair"", he's no Afro-American 
 If that's the case, he be a bald-headed African 
 Takin' all the credit and jetted, astro-travellin 
 Turn the man into a mannequin for Affleck-in 
 And bein tough actin', tinactin bluff jackin 
 He's wears a mask so when he dawns his face 
 Each and every race, could absorb the bass 
 In the place to be 
 Don't believe the hyperbole 
 It's like a murder spree, get sniped verbally 
 Beat in the head with lead pipe languages 
 For street cred, leave 'em for dead, in anguishness 
 The slang suggest it was the guy in the glasses 
 And came to help the people with they minds in they a*ses 
 And set trippin', get a grip like Spaulding 
 These walls is thin, feel genuine ballskin"

 Yeah, when niggaz was rhymin hard and comin' crazy 
 Electrifyin and vivid, yo 
 I'm like a rabbi, fresh new mag and I'm mad high 
 Stolen black Jag I brag fly, yeah 
 Yo a project thug, political gangster, starvin Langston Hughes 
 Jews want the crib when the God dies 
 I'm deadly, metaphors'll dog you while I'm in the Forbes 
 First 500 niggaz who raw live 
 Yo B, the nigga Shallah, he low-key 
 But he O.G., half of his niggaz gone or in hidin 
 Federados'll sneak, police, holdin' my old piece 
 Heard the young policeman died 
 58 carats of glass, the Aston 
 Blueberry black where I keep my ices and knives at 
 One of the force rawest, yo we're British aware 
 Who get money shoot dice in his fortress 
 Mocknecks and stragglers, eightball jackets the hagglers 
 Of the rap game, post up surprise 
 I want that spot, coolin with the Supervillain team 
 All you other playboys is twats 
 Niggaz be down for the murder game 
 Run in the church, grab the rifle, put one in a nigga frame 
 I'm thirsty, hungry like a Somalis 
 Polly with them niggaz with the waves in they dome like tsunami 
 All we do is get fresh and fuck ma 
 Probably yo' baby ma gave me head in Barney's while I calmly 
 And I got giants in armies 
 While we rock mean colored clothes and don divas 
 Yeah Chef back, some call him Louis Smith 
 Slash Lex Diamond and his chick sell crack 
 We rep bananas, beat this, legend of Stan Smith 
 700 dollar jeans, keepin' your man distance 
 Yeah son, gimme your ear son 
 Yo yo yo, yo yo get the fuck away from the ropes man 
 (Yo, fuckin' chicken!) 
 {*Beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep*} 
 Doom, the warning signal again 
 Somebody approaches! 
 What matter of creatures are these? 
 There they are again, FIRE! 
 ""A gunshot from inside the house, forces a change of plans"" 
 {*Monster roaring*} 
 ""A straightforward entry, has turned into what appears to be"" 
 ""A barricaded standoff"" 
 ""Police department! come to the front door!"" 
 ""Anything you say, cracker""

36,MF Doom,hiphop,Absolutely,"Absolute power corrupts absolutely 
 If they get the villain surrounded then (AHEM!) 
 Good to the last drop nigglets 
 Hood till the blast pop them bigot-ass piglets 
 Go for the bosses, d*cks are higher 
 Beat walkers still get caught up in the crossfire 
 Get at the sarge, he give the orders 
 The rest of them punks'll quit the force or get slaughtered 
 Use stealth play, alleys, jet 
 We'd rather not alert them nosey federallies yet 
 Keep the local random cases in each state 
 Escape to the beaches for the season and be straight 
 You on call, keep your nikes on tight, no white 
 Anybody tell, get lighted on sight 
 The ring is on a need to know basis 
 No persons, places, things and no faces 
 Get bagged, you on your own, act it alone 
 Back home, your fam'll be provided fo' while you're gone 
 It's a price on all snitches 
 If you nice bring back eyes, fingers, toes an' pictures 
 Send copies to those who singin' the blues 
 Mothers an' fathers who's unjustly accused 
 Our species is in danger 
 Wear gloves an' strike in a city where you a stranger 
 That'll let them fools know 
 And send 'em a message, let them P.O.W.'s go 
 Absolute power corrupts absolutely 
 Now you have your orders, do your duty 
 A new way to let the shots spray 
 A few drops a day, double expresso, d.a. latte 
 No smell, nor taste, hardly traceable 
 Wait to waste a prosecutor, paid to get the case pulled 
 Learn 'em a lesson for givin' bros mad stressins 
 A long list of CEO's names and addresses 
 A fake judge with many years on the bench 
 And sent some good cats to the chair, was aired in a trench 
 They say her tongue was teared out, smeared and drenched 
 The whole system's scared and doubtin' a fair stench 
 And she was tortured, some say post-mortem 
 The suspect took his own life before they caught 'im 
 It's real spooky like a real trife movie 
 Remember the part when terminator killed tookey 
 Absolute power corrupts absolutely 
 If they get the villain surrounded, son, then shit... 
 Shed blood, some'll be shooken 
 Just look with they head in the mud 
 Red flood 
 Villian!"
37,MF Doom,hiphop,Rap Ambush,"Who told you dat? 
 Roll through, BRAAT! 
 Old to the new knows who holds the hat 
 Custom tailor-fitted, head stayed same size 
 Big since first born, well-spitted game-wise 
 Same guy, same disguise, sick aim eyes 
 Stare at thick dame thighs, click, claim prize 
 And the lucky contestant was sent a whole year supply of buckets of yucky excrement 
 Digital format, provide the rom, ride calm, flow is like a roadside bomb 
 Flipped the humvee, impact was limb-nubbing 
 Camera-man wig back, gunners screaming ""incoming!"" 
 RPG, rhyme propelled grenade 
 Time to yell, scramble for cover in the shade 
 Bright as the mid-day sun, then it fade 
 Darkness come quick, some run and get sprayed 
 Rot dead, hot lead, it's rainin' 
 Left 'em with they brains kicked in with they trainin' 
 Dragged the remains into the open by the bootstraps 
 Dog-tag attached to explosive human booby traps 
 Where's air support? ears ringin', mortars whistlin' 
 Blood-shot vision, afterthought: abort mission 
 Too little too late as the last man gush 
 Took no prisoners, mush, RAP AMBUSH!"

 Sparkle and gleam, light up the skies? 
 The name of the game is lightworks 
 ""I see you're peein' in your pants, little sissy boy!"" 
 Jerks 
 Welcome to the octagon 
 Lay a playa flat before the trainer felt his clock was on 
 Keep your socks torn, it's a box-a-thon 
 With hard rock, Black, Rock and Ron's gone babazon 
 Curled up, beggin, layin on the canvas 
 Instead'a in a ready position like praying mantis 
 Scissors, hand this, grand fist sandwich 
 Stand switch, slammed on stitches which hands itch 
 Damn snitch 
 Any street corner 
 Could be the platform till he defeat gone and wonder 
 Watch ya mouth, jaw south paw, house floor 
 Doubt ya clout more, bout raw, out score, boa! 
 Off the leash like UFC 
 Off the beat, off ya feet like two lefties 
 FUB's, heffer please 
 Lost a few to stew beef, new referees 
 What a remarkable team, show ya teeth 
 The shine that sparkles and gleams 
 Light up the signs 
 The name of the game is the lightworks 
 Light up the spliffs 
 The name of the game is lightworks 
 Wipe off slight smirks 
 The match was mapped out 
 Get jabbed and crap slapped out, tapped out 
 Either the lunchbin or joke whole time 
 Munchkins get punched in like vocal rhyme 
 The right hurts"

 In thigh high boots, red tighty-whities and blue cat suit (Holy Homos)

 ""You ever see me slipping like that bitch just smack me"" 
 Posing Chester, legs open, couldn't stand worse 
 All was missing was a bandana and a man purse 
 Crying, dying laughing till glands burst 
 Faster than a speeding glass, bleeding ass ran first 
 Fixing baby hair, messed up wavy curl 
 Under the cape the back of the S say baby girl 
 The things some people'll do for fame 
 It's a herb, it's a lame, It's... a god damn shame 
 Villain willing when them cold streets call 
 You can keep your hero and hold the meatballs 
 Worthy title, lock it with pockets on empty 
 He work harder than a steam engine like John Henry 
 Turn dirt to dollars like Don Henley 
 Ugly and still get hollers like Ron Jeremy 
 At least monetarily terribly 
 MCs need therapy, it's like a faris? spree 
 Hit him with a kryptonite brick (kryptonite) 
 Children come and prick his dead body with a stick 
 Wrote this lyric from in the bed with a chick 
 She had the tightest grip around the head of 
 moi

 Bic, now can I get my pen back 
 Got no enemy, got no friend, black 
 With the Green Goblin got the batcave robbed 
 Bust in Batman's head bobbin', slobbin' Robbin's knob 
 Y'all already got your belts on the floor so 
 Kick them shits over here and click off the porno 
 Alfred come home and found them both necked 
 Handcuffed to each other just as he had suspected 
 Red and chrome batmobile, wheelin' and dealin' 
 Aqua man's sleeping with the fishes, for real for squealin' 
 Pss the lo-lo on a seal skin blazer 
 It's just a little graze from a razor-thin laser 
 Amazed at all these so-called wannabe players 
 Showing off they tip offs to all the free-gayers 
 It's like a leotard fest 
 How it got started is any retard's guess 
 Regardless, that's they choice, no hate debate 
 Becomes a problem when they try an attempt to go straight 
 And raise the monster rate in the whole population 
 It's starting to affect the super pimpin' occupation 
 Now, who's the hater, headline the newspaper 
 Fate of a fake you out caped crusader 
 Tied to the tracks, make a damn tram derail 
 Rap is like scam spam Nigerian e-mail 
 The man with no beard is more weirder than a she-male 
 Sucker got bagged on a Temazepam street sale 
 Told 'em one of ours set it up, yeah doubt 
 Did it like the dirty drawls 
 Wet 'em up and air it out"

 Ay yo 
 It was three white bitches who worked for Tony Starks 
 Undercover agents, far beyond narc's 
 Amazed by they beauty marks 
 Wonder Woman bracelets, knee-high boots that was made Clarks 
 My dick got hard, at how they spoke and shit 
 Every language was music to the kid as if... 
 I was modern day King Midas 
 Doreen, Skye and Kelly, Starky's Angel's- Shaolin's finest 
 Though it happened in the streets of Brooklyn 
 Plus I played the whip real low cause my face was rooklin 
 My Angels jetted out of Albee Square 
 Gun out, wrap in their hair, kinda crowded so they clap in the air 
 Chased a nigga down block for blocks 
 Squeezing glocks, these mommies real anxious to blow off his top 
 He's a rapist, murderer, convict, burglar 
 The more they ran the more they skirts got dirtier 
 Sending shots like check day, Fed Ex expressway 
 BOOM BOW BING! You heard the gunplay 
 ""Who shot that duck out the window"" Mr. Lee said 
 ""Three pay now, you fucking weed head"" 
 We can stop the finest suspect, he's dead 
 Then I pulled up ""Come on girls to Club Med""

 Stay tuned, the Villain Three's Company 
 Don't sleep, Part One 
 Two brown sisters assisted the Villain, DOOM 
 He woked up, stoked like they was still in the room 
 Freed his right arm and leg, it was more like a sweep 
 Release his other leg, arm, head and rose to his feet 
 Staggering except for the socks and mask, naked 
 Threw on the boxers, searching for the trio 
 And checking for the keys Stacked, a robbery expected yet 
 Nothing obvious is missing 
 Recollected now why Hollywood hotties stepped into Giuseppe's 
 And naughty personnel nurses, Chanel purses, CLK shottie 
 Chased the trees with Thai iced teas 
 She drive while nice to veggie fried rice spicy 
 Told them both, ""I don't feel so well, my belly, 
 Spin me down Melrose, drive me to the telly. 
 Y'all go 'head and get the dutches, be back copy 
 Feeling woozy, no Uzi, who's he see in the lobby? Ray 
 Peace. pizza man change a hundred, stopped and looked 
 ""Nah"" Whoops! Left the knot in her pocket book 
 Wasn't the juks but too careless fearless 
 Got to the room and fell flat out on the terrace 
 The question remains who bound and gagged them? 
 That's when they found the empty pack of black Magnum

 Saving grace. Lace your broad, she say she bored 
 A crazy straw, ink and stale-dried paraffin 
 Candy corn crap rappers pale by comparison

 Make 'em sweat bullets, crime pays no benefits 
 Then it gets wilder with more childish degenerates 
 Yodel at your uncle flows, my motorcycle trunk fulls

 Standin' around for where the translucent lucid spit

 Sittin' in the kitchen, pissin', twitchin', kissin' steel lead 
 Crime pays no dental nor medical

 Aw quit it, of course I'm inclined to shine, did-ick 
 Line for line with it, climbin infinite 
 Tu no sabe? Yo soy una bien mala madre 
 Confident aren't we? Playin' it smartly 
 Word to dios Estrella is lethal 
 Flow muy frio roll the dice chico 
 Live crazy decent insanely frequent 
 Strangely sleep wit one eye open not jokin', outspoken 
 Provokin' and chokin' ego strokin is lame 
 Word bonder than James 4 alarm wit the flames 
 Way ahead of the game, still playing the same 
 Royalty in my veins it'll always remain 
 Forever doin' the thing solo or crew I can hang 
 Like ylang and ylang bring the yin to the yang 
 They got placenta for brains testing my venomous slang 
 Fools get fitted for bangs and rented for change 
 Some people think I'm deranged others a little bit strange 
 Just trying to rattle my cage 'cause I'm way outta they range"
43,MF Doom,hiphop,Microwave Mayo,"Chain smokin' beedies till his brain's broken completely 
 Get back on his feet, work out and eat some Wheaties 
 Greedy for the cheese, please, most couldn't fathom 
 Had 'em in the cobra clutch, when he spat the mad hymn gems 
 Collection of brats, timbs and hats 
 Had no time for the pitty pat, I'll give 'em that 
 The rhythm hit 'em back with a right hook 
 Shook it off, quarter shiner, thought it was a aight look 
 Depends on the shades, the end of days fades 
 Pretenders lay in dazes on stages 
 DOOM malaise 
 Eat it up, microphone, microwave mayonnaise 
 His own way was strange but it matters not 
 Tuned into a frequency tone that shattered rock 
 Hold it down like Shatner do Spock 
 Rapper jocks... need to put a sock in they chatter box 
 The block got lied to VIAC stock 
 Folks gather round it's no joke like knock knock 
 It's them, they came home to roost y'all 
 And watch 'em transform the game to the rules of foosball 
 She's too small. Any questions? 
 Him could squeeze blood from a penny in a recession 
 Keep guessin' 
 It gets deeper than depression 
 The power of suggestion awake or sleep, peep the lesson 
 Dig that beat 
 Ripped it with metal fingers and stomped it with big fat feet 
 And you know what they say: cut the hay 
 Resistance is futile, you will be assimilated, but today it's all grey 
 Metallic wood or ruby stone 
 Rude like the type of dude you could write a movie on 
 Hardcore porn - did his own stunts 
 Read his own rhymes, and split his own blunts 
 Once... in a while, every other minute 
 Eyes pop out, Popeye, heavy on the spinach 
 Steady on his business, and ready with a ill pitch 
 Keep some bad bills niche like Denny Wills and Mill snitch 
 No hitch, just a sh*tload of spit and sneeze 
 Strictly G's stackin up, off the rack the hidden fees 
 Rappers like the gay club strip tease 
 With hippies on the yip sayin' ""hey bub grip these"" 
 They screamin for attention 
 Deemin' at the mention of a scary demon convention 
 You could cut the tension wit a switchblade 
 And serve it on a same plate of hors d'oeuvres a witch made 
 Filleted, pursueded the chamber maid 
 To bet her paycheck on a get naked game of spades 
 Straight up, no chaser, no layaways 
 Coursin fate, taste of microwave mayonnaise"
44,MF Doom,hiphop,More Rhymin',"More rhyming, pure diamond, tore hymen, poor timing 
 Raw lining, Paul Simon touring... I'm in 
 Boring type an, snoring pipe when. Hyper than four hype men 
 Excited writing, trifling times ten - long stay 
 Songs play, gone haywire, wrong way on the interstate - integrate all day 
 It's just a small phase, that's what them all say 
 Then fall prey in a mini-mall hallway 
 Meant to be sold not told to friendly enemies 
 Remember these intentionally, empathy please 
 Silent moment. Violent prone atonement, miles a minute on a microphone 
 Own rent, loan spent 
 No debt, ass bet, fast get cash jet 
 Master mix smash, asterisk, stashed it, last not least 
 Pass the pot of hot grease 
 Gease shot, not easily spotted, plot cease, snot release 
 Hold your insulting tongue and mark his words well 
 Or end up to the curb and shocked by third rail 
 Get the message by bird mail or turds flail 
 Villain man best nerd male ya heard wail 
 An absurd tale of books, nooks and crannys 
 Before she look he have his fancy hooks in them granny panties, a plan B 
 When in Rome, go back home and get real dome 
 From a well known crack gnome 
 He talk to hiself 
 When he need someone to hate on 
 The black McCain campaign negative debate-a-thon 
 Gone wrong on a song 
 Who's zooming who? Knew it was you DOOM all along 
 Ever since he first started the art it's been worth it 
 Soon to charter a stint on part of the chitlin circuit 
 Word kid! Get your ticket from the telepath 
 Wikit wickit wickit! On electroencephalograph"
45,MF Doom,hiphop,That's That,"Already woke, spared a joke, barely spoke, rarely smoke 
 Stared at folks when properly provoked, mirror broke 
 Here, share strawberry morinin, gone an more important spawnin 
 Torn in, poor men sworn in 
 Cornish hens switchin positions, auditionin' mortitions 
 Saw it in a vision, ignorin prison 
 Ignoramuses enlist and sound dumb 
 Found 'em drowned in cows dung, crowds flung 
 Rings a tinkerbell, sing for things that's frail as a fingernail 
 Bring a scale, stale ginger lingers 
 Seven figures invigor 
 Nigga, fresh from out the jail, alpha male 
 Sickest ninja injury this century, enter plea 
 Lend sympathy to limper Simple Simon rhyming emcees

 These meager fleas, he's the breeze 
 And she's the bees knees for sheez 
 G's of G's 
 Seize property, shopper sprees, chop the cheese 
 Drop the bris to stop diseases, gee wiz pa! 
 DOOM rock grandma like the kumbaya! 
 Mama was a hole hoppa, papa was a rolling stone 
 Star like Obama, pull a card like oh drama! 
 Civil liberties 
 These little titties abilities riddle me, middle C 
 Give a MC a rectal hysterectomy 
 Electron removal of the bowls, foul technically 
 Don't expect to see the recipe 
 Until we receive the check as well as the collection fee 
 More wreck than section Z 
 What you expect to get for free? Shit from me, history 
 The key, plucked it off mayor 
 Chucked it in the ol tar pit off La Brea, player 
 They say he's gone too far 
 DOOM'll catch 'em after Jumar on cue lacka! 
 Do what'cha gotta do, grarrrr 
 The rumours are not true, got two ma 
 No prob, got the job, hot barred heart throb 
 Scotch Guard the bar the with cotton swabs, dart lob 
 Bake a cake, sweet 
 Jamaica trade in treats on the beach make a skeet till her feets meet 
 Can it be I stayed away too long? 
 Did you miss these rhymes when I was gone? 
 As you listen to these crazy tracks 
 Check them stats then you know where I'm at 
 And that's that"

 ""He's a villain, yes he is... 
 Verse1: Set it off adrenaline rush, the boys way beyond a pen of the dutch. 
 Stronger then hen a bag of the dust. You need to watch how they actin' wit us. 
 Now time to get it in gear, get it in right here. Revenge is better than beer, yo doom it's been a minute think they gettin' it clear. 
 When brothers reunite, Make sure we party right, we rock it all night long even beyond the morning light. 
 Its hard to see him in the light, even harder to see him on the mic, a black benz beats bein on a bike, and he can talk a gay chick outa being a dike. 
 (Doom): Keep it on click fully auto, wont stop the rock until pockets thick and gordo. 
 More so a risk of sounding poor, bro, No tux licks and stole 'em tickets to the award show... 
 Normally cordial, more or less, less is more or no. 
 Hoookkk. Hock spit out the cockpit, stuck to the window till its solid as a rock hit. 
 ""Yes he iiiisss"" 
 Verse3: He grabbed the mic like 2 money bags, waiting for the getaway to count what he had. Thought he was a spaz, but dude kept wreckin, the crowd remote control, keep 'em all guessin. Funny man gave 'em nuttin like a bummy dad tought him how to fight wit a mic and the hottest stab. But that's the life of a villain, and you know after that its chillin'. Went places got Gracie no follow and ain't got no cola in the coke bottle.writin rhymes till the pen go hollow and been flow hotter than the hot suns of Marrow. And get the villain and scream, if it's not real life its still in yo dreams. Like that y'all and like that y'all, like that a like that and like that y'all. 
 ""What rhymes with thrillin, villain."" 
 ""What rhymes with stealin, villain."" 
 ""He's a villain, yes he is."" 
 Verse4: Pushin on the couch cushion, south side minneap neva lived out in brooklyn. 
 Kept the faith forget the fame, if they sweat the name let it set the lane. 
 Held mind cold and hard, had no regard who the chosen are. Who, you? Oh no, you played the Oboe, keep it on the low low. 
 Rappers are candy butterscotch, imma let their baby mothers watch, She loves the ock I touch the spot, bitch I'm the itsh that must be a god up her crotch. Now stop leave the buildins, and leave some pills for these little villains. Here shorty, share the flask, let me explain why I wear this mask."
47,MF Doom,hiphop,Bumpy's Message,"(Bumpy Knuckles) 
 Yo what's up Doom, it's Bumpy Knuckles 
 Just calling to say that I'm proud of the work you been doing dog 
 You know this whole album and all that that you've been working on my dude 
 It's like, it's like a long time coming man for people to get a chance to 
 Look into the mind of a villain, you know like somebody who really has 
 A serious outlook on their craft, you know there's a lot of clowns out here 
 With you know, painted faces and when they take the paint off 
 It's just a clown with no paint on their face [Doom laughing] 
 So please understand my dude I'm watching you man and I see what you doing 
 It's the OG man Bumpy Knuckles straight fly, aight? 
 My motto for 2009 is fuck everybody [Doom laughing], aight? 
 So when you go on stage and you put your middle finger up to the crowd 
 Ask them to put it back up 
 And when they show respect to the villain they should say fuck everybody [Doom laughing] 
 Cause that's what everybody's gonna say when they have to show respect for you 
 Ah fuck him, fuck him that's the dinkest shit in the world if they write this 
 Well fuck you 
 Cause everybody wanna be what you are 
 You nah'mean? They can't find 
 Themselves 
 Aight, stay focused my dude I appreciate your work 
 Aight? Soon come: Bumpy Knuckles, MF Doom- soon come 
 Peace"
48,MF Doom,hiphop,Thank Yah,(Thank you) Thank ya...
49,MF Doom,hiphop,Beef Rap,"Beef rap could lead to gettin' teeth capped 
 Or even a wreath for mom dukes on some grief crap 
 I suggest you change your diet 
 It can lead to high blood pressure if you fry it 
 Or even a stroke, heart attack, heart disease 
 It ain't no startin? back once arteries start to squeeze 
 Take the easy way out, phony, until then they know 
 They wouldn't be talkin' that bologna in the bullpen 
 So disgustin, pardon self as I discuss this 
 They talk a wealth of shit and they ain't never seen the justice 
 Bust this like a cold milk from out the toilet 
 Two batteries some Brillo and some foil, he'll boil it 
 He be better off on PC glued 
 And it's a feud so don't be in no TV mood 
 Every week it's mystery meat, seaweed stewed 
 He wears a mask just to cover the raw flesh 
 A rather ugly brother with flows that's gorgeous 
 Drop dead joints hit the whips like bird shit 
 They need it like a hole in they head or a third tit 
 Her bra smell, his card say, aw, hell 
 Barred from all bars and kicked out the Carvel 
 Keep a cooker where the jar fell 
 And keep a cheap hooker that's off the hook like Ma Bell 
 Top bleeding, maybe fellow took the loaded rod gears 
 Stop feeding babies colored, sugar coated lard squares 
 The odd pairs swears and God fears 
 Even when it's rotten, we've gotten through the hard years 
 I wrote this note around New Year's 
 Off a couple a shots and a few beers, but who cares 
 Enough about me, it's about the beats 
 Not about the streets and who food he about to eat 
 A rhymin? cannibal who's dressed to kill, it's cynical 
 Whether is it animal, vegetable or mineral 
 It's a miracle how he get so lyrical 
 And proceed to move the crowd like a old negro spiritual 
 For a mil' do a commercial for Mello Yello 
 Tell 'em devil's hell, no, sell y'all own Jello 
 We hollow krills, she swallow pills 
 He follow flea collar, three dollar bills 
 And squeal for halal veal, in y'all appeal 
 Dig the real, it's how the big ballers deal 
 Twirl a L after every meal 
 Word up to all rappers, shut up with ya shuttin? up 
 And keep your shirt on, at least a button up 
 Yuck, is they rhymers or strippin? males? 
 Outta work jerks since they shut down Chippendales 
 They chippin? nails, doom, chippin? scales 
 Let alone the pre-orders that's counted off shippin? sales 
 This one goes out to all my peoples skippin? bail 
 Dippin? jail, whippin? tail and sippin? ale 
 Light the doobie till it glow like a ruby 
 After which they couldn't find the villain like Scooby 
 He's in the lab on some old Buddha Monk shit 
 Overproof drunk shit and who'da thunk it 
 Punk, try and ask why ours be better 
 It could be the iron mask or the Cosby sweater 
 Yes, you, who's screwed by the dude on the CD nude"

 ""He was a recording genius who invented this gizmo that turns bells into bombs or something!"" 
 ""Wow! gotta get outta the way of the sound waves of those bells!"" 
 Who got the most whips gats an cash? 
 If you ask the Villain, he say who gives a rats ass 
 Can't take it wit'choo you when you breathe ya last 
 In the meanin' in between pass that grass 
 Give thanks, his rank is that of big stank dank 
 He often'd time drank by the river bank 
 An kept a silver shank, for a calm cat 
 Always stayed strapped for hand to arm combat 
 For Doom the bell tolls 
 Let them fools know ain't no more room in these hell holes 
 It's filled up to the brim wit sold souls 
 Crackheads dope fiends an 40's of ol' gold 
 Hold up, the boldest who ever sold it 
 Whoever dare roll up, prepare to get folded 
 Like Holly Hobby, gosh golly gee 
 The back of Hector Hoskerish's trolly red wash me 
 Dag nabbit, the mask is like a chick magnet 
 Some'll let you stab it for a nic' of the babbit 
 They say he talk slick like Dick Cavett 
 A fiend for the mic an can't kick it like a cig habit 
 Give him a hero's holla 
 Along wit more free dough than Creflo Dollar 
 Holy toledo how he make bass on the today show 
 They say he wear a mask in case his face show 
 It's better than a stocking, bird brain 
 Find him on the corner rockin' Mockingbird lane 
 He's a odd man, grandma 
 And she's a bad mamma-jamma either squeeze the damn hammer 
 Or stop complainin, on the top he's remainin 
 A lot of pop sensations need more proper home trainin 
 The people say he's the nicest 
 He only wants to be left alone to his own devices 
 If the price is right he might sing a new smash 
 Then laugh an twist his rolly fingers moustache 
 Tear ya crew a new... gash 
 An prepare a new batch, of his own special herb goulash 
 Villain, the dork who talk funny 
 An he'll put one in ya, so watch where you walk money 
 Like sonny say, Doom all goomas they cure tumors 
 And beware of the Doomsta!"
51,MF Doom,hiphop,Blunt Drunk (All Outta Ale Remix),"(MF Doom) 
 Smack it up, flip it, pulled out, 'bout to fail 
 Sunday in the A-T-L and I'm all outta ale 
 Like a bat out of hell, tripped on a cat tail 
 Mutt drinkin' out a pail, who let the rat out the cell? 
 Got all the ingredients and recipe, might as well 
 Since last week the bootlegger been in jail 
 If all else fail, inhale the ale 
 Makin' sure they can't see your sale via snail mail 
 Mind like a sewer, servin' rhyme on a skewer 
 Doom'll step to a fine dime like he knew her 
 My black sister, she said ""Step back"" before he kissed her 
 She did the dipper and the smack just missed her 
 There go a list of politics like Henry Kissinger 
 99% of rap is just a friendly issue to 
 I'm like these dudes must have some screws loose to hate y'all 
 Or a couple of ounces short of deuce-deuce or 8 Ball 
 Y'all know it's time for the end, when the day come 
 Buy an album, get rudely insulted over fake drums 
 Same CD's you get for free, you break 'em 
 Wa-alaikum, make 'em eat they food like steak'um 
 Why she wanna ask me if I could pass the paparika? 
 One hand on the mic, the other on the beaker 
 Every week or so peaked out the lab though, eureka 
 A technique to keep somethin' uniquer in your speaker 
 For yo' information, I didn't do the beat y'all 
 It ain't my fault, if she didn't move her feet at all 
 Skeeter, got Peter to pay Paul 
 So you can drink it on Mary so she can play ball 
 ... So let her have my scrilla 
 And cut it out with all that funny hand jive will ya? 
 All this trouble for a tall glass of Olde E 
 Drink it all fast, make you haul ass slowly 
 And rhymin to remember what you told me 
 Holey moley, did you get a load of her roley poley? 
 Yo G, remind me to remember what you told me 
 Whoever don't feel him build walls like a goalie 
 One for the money, two for the better green 
 3,4-Methylene-dioxymethamphetamine 
 Told the knock kneed ghetto queen get the head fiend 
 Tell him it's for Medallin and use oxcyocetaline 
 Who needs airplay, it's all just hearsay 
 Leave a wig like it was havin' a bad hair day 
 Miracle glide master, asked him what's his secret 
 He said Shasta, and turned to formaldehyde faster 
 When I'm home with my lady, I try to duke her daily 
 One night she tried to flail me with her ukelele 
 Pack your heat, the Villain on the cover of Black Beat 
 With a bunch of crackers and some snack meat 
 ... You better have my scrilla 
 Cut it out with all that funny hand jive will ya? 
 All this trouble for a tall glass of Olde E 
 Drink it all fast, make you haul ass slowly 
 Remind me to remember what you told me 
 Holey moley, did you get a load of her roley poley? 
 Yo G, remind me to remember what you told me 
 And if you don't feel him build walls like a goalie"
52,MF Doom,hiphop,Favorite Ladies,"Mary, you make me wanna eat you 
 Everytime I see you, it's like the first time I meet you 
 Frangrance like a flower, subtle and sweet too 
 Seductive and whatever, it might as well be see through 
 Like my genie in a bottle 
 Miss could get me rich like a magaziney model 
 Before you know it, he have her on a stroll 
 Fresh and ripe, perplexin like Acapulco Gold 
 If I had to guess, just right, not a day old 
 Like a cradle robber, copped her off, shop a trailer-load 
 Know the right number, you can get her 
 And hit while you would've sold to the highest bidder like 
 Fruits and berries, bring daddy loot in a hurry 
 Just be cute and don't worry 
 Type to make a nigga hallucinate and admit it 
 Then she started losing weight, lettin everybody hit it 
 I like Ally, sometimes she gets bitter 
 Always kept me happy, never had a problem with her 
 She used to let me use her, back when I was looser 
 Respect her to this day, and never did abuse her 
 I told her I'll be faithful, but she don't believe me 
 I probably coulda been, if I never meet Eevee 
 She make me feel all fuzzy inside, it's loco 
 You won't get nowheres near her if you're broke though 
 Kept a shorty, can't find 'em much thinnner 
 If caught I get mad time just for touchin her 
 Knock wood, so much for hymens 
 So fly, she should be in the sky with diamonds 
 Little young thing, she likes to do the tongue thing 
 At times, she would play hard to get, grunting 
 Or something, she made me feel like the number one king 
 Run into her now, and we still catch a fun fling 
 Met her at Central Park this one time 
 Had the God mentally sparked, reflectin sunshine 
 She said, you need to stop messin wit that white girl 
 She fuckin' wit ya head and got ya heart in tight curl 
 We messed around once or twice, but she don't know me 
 She helped me get money at the dutch price OT 
 Plus she from Columbia, so she really Spanish 
 Cookie known to make a cat bank account vanish 
 And Miss Hazy, all the women mature black 
 Everytime she sees me, I end up gettin' pulled back 
 All she want me to do is blaze it crazy 
 The only one complaint is, she make me too lazy 
 Sugar-mommy laced me with the butter navy Avi 
 Just her way to makeup for the headaches that she gave me 
 It's all gravy, when I'm done getting my mack on 
 Ally is always there to help me get back on"

 Yo, yo, yo

 I gotta blow up they spot so I fly that knot 
 Yo, I know you like that 
 You like that! 
 Yeah, yeah 
 There's an E! True Hollywood Story for the pluckin' it's ripe 
 How cats is stuck in purgatory for life 
 Tryin' to fight the enemy without sight 
 They in the dark swingin' right to left 
 Clingin' to the little bit of light that's left 
 And can't escape the room, you can't escape the tomb 
 You all wear a mask sometimes, I can relate to Doom 
 That make the whole world earthquake, shake, and move 
 The beat create a mood or eat your whole plate of food 
 You can't come close like an order of protection 
 That this is myself in the pack was sort of my intention 
 Slaughter anybody testin' my callin', my profession 
 Anymore questions will born 'em a lesson 
 A demonstration of takin' it all the way home 
 While you stuck at first base and 
 It's like havin' relations without the penetration 
 Basically doin' nathin' 
 You a waste of space and time 
 Always chasin' mine is how you lost your place in line 
 We got that uncut flow that bring the cops out 
 Pay and groan like young Mike and get knocked out 
 Yeah, free the radio population 
 Kweli and Doom the 1-2, the combination 
 Let's go 
 About time you heard a rhyme flow with Doom and Kweli 
 To catch you with the combo, boom boom, Muhammad Ali 
 Versus Potsy cursin' Yahtzee at the crap table 
 Burstin' caps at a Nazi rap label 
 Oops, a pot of hot tea spilt on the cable 
 Evaporate an ice grill, read the seeds of Aesop fable 
 Children, come sit, gather 
 Face the rapid fire of the super slap shit outta liar 
 The end 
 Villain, the champ tramp 
 Flowin' since they had him holdin' 
 He cleaned his mask with a shoe mitt 
 And a little bit of her blue spit 
 She told him you so stupid 
 Wiped it off, got dressed and left 
 Everybody instigatin', not just the ref 
 We can shoot the fire on the dirt ground 
 Rocks out live with the worst sound 
 First round knock out 
 We got that uncut flow that bring the cops out 
 Pay and groan like young Mike and get knocked out 
 Yeah, free the radio population 
 Kweli and Doom the 1-2, the combination

56,MF Doom,hiphop,Is He Ill?,"Well Is He Ill? [yes] 
 Do he really fit the bill? [yes] 
 Spit to kill? [yes] 
 Keep things real? [yes] 
 Know the drill? [yes] 
 The ledge edge? [yes] 
 And still ...[yes] 
 And catch wreck at will? [yeah] 
 2xs 
 Todays forecast, a slight chance of flurries 
 A slightly slim chance they might dance to worries 
 I won't know to say, break through a cut away 
 Doom like the rain known to come back another day 
 Like this day like now-a-day be right there 
 Like [I, O, A], gimme half a light year 
 Same time it take y'all to drink a light beer 
 Feel the wrath of the tooth just like the cast of nightmare 
 Whoever got the cash, the mic, they both right here 
 What more can I say? keeps your sights clear 
 Bare facts, strip you naked to bare backs 
 The [owner] can't do jack rare tracks for your earwax 
 Oh snap! You hear that? Naw 
 Doomsday way up in the cut like maw and paw 
 When he come out he dumb out 
 There he go! 
 The villain with the illest flow in all of Mexico 
 All foes on some when he leave out let me know 
 Just soes I can breath out before I let go 
 Rappers is like saschmo that you best know 
 Invested free dough like matthew lets go! 
 Sh-- followed by hail storm, snow and earthquakes 
 Give out more toothaches than first birthday cakes 
 The more we reverse scripts the worse they fate 
 To beat cha'll with dimes on dummy [ambesol shake] 
 Now you got a rhyme tummy ache by mistake 
 Can't call it, can't call jake, call cannonball face 
 [Dig tapes] and stay in great shape, 
 Today's rap game is like one big date rape 
 M-F! the name ring bell like ring ding dong 
 He can never be wrong like ling ting tong 
 Once heard a hit song, sounded like an annoying gong 
 Tt's so wack, I didn't wanna hit the bong 
 Now who get iller with the pen than I do? 
 And in it just to get the benjamin like netenyahu? [not you] 
 Let the god bless you like Achoo! 
 Get you like what's that on your chest clook! gotchu 
 [PMS deep] good for you its shredded wheat 
 As well as getting shredded by the metal headed lead feet 
 Sun 'em and done 'em like a dad that's dead beat 
 Beat him like a dead horse nasty as red meat 
 Doom memorize rhymes and still forgot 
 Call it how he see it and kill a shot, like willard scott 
 In the place to be like no iller spot 
 To spill a knot, it's like a chilling thriller plot 
 Starring the villain as the black Jesus 
 If it ain't yack or the jack is the grey goose 
 [Stoke] can stay loose off grape juice regardless 
 Never-the-less did his best on the retarded test 
 Was trick questions, always kept a cheat sheet 
 On the microphone, a repper before beat street 
 And beat meat that MF doom he stay tru 
 If you online check the site and FAQ 
 Is He Ill? [yeah] 
 Do he really fit the bill? [yeah] 
 Spit to kill? [yup]

57,MF Doom,hiphop,My Favorite Ladies (Latina Remix),"Mary, you make me wanna eat you 
 Everytime I see you, it's like the first time I meet you 
 Frangrance like a flower, subtle and sweet too 
 Seductive and whatever, it might as well be see through 
 Like my genie in a bottle 
 Miss could get me rich like a magaziney model 
 Before you know it, he have her on a stroll 
 Fresh and ripe, perplexin like Acapulco Gold 
 If I had to guess, just right, not a day old 
 Like a cradle robber, copped her off, shop a trailer-load 
 Know the right number, you can get her 
 And hit while you would've sold to the highest bidder like 
 Fruits and berries, bring daddy loot in a hurry 
 Just be cute and don't worry 
 Type to make a nigga hallucinate and admit it 
 Then she started losing weight, lettin everybody hit it 
 I like Ally, sometimes she gets bitter 
 Always kept me happy, never had a problem with her 
 She used to let me use her, back when I was looser 
 Respect her to this day, and never did abuse her 
 I told her I'll be faithful, but she don't believe me 
 I probably coulda been, if I never meet Eevee 
 She make me feel all fuzzy inside, it's loco 
 You won't get nowheres near her if you're broke though 
 Kept a shorty, can't find 'em much thinnner 
 If caught I get mad time just for touchin her 
 Knock wood, so much for hymens 
 So fly, she should be in the sky with diamonds 
 Little young thing, she likes to do the tongue thing 
 At times, she would play hard to get, grunting 
 Or something, she made me feel like the number one king 
 Run into her now, and we still catch a fun fling 
 Met her at Central Park this one time 
 Had the God mentally sparked, reflectin sunshine 
 She said, you need to stop messin wit that white girl 
 She fuckin' wit ya head and got ya heart in tight curl 
 We messed around once or twice, but she don't know me 
 She helped me get money at the dutch price OT 
 Plus she from Columbia, so she really Spanish 
 Cookie known to make a cat bank account vanish 
 And Miss Hazy, all the women mature black 
 Everytime she sees me, I end up gettin' pulled back 
 All she want me to do is blaze it crazy 
 The only one complaint is, she make me too lazy 
 Sugar-mommy laced me with the butter navy Avi 
 Just her way to makeup for the headaches that she gave me 
 It's all gravy, when I'm done getting my mack on 
 Ally is always there to help me get back on"

 Yo, yo 
 Bring in the big guns, weapons is ready 
 In the square shoot the heady reppin the yeti is ready 
 Bout time last train from Gun Hill, Dunn chill 
 Stay filled with exhiliration from one kill 
 (Scott Free) 
 Yo, rock for ? row don't tempt me 
 Smack the drum black, black rap Jack Dempsey 
 You get laced without a trace just for takin' up space 
 Bill Bill the bombville you still catch a Gas Face 
 For real"
60,MF Doom,hiphop,Rock Co. Cane Flow,"Up in them five star tellies and two mic rhymes 
 Be them average MC's of the times 
 Unlike them, we craft gems 
 So systematically inclined to pen lines 
 Without sayin' a producer's name all over the track 
 Yeah, I said it, what you need to do is get back 
 To reading credits, we them medics 
 Alphabetically stuck on that English shit 
 Knock it, knock it before we pour that 
 Sure shot more Rock Co. Kane flow 
 From the top of the key, the 3 Villain 
 Been on in the game as long as you can wheelie Schwinn 
 Turn the corner spinnin', bust that ass and get up 
 Dust off the mask, whoever laugh give him a head up 
 He got jumped, it pumped his adrenaline 
 He said it made him tougher than a bump of raw medicine 
 To write all night long, the hourglass is still slow 
 Flow from Hellborn to Free Power like Wilco 
 And still owe the bills, pay dues forever 
 Slay huge when it comes to who's more cleverer 
 Use to wore a leather goose ski with a fur collar 
 Hand charged a fee for loose leaf words for dollar, ya heard? Holla 
 Broad or dude, we need food 
 Eat your teams for sure, the streets sure seem rude 
 For fam like the partridges, pardon him for the mix-up 
 Battle for your Atari cartridges or put your kicks up, it's a stick up 
 Now put your blix up 
 These Riddick Bowe cuts, is swoll like penile flicks, give 'em 20 
 The danger in his eyes'll let you know he's a brawler 
 Bring your tallest champs like that much taller 
 Ten pounds heavier, one step ahead of it 
 Vocab, stamina, style's all irrelevant 
 Camps and cliques, units, squad crews and clans 
 Even your tongues'll fuck around and leave your mouth 
 Doom brung that bum, there goes that news van again 
 Act like you knew like, Toucan Sam an' 'em 
 He eat rappers like part of a complete breakfast 
 Your rhymes ain't worth the weight of they cheap necklace 
 String 'em up, bring 'em up under whack junk snack 
 And get that out your hand, punk, jump and get your dunk smacked 
 Foul, we all know the rules, bro 
 You slow, you blow the soup on your fools, his Impulse like Yugo 
 You go lights, camera, action with no makeup 
 We, De La to the death, or at least until we break up 
 Here's a couple of nice guys who finished first 
 So nice try, but the prize is ours dispersed 
 They say the good die young, so I added some 
 Bad ass to my flavor to prolong my life over the drum 
 Everyone cools off from bein' hot 
 It's about if you can handle bein' cold or not 
 And we was told to hop on no one's dick by Prince Paul 
 We stayed original ever since y'all 
 First to do a lot of things in the game, but the last to say it 
 No need to place it on a scale to weigh it 
 And don't do it for the plays or to raise the bar 
 Yet it's raised anyway, so amazin' are 
 The three L.I. brothers from a other way of thinkin' 
 Hey, your lady's winkin', I think you need to control that 
 Or I have to hold that 
 The elements are airborne, I smell the success 
 Yo, let's cookie cut the shit and get the gingerbread man 
 Sacrifice mics and push drugs to these rappers 
 Puff ponies 'til I turn blue in the lips 
 Sippin' broads like 7 Up, so refreshing 
 I think I'll pop these verses like first dates to birthdates 
 September 2 1, 1 9, 6 8 
 Too old to rhyme, too bad, too late"
