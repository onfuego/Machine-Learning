0,Led Zeppelin,rock,Good Times Bad Times,"In the days of my youth 
 I was told what it means to be a man 
 And now I've reached that age 
 I've tried to do all those things the best I can 
 No matter how I try 
 I find my way to the same old jam 
 Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share 
 When my woman left home for a brown-eyed man 
 But I still don't seem to care 
 Sixteen, I fell in love with a girl as sweet as could be 
 It only took a couple of days till she was rid of me 
 She swore that she would be all mine and love me till the end 
 But when I whispered in her ear, I lost another friend, oh 
 Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share 
 When my woman left home for a brown-eyed man 
 But I still don't seem to care 
 Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share 
 When my woman left home for a brown-eyed man

 I don't care what the neighbors say 
 I'm gonna love you each and every day 
 You can feel the beat within my heart 
 Realize, sweet babe, we ain't never gonna part 
 I feel good when I look into your eyes."

 Of how we calmed the tides of war

 Just a simple guy, and live from day to day 
 A ray of sunshine melts my frown, blows my blues away 
 There's nothin' more that I can say 
 But on a day like today, I'll pass the time away 
 And walk a quiet mile with you

 A-one thing that I know for sure 
 Gonna give her all the lovin' like nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody can 
 Standin' in the noon-day sun tryin' to flag a ride 
 People go and people come, see my rider right by my side

 And so I say to you that nothing really matters 
 And all you do is stand and cry 
 I don't know what to say about it

 And then she turned to go 
 The Prince of Peace embraced the gloom 
 And walked the night alone 
 Oh, dance in the dark of night 
 Sing to the morning light 
 The Dark Lord rides in force tonight 
 And time will tell us all 
 Oh, throw down your plow and hoe 
 Rest not to lock your homes 
 Side by side, we wait the might 
 Of the darkest hour of them all, oh 
 I hear the horses' thunder 
 Down in the valley below 
 I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon 
 Waiting for the eastern glow 
 The apples of the valley hold 
 The seeds of happiness 
 The ground is rich from tender care 
 Repay, do not forget, no, no 
 Oh, dance in the dark of night 
 Sing to the morning light 
 The apples turn to brown and black 
 The tyrant's face is red 
 Oh, war is the common cry 
 Pick up your swords and fly 
 The sky is filled with good and bad 
 Mortals never know, oh, now 
 Oh well, the night is long 
 The beads of time pass slow 
 Tired eyes on the sunrise 
 Waiting for the eastern glow 
 The pain of war cannot exceed 
 The woe of aftermath 
 The drums will shake the castle wall 
 The ringwraiths ride in black, ride on 
 Oh, sing as you raise your bow (ride on) 
 Shoot straighter than before 
 No comfort has the fire at night 
 That lights the face so cold 
 Oh, dance in the dark of night 
 Sing to the morning light 
 The magic runes are writ in gold 
 To bring the balance back, bring it back 
 At last the sun is shining 
 The clouds of blue roll by 
 With flames from the dragon of darkness 
 The sunlight blinds his eye, oh, ooh 
 Ah, ah 
 Bring it back, bring it back 
 Bring it back, bring it back 
 Bring it back, bring it back 
 Bring it back, bring it back

29,Led Zeppelin,rock,Stairway To Heaven,"There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold 
 And she's buying a stairway to Heaven 
 When she gets there, she knows if the stores are all closed 
 With a word she can get what she came for 
 And she's buying a stairway to Heaven 
 There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure 
 'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings 
 In a tree by the brook there's a songbird who sings 
 Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven 
 It makes me wonder 
 It makes me wonder 
 There's a feeling I get when I look to the west 
 And my spirit is crying for leaving 
 In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees 
 And the voices of those who stand looking 
 It makes me wonder 
 It really makes me wonder 
 And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune 
 Then the piper will lead us to reason 
 And a new day will dawn for those who stand long 
 And the forests will echo with laughter 
 If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now 
 It's just a spring clean for the May Queen 
 Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run 
 There's still time to change the road you're on 
 And it makes me wonder 
 Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know 
 The piper's calling you to join him 
 Dear lady can you hear the wind blow, and did you know 
 Your stairway lies on the whispering wind, oh 
 And as we wind on down the road 
 Our shadow's taller than our soul 
 There walks a lady we all know 
 Who shines white light and wants to show 
 How everything still turns to gold 
 And if you listen very hard 
 The tune will come to you at last 
 When all are one and one is all, yeah 
 To be a rock and not to roll 
 And she's buying a stairway to Heaven"

 And you know how it is 
 I really don't know what time it was, whoa-oh-oh 
 So I asked them if I could stay awhile. 
 I didn't notice, but it had got very dark and I was really, 
 Really out of my mind 
 Just then a policeman stepped up to me asked us said 
 ""Please, hey, would we care 
 To all get in line, get in line."" 
 Well, you know 
 They asked us to stay for tea and have some fun, whoa-oh-oh 
 He said that his friends would all drop by, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh. 
 Why don't you take a good look at yourself and describe what you see 
 And baby, baby, baby, do you like it? 
 There you sit, sittin' spare like a book on a shelf rustin' 
 Ah, not tryin' to fight it 
 You really don't care if they're comin', whoa-oh-oh 
 I know that it's all a state of mind, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh. 
 If you go down in the streets today, baby, you better 
 You better open your eyes, whoa-oh yeah 
 Folk down there really don't care, really don't care, don't care, really don't

 I don't think I can hold out long. 
 And when the owls cry in the night 
 Oh, baby, baby, when the pines begin to cry 
 Baby, baby, baby, how do you feel? 
 If the river runs dry, baby, how would you feel? 
 Craze, baby, the rainbow's end 
 Mmm, baby, it's just a den 
 For those who hide 
 Who hide their love to depths of life 
 And ruin dreams that we all knew so, babe.

 Smoke my stuff and drank all my wine 
 Made up my mind make a new start

 Someone told me there's a girl out there 
 With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair 
 Took my chances on a big jet plane 
 Never let 'em tell ya that they're all the same 
 Oh, the sea was red and the sky was grey 
 Wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today 
 Mountains and the canyons start to tremble and shake 
 The children of the sun begin to awake 
 Watch out 
 Seems that the wrath of the gods 
 Got a punch on the nose and it's starting to flow 
 I think I might be sinkin' 
 Throw me a line, if I reach it in time 
 Meet you up there where the path 
 Runs straight and high 
 To find a queen without a king 
 They say she plays guitar and cries and sings, la la la la 
 Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn 
 Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born 
 Standin' on a hill in my mountain of dreams 
 Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems, mmm ah"

 Mellow is the man 
 Who knows what he's been missing 
 Many, many men 
 Can't see the open road

 They carry news that must get through 
 They choose the path where no one goes 
 They hold no quarter 
 They hold no quarter. 
 Walking side by side with death 
 The devil mocks their every step 
 The snow drives back the foot that's slow 
 The dogs of doom are howling more 
 They carry news that must get through 
 To build a dream for me and you 
 They choose the path that no one goes

 Singing to an ocean, I can hear the ocean's roar 
 Play for free and play for me and play a whole lot more, more 
 Singing about good things and the sun that lights the day 
 I used to sing on the mountains, has the ocean lost its way 
 I don't know 
 Sitting round singing songs till the night turns into day 
 Used to sing on the mountains, but the mountains washed away 
 Now I'm singing all my songs to the girl who won my heart

 To live the dreams we always had. 
 Whoa, the songs to sing 
 When we at last return again. 
 Sending off a glancing kiss 
 To those who claim they know 
 Below the streets that steam and hiss, 
 The devil's in his home.

 That hides inside and is never seen, yeah. 
 Into the sun of south and north

 The shackles of commitment fell 
 In pieces on the ground. 
 Whoa, to ride the wind 
 To tread the air above the din. 
 Whoa, to laugh aloud 
 Dancing high above the crowd, yeah. 
 Seek the man whose pointing hand 
 The giant step unfolds 
 With guidance from the curving path 
 That churns up into stone 
 If one bell should ring 
 Celebration for a king 
 So fast the heart should beat 
 As proud the head with heavy feet, yeah. 
 Days went by when you and I 
 Made an eternal summer's glow 
 As far away and distant 
 Our mutual time to grow. 
 Whoa, the sweet refrain 
 It soothes the soul and calms the pain.

 Sleeping now to rise again. 
 Wandering the wanderings 
 What place to rest the search?

 Out at a hotel in the quarter 
 Our friends check in to pass the night 
 Now love gets hot 
 But fire preceded water 
 Poor whiskers set the room alight

 Down on Bourbon Street 
 You know, it's right 
 You can see, my friend 
 They run around all through the night 
 Most everywhere 
 Until the closet's bare 
 Run for the razor fun 
 Doin' up my hair

 Sure know how to schmooze it 
 Maybe for some that seems alright 
 When I step out 
 Strut down with my sugar 
 She'd best not talk like Barry White!

 Our love, a plot, a pick-up truck 
 But folks said she was after something more 
 I never did quite understand 
 All that talk about rockin' bands 
 But they just rolled my doll right out the door 
 Ooh yeah, they just rolled my doll right out the door 
 Why, well, they just rolled my doll right out the door"
67,Led Zeppelin,rock,Carouselambra,"Sisters of the way-side bide their time in quiet peace, 
 Await their place within the ring of calm; 
 Still stand to turn in seconds of release, 
 Await the call they know may never come. 
 In times of lightness, no intruder dared upon 
 To jeopardize the course, upset the run; 
 And all was joy and hands were raised toward the sun 
 As love in the halls of plenty overrun. 
 Ah, ah, ah, ah. 
 Still in their bliss unchallenged mighty feast, 
 Unending dances shadowed on the day. 
 Within their walls, their daunting formless keep, 
 Preserved their joy and kept their doubts at bay. 
 Faceless legions stood in readiness to weep, 
 Just turn a coin, bring order to the fray; 
 And everything is soon no sooner thought than deed, 
 But no one seemed to question in anyway. 
 Ah, ah, ah, ah. 
 How keen the storied hunter's eye prevails upon the land 
 To seek the unsuspecting and the weak; 
 And powerless the fabled sat, too smug to lift a hand 
 Toward the foe that threatened from the deep. 
 Who cares to dry the cheeks of those who saddened stand 
 Adrift upon a sea of futile speech? 
 And to fall to fate and make the 'status plan' 
 And the Lord there in heaven would never preach. 
 I'm singin', 
 Ah, ah, ah, ah. 
 Where was your word, where did you go? 
 Where was your helping, where was your bow? Bow. 
 Dull is the armor, cold is the day. 
 Hard was the journey, dark was the way. Way. 
 I heard the word; I couldn't stay. Oh. 
 I couldn't stand it another day, another day, 
 Another day-ay, day-ay, another day, another day. 
 Touched by the timely coming, 
 Roused from the keeper's sleep, 
 Release the grip, throw down the key. 
 Held now within the knowing, 
 Rest now within the peace. 
 Take of the fruit, but guard the seed. 
 They had to stay! 
 Held now within the knowing, 
 Rest now within the beat. 
 Take of the fruit, but guard the seed. 
 Oh, take of the fruit, but guard the seed."
68,Led Zeppelin,rock,All My Love,"Should I fall out of love, my fire in the light 
 To chase a feather in the wind 
 Within the glow that weaves a cloak of delight

 As he would check the wheels. 
 Singin' poor Tom, Seventh Son, 
 Always knew what's goin' on. 
 Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom 
 And there ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom. 
 He worked for thirty years 
 Sharin' hopes 'n' fears 
 Dreamin' of the day 
 He could turn and say 
 Poor Tom, work's gone, 
 Lazin' out in the noonday sun. 
 Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom 
 And there ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom. 
 His wife was Emmie May 
 One of many games she played 
 When Tom was out of town, 
 She couldn't keep her dresses down. 
 A-poor Tom, Seventh Son, 
 Always knew what's goin' on. 
 Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom 
 And there ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom. 
 And so it was one day 
 People got to Emmie May 
 A-Tom took a gun in his hand 
 And stopped all the runnin' around. 
 Poor Tom, Seventh Son, 
 Gotta die for what you've done. 
 All those years of work are thrown away. 
 To ease your mind, is that all you can say? 
 But what about that grandson on your knee? 
 And then wrote songs as well as he could be. 
 Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom 
 And there ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom 
 And there ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom

 There's still time to change the road you're on

 The piper's calling you to join him 
 Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow 
 And did you know 
 Your stairway lies on the whispering wind 
 And as we wind on down the road 
 Our shadows taller than our soul 
 There walks a lady we all know 
 Who shines white light and wants to show 
 How ev'rything still turns to gold 
 And if you listen very hard 
 The tune will come to you at last

 Someone told me there's a girl out there 
 With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair 
 Took my chances on a big jet plane 
 Never let 'em tell you that they're all all the same 
 The sea was red and the sky was grey 
 I wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today 
 Hills and the canyons start tremble and shake 
 As the children of the sun began to awake, watch out 
 Seems that the wrath of the Gods 
 Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow 
 I think I might be sinking 
 Throw me a line if I reach it in time 
 I'll meet you up there where the path 
 Runs straight and high 
 To find a queen without a king 
 They say she plays guitar and cries and sings, la la la 
 Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn 
 Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born 
 Standing on a hill in a mountain of dreams 
 Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems, it's hard"

 Even when they scared me, out of, out of my shoes 
 Let me tell you girl that you ain't a-never seen nothin' yet 
 There ain't a thing in this world I can't never get 
 Lord you know, yeah 
 Give me, ... and I turn to stone 
 Let me put this world in the palm of your hand 
 Say you love me 
 And I know that half the battle is won 
 Don't you worry 'bout nothin' 
 I said I love you babe 
 Let me tell you girl 
 You ain't seen nothin' yet 
 There's not a thing in this world 
 I can never get 
 As long as I have your 
 Shake, ma ma ma 
 I feel a little bit lonely baby 
 But I never get a little lonely baby 
 I said I'm gonna love you 
 I'm a gonna think about 
 My darlin' darlin' darlin' 
 How I love you, Oh 
 Every day I work so hard 
 I bring home my pay 
 And people tell me baby 
 Oh babe 
 Sweet is the love that I have for you 
 Sweet is the love that I have for you 
 Sweet is the love that I shared with you 
 Hey, yeah, all right 
 Hey, yeah, all right 
 Born in darkness 
 I fought my way back to the blue 
 I got a lot of sadness 
 People when they scared me 
 Out of my shoes 
 Ah let me tell you girl 
 That you ain't seen nothin' yet 
 I can't find a thing in the world 
 That I can't get 
 As long as I have you 
 I want my babe 
 I want my babe 
 Well I told you 
 Why don't you hush pretty baby 
 I'm gonna give you you good, good, good, good, good 
 Good loving 
 I'm gonna do it to you 
 I'm not gonna tell you, no no 
 Every thing is gonna be fine 
 As long as I have you"

 Rainclouds brings me down 
 I know forever after 
 I need the light, keep me ground 
 Whoa mama, I get so lonely 
 In the rain, feel so blue 
 I want you to remember, I'm your one and only, woman 
 Hey baby, hey baby, love you true! 
 Dream boy, on the river 
 Oh blue skies, on my mind 
 Ah the fields, seemed to glitter 
 I know, I know, will bring you down! 
 Ah baby, I've got some thinking 
 Whoa mama, strip my mind 
 Hey baby, I took a drinking 
 I know, I know come around! 
 In the light, in the light 
 Oh girl, stop your crying 
 Oh woman, dry your eyes 
 Whoa tomorrow, the sun will be shining 
 You won't remember all the tears you cried! 
 Hey baby, I think you wonder 
 Hey baby, tears of joy 
 Woman, tears of laughter 
 Sweet ma, sweet ma, I'm coming home! 
 'S all you got to do yeah! 
 With the light 
 Everybody needs the light 
 The light 
 'S all you got to do now!

 Light, light, light, in the light!"
