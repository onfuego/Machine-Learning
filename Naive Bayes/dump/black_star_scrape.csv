0,Black Star,hiphop,Intro,"(Dave Chappelle) 
 Our keynote speaker is about to come on and I just wanted to say a few words about him and you all know who he is... Talib Kweli! Please, hold your applause until the end. We are GLAD to come and hear you speak. We love it! Kweli doesn't like me to talk about this but one time we were driving through the Mississippi delta and there was a brotha runnin' up the side of the road and he didn't have any shoes on. He didn't have a shirt on and I started to drive right by this man. Kweli said ""Stop the car because that brotha might be in trouble"" and I stopped the car. Kweli said to the man he said ""Brotha are you ok do you need a ride somewhere?"" and the man looked at Kweli and said ""Shhhhhh... I'm escapin!"" and Kweli took him by the hand and said ""My brotha you didn't get the memo, we have been free for some time now"" well I'm wisinen up. Please welcome good friend, scholar, ghetto philosopher, three time Nobel peace prize winner, first black man to pilot an aircraft, the nigga that made up the Nike swoosh, the man that made Koolaid say ""oh yeah!"" Brooklyn's own... 
 Talib Kweli."
1,Black Star,hiphop,Astronomy (8th Light),"(Mos Def) 
 Against the canvas of the night 
 Appears a curious celestial phenomena 
 Called Black Star, but what is it? 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 Black people unite and let's all get down 
 We got to have what? We got to have that love 
 (Mos Def) 
 What is the Black Star? 
 Is it the cat with the black shades, the black car? 
 Is it shinin' from very far, to where you are? 
 It is commonplace and different 
 Intimate and distant 
 Fresher than an infant 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 Black, my family thick, like they're striped molasses 
 Star, on the rise, in the eyes of the masses 
 Black is the color of my true love's hair 
 Star's are bright, shining, hot balls of air 
 (Mos Def) 
 Black like my baby girl's stare 
 Black like the veil that the muslimina wear 
 Black like the planet that they fear, why they scared? 
 Black like the slave ship that later brought us here 
 Black like the cheeks that are roadways for tears 
 That leave black faces well traveled with years 
 Black like assassin cross-hairs 
 Blacker than my granddaddy armchair 
 He never really got no time to chill there 
 Cause this life is warfare, warfare 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 Deep on the front lines, and blacks is all there 
 Black like the perception of who, on welfare 
 Black like faces at the bottom of the well 
 I've been there before 
 To bring the light and heat it up like ""la cocina"" 
 Make without imagine happen but maybe I'm just a dreamer 
 I love rockin' tracks like John Coltrane love Naema 
 [M] Like the student love the teacher 
 [T] Like the prophet love Khadeja 
 [M] Like I love my baby features 
 [A] Like the creator love all creatures 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 Who acknowledge truth and peace seekers 
 We on point like heat seekers 
 Targettin' the black marketing strategists 
 Run up on 'em with the heaters 
 Everybody followin' with no leaders 
 Feelin' like we killin' ourselves 
 Because I know they can't defeat us 
 It don't stop till we complete this, keep this fly 
 There's so much to life when you just stay Black and God 
 (Mos Def) 
 Blacker than the nighttime sky of Bed-Stuy in July 
 Blacker than the seed in the blackberry pie 
 Blacker than the middle of my eye 
 Black like feh-lah man cry 
 Some man wan ask ""Who am I?"" 
 I simply reply, ""The U.N.I., V.E.R.S.A.L. Magnetic"" 
 Work to respect the angelic, climb the mountaintop 
 And tell it till the valley's enveloped 
 You're full of big chat but you nah know me 
 I'm dark like the side of the moon you don't see 
 When the moon shine newly 
 [M] You know who else is a Black Star? (Who?) Me 
 [T] You know who else is a Black Star? (Who?) Me 
 [A] You know who else is a Black Star, who we? (And we) 
 [A] be shinin' and shinin', when we rhymin' and rhymin' 
 We be shinin' and shinin', when we rhymin' and rhymin' 
 (Mos Def) 
 Now everybody hop on the one, the sounds of the two 
 It's the third eye vision, five side dimension 
 The 8th Light, is gonna shine bright tonight 
 It's the third eye vision, five side dimension 
 [T] You know the light 
 [M] Go from the dark 
 [T] The other way is ass-backwards 
 [M] It's absurd 
 [T] Make you wanna crow like a blackbird 
 [M] That's right 
 [T] You livin' from your first day to your last night 
 [T] Sometimes you show your ass like 
 [M] Lint on your clothes 
 [T] When you froze in 
 [A] the black light 
 [M] Dead that 
 [T] Before you get your head wrapped 
 [M] Like Badu 
 [T] We see through your voodoo 
 [T] Just like Eve's Bayou, you dealin' with that black magic 
 [M] Try to civilize you 
 [T] Not walk on by you 
 [M] Like civil-(lies do get you black listed) it'll 
 [T] Be unlucky for you like a black cat 
 [M] A panther 
 [T] Revolution is the answer 
 [M] That's what we need 
 [T] Greed plague my people like the cancer 
 [M] True indeed 
 (Mos Def) 
 Now black people unite, and let's ALL GET DOWN 
 Now everybody hop on the one, the sounds of the two 
 It's the third eye vision, five side dimension 
 The 8th Light, is gonna shine bright tonight 
 Everybody hop on the one, the sounds of the two 
 It's the third eye vision, five side dimension 
 The 8th Light, is gonna shine bright tonight 
 It's the third eye vision, five side dimension 
 Equalin' up to eight, light sh"
2,Black Star,hiphop,Definition,"Hello everybody! 
 Recording live from somewhere... 
 (Mos Def) 
 Lawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwd, lawd have mercy 
 All nice and peace and true, follow me now, we say 
 Say Hi-Tek yes you're ruling hip-hop 
 Say J. Rawls yes you're ruling hip-hop 
 Redefinition say you're ruling hip-hop 
 Say Black Star come to rock it non... 
 Yo, from the first to the last of it, delivery is passionate 
 The whole and not the half of it, vocab and not the math of it 
 Projectile that them blasted with, accurate assassin shit 
 Me and Kweli close like, Bethlehem and Nazareth 
 After this you be pressing rewind on top your master disk 
 Shining like an asterisk for all those that be gatherin 
 Connectin like a roundhouse from the townhouse to the tenaments 
 Cause all my Brooklyn residents, are the heavy regiments 
 Don't believe, here the evidence, where Brooklyn WHAAAAAAAooh 
 See that? Bound to take it all kid, believe that 
 From where they sellin tree at, to where the police be at 
 Talib Kweli e-Kweli-ty yo tell them where we be at 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 Brooklyn New York City where they paint murals of Biggie 
 In cash we trust 'cause it's ghetto fabulous, life look pretty 
 What a pity -- blunts is still fifty cents, it's intense 
 Tree scents is dominant can't be covered with incense 
 My presence felt my name is Kweli from the Eternal Reflection 
 People thinkin' MC is short hand for Mis Conception 
 Let me meditate, set it straight, came to the conclusion 
 That most of these cats is featherweight, let me demonstrate 
 Walkin' the streets is like battlin, be careful with your body 
 You must know karate or think your soul is bulletproof like Sade 
 Stop actin' like a bitch already, be a visionary 
 And maybe you can see your name in the column of obituary 
 Third rate teacher readin and talkin' about, ""I knew he'd amount to nothin"", 
 Neighbors like, ""He was the quiet type, who'd have thought they was frontin?"" 
 Talkin' +Loud+ like you in RCA, get carted away 
 With body parts and trays, what a way to start your day 
 Yo it's like 
 Chorus: Mos Def and Talib Kweli 
 One two three 
 Mos Def and Talib Kweli 
 We came to rock it on to the tip-top 
 Best alliance in hip-hop, wyah 
 I said one two three 
 It's kind of dangerous to be a emcee 
 They shot Tupac and Biggie 
 Too much violence in hip-hop, wyah 
 (Mos Def) 
 I said Manhattan keep on makin' it (Bo!), Brooklyn keep on takin' it (Bo!) 
 So relax we're takin' it back, Redhook where we're livin' at 
 Plenty cats be strugglin not hustlin and bubblin 
 It ain't about production and -- what else we discussin? 
 When the cock crows, my crop grows, enable me to rock flows 
 Strivin for perfection ever since I was a snot-nose 
 Colossal, true original b-boy apostle 
 Standin on the rooftop with the Zulu gestapo 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 You think you the shit somebody in the wings'll force you to quit 
 It could be your crew or click or some random kid you smoked buddha with 
 Consider me the entity within the industry without a history 
 Of spittin' the epitome of stupidity 
 Livin' my life expressin my liberty, it gotta be done properly 
 My name is in the middle of e-Kweli-ty 
 People follow me and other cats they hear him flow 
 And assume I'm the real one with lyrics like I'm Cyrano 
 (Mos Def) 
 Still sippin wishin well water, imported from Pluto 
 Three hundred and sixty milliliters for all our believers 
 In miles or kilometers, most cats cannot proceed us 
 In the jungle with the leaders we the lions you the cheetahs 
 A cypher will complete us if we come through your receivers 
 You can play us and repeat us and then take us home and read us 
 (Line for line) Good Jesus, Mos Def and Kweli just 
 Make a pussy freeze up, thinkin' we will ease up 
 ...Hold Your head when the beat drop..."
3,Black Star,hiphop,RE,"What what what, what what, what what, what what 
 Whoa! 
 One two three, Mos Def and Talib Kweli 
 We came to rock it on to the tip-top 
 Best alliance in hip-hop, wayoh 
 I said, one two tree, Black Star shine eternally 
 We came to rock it on to the tip-top 
 And Hi-Tek make the beat drop, wayoh 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 RE:DEFinition, turning your play into a tragedy 
 Exhibit level degree on the mic, passionately 
 Niggaz is sweet so I bet if I bit I'd get a cavity 
 Livin' to get high, you ain't flyer than gravity 
 We Die Hard like the battery done in the back of me by the mad MC 
 Who think imitation is the highest form of flattery, actually 
 Don't be mad at me, I had to be the one to break it to you 
 You get kicked into obscurity like judo, no Menudo 
 Cause you pseudo, tryin' to compete with reality like Xerox 
 Towards destruction you spiraling like hairlocks, wipe them teardrops 
 Chasing stars in your eyes, playing games with your lives 
 Now the wives is widows soakin up pillows, weepin like willows 
 Still mo' blacks is dyin', kids ain't livin' they tryin' 
 _How to Make a Slave_ by Willie Lynch is still applyin 
 Regardless, the Mos is one of my closest partners 
 Rockin' ever since before Prince was called The Artist 
 Rocker before Funkmaster Flex was rockin' Starter 
 When 'Pac and Biggie was still cool before they was martyrs 
 Life or death, if I'm choosin' with every breath I'm enhancin 
 Stop, there comes a time when you can't run 
 (Mos Def) 
 What, lyrically handsome, call collect a king's ransom 
 Jams I write soon become the ghetto anthem 
 Way out like Bruce Wayne's mansion, move like a phantom 
 You'll talk about me to your grandsons 
 Cats who claimin they hard be mad fag 
 So I run through 'em like, flood water through sandbags 
 Competition is mad, what I got, they can't have 
 Sinkin they ship, like Moby Dick, did Ahab 
 Son I'm way past the minimum, it's a verb millennium 
 My rap's the holy gas in your bag, like Palestinians 
 Ancient Abyssinia, sure to hold the Gideon 
 Official b-boy gentlemen, long term, never the interim 
 Born inside the winter wind, day after December 10 
 These simpletons they mentionin the synonym for feminine 
 Sweeter than some cinnamon from Danish rings by Entenmann's 
 Rush up on adrenaline, they get they asses sent to them 
 (Gentlemen) you got a tenement, well then assemble it! 
 Leave your unit tremblin like herds of movin elephant 
 Intelligent embellishment, follow for your element 
 From Flatbush settlement, kid possesses melanin 
 Hotter than tales of crack peddlin, makin' 'em WOOP 
 Like blue gelatin, swing like Duke Ellington 
 Broader than Barrington Levy, believe me 
 The hot Apache who burn down your chief teepee 
 You see me? 
 One two three, Mos Def and Talib Kweli 
 We came to rock it on to the tip-top 
 Best alliance in hip-hop, wayoh 
 I said, one two tree, Black Star shine eternally 
 We came to rock it on to the tip-top 
 Because we rulin hip-hop, yes we is rulin hip-hop 
 Talib Kweli is rulin hip-hop 
 Say we Black Star we rule hip-hop-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah 
 Whoa!"
4,Black Star,hiphop,Children's Story,"(Child #1) ...and then Jackie Chan just started kickin em 
 Like POW! POW! POW! 
 (Child #2) Whaaaaa??! 
 (Mos Def) All right y'all, all right y'all enough of that 
 It's time to go to bed y'all 
 Time to go to bed -- I don't wanna hear that 
 You know what time it is, you know what time it is 
 (Children) Uncle Mos? 
 (Mos Def) Yeeesss? 
 (Children) Would you read us a bedtime story please? 
 (Mos Def) Okay, okay. Y'all tucked in? 
 (Children) Yeessss... 
 (Mos Def) Heeeere we go... 
 Once upon a time not long ago 
 When people wore Adidas and lived life slow 
 When laws were stern and justice stood 
 And people was behavin' like hip-hop was good 
 There lived a little boy who was misled 
 By a little Sha-tan and this is what he said 
 ""Me and you kid we gonna make some cash, 
 Jackin' old beats and makin' the dash..."" 
 They jacked the beats, money came wit' ease 
 But son, he couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease 
 He jacked another and another, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder 
 Set some R & B over the track for 'Deep Cover' (187!) 
 The kid got wild startin' actin' erratic 
 He said ""Yo, that presidential I got ta have it..."" 
 With liquor in his belly son, he made up the track 
 But little did he know that his joints was wack 
 The shiny A & R said ""Great new hit G!"" 
 ""Whenever you need a loop, yo come get me..."" 
 The kid got amped and he starts to figure 
 ""I'm-a get dough like all-a these otha niggaz!"" 
 So, he's in the studio workin' 'round the clock 
 For pop radio, jacked the beat to 'Planet Rock' 
 Was out in the street when he met this sister 
 Who couldn't sing for shhhh but the mix wit' her sister 
 Hooked up the track and in excitation 
 He decided he'd head for the radio station 
 But (But!) he was runnin' and he made a left 
 Was skeezin' at top speed and ran into Mos Def 
 I slowed the young man down and I started: ""Yo money, 
 Yo, why you sellin' lies to our wives and children?"" 
 He ran upstairs up to the top floor 
 Opened up the door then guess what he saw? (Who?) 
 JANE the chickenhead radio host 
 Who be yappin' 'bout beef between east and west coast 
 He said ""This one's a bullet, you got ta give it run!"" 
 The chicken said ""Thanks."" and spanked it #1 
 He went outside, was gettin' props all over 
 Then he dipped into his ride, the 4-point Rover 
 Raced up the block doin' 83 
 Some cats with Hennessey saw him at a R-E-D 
 He winked his eye like his star status mattered 
 They rat-a-tat-tatted to make his blood splatter 
 ""You rockin' crazy ice and all you do is cling static 
 And rollin' down to Brooklyn late night is problematic..."" 
 His eyes was bloody red, he hung on every word they said 
 They told the kid ""Back down, that playa shit is dead."" 
 Deep in his heart, he knew he was gone 
 But he grabbed his 45 and decide to blaze on 
 Wit' shades on founded had him astounded an' 
 Before long, the young man got surrounded 
 Those grabbed the guns, so goes the glory 
 And that is the way I got ta end this story 
 He was out chasin' cream and the American dream 
 Tryin' to pretend the ends justify the means 
 This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh 
 It's just what comes to pass when you sell your ass 
 Life is more than what your hands can grasp 
 Good Night! 
 (Kids talking) 
 Knock 'em out the box Mos, knock 'em out Mos 
 Knock 'em out the box Mos, knock 'em out Mos (3x) 
 Knock 'em out... 
 A-nother... Mos Def... Black Star MOVEMENT... 
 Presentation... CRUUUMBS!"

7,Black Star,hiphop,K.O.S. (Determination),"(Talib Kweli) 
 So many emcees focusin' on black people extermination 
 We keep it balanced with that knowledge of self, determination 
 It's hot, we be blowin' the spots, with conversations 
 C'mon let's smooth it out like Soul Sensation 
 We in the house like Japanese in Japan, or Koreans in Korea 
 Head to Philly and free Mumia with the Kujichagulia TRUE 
 Singin' is swingin' and writin' is fightin', but what 
 They writin' got us clashin' like titans it's not excitin' 
 No question, bein' a black man is demandin' 
 The fire's in my eyes and the flames need fannin' 
 The fire's in my eyes and the flames need fannin' 
 The fire's in my eyes and the flames need fannin' 
 With that what? (Knowledge Of Self) Determination 
 With that what? (Knowledge Of Self) Determination 
 With that what? (Knowledge Of Self) Determination 
 With that what? (Knowledge Of Self) Determination 
 (Vinia Mojica) 
 Things I say and do, may not come quite through 
 My words may not convey just what I'm feelin' 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 Yes yes come on, yes yes 
 Knowledge Of Self is like life after death 
 With that you never worry about your last breath 
 Death comes, that's how I'm livin', it's the next days 
 The flesh goes underground, the book of life, flip the page 
 Yo they askin' me how old, we livin' the same age 
 I feel the rage of a million niggaz locked inside a cage 
 At exactly which point do you start to realize 
 That life without knowledge is, death in disguise? 
 That's why, Knowledge Of Self is like life after death 
 Apply it, to your life, let destiny manifest 
 Different day, same confusion, we're gonna take this 
 Hip-hop shit and keep it movin', shed a little light 
 Now y'all bloomin' like a flower with the power of the evident 
 Voices and drums original instruments 
 In the flesh presently presentin' my representation 
 With that what? (Knowledge Of Self) Determination 
 With that what? (Knowledge Of Self) Determination 
 With that what? (Knowledge Of Self) Determination 
 With that what? (Knowledge Of Self) Determination 
 With that what? (Knowledge Of Self) Determination 
 With that what? (Knowledge Of Self) Determination 
 (Vinia Mojica - these parts overlap) 
 Things I say and do, may not come quite through 
 My words may not convey just what I'm feelin' 
 My words may not convey just what I'm feelin' 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 The most important time in history is, NOW, the present 
 So count your blessings cause time can't define the essence 
 But you stressin' over time and you follow the Roman calendar 
 These people into cloning, like Gattaca, you can bet 
 They tryin' to lock you down like Attica, the African diaspora 
 Represents strength in numbers, a giant can't slumber forever 
 I know you gotta get that cheddar whatever 
 Aiyyo I heard you twice the first time money, get it together 
 You must be History, you repeatin' yourself out of the pages 
 You keepin' yourself depleatin' your spiritual wealth 
 That quick cash'll get your ass quick fast in houses of detention 
 Inner-city concentration camps where no one pays attention 
 Or mentions the ascension of death, till nothing's left 
 The young, gifted and Black are sprung addicted to crack 
 All my people where y'all at cause, y'all ain't here 
 And your hero's using your mind as a canvas to paint fear 
 With, broad brush strokes and tales of incarceration 
 You get out of jail with that Knowledge of Self determination 
 Stand in ovation, cause you put the Hue in Human 
 Cause and effect, effect everything you do 
 And that's why I got love in the face of hate 
 Hands steady so the lines in the mental illustration is straight 
 The thought you had don't even contemplate 
 Infinite like figure eight there's no escape... 
 From that what? (Knowledge Of Self) Determination 
 From that what? (Knowledge Of Self) Determination 
 From that what? (Knowledge Of Self) Determination 
 From that what? (Knowledge Of Self) Determination

 Things I say and do, may not come quite through

 Yes... 
 Every day somebody ask me where all the real MC's is at? 
 They underground 
 There's mad talented cats underground with that raw shit 
 Yaknowwhat'msayin? Bringin' them raw skills 
 YaknowwhatI'm sayin'? 
 Really, to me... 
 It's a Small Wonder, like Vicki, why I'm picky 
 These niggas suck like hickies 
 And still get the shit they slip in like Mickies 
 I'm sick of the hater-players, bring on the regulators 
 With the flavors like a farm team fucking with the majors 
 Like a river how I run through it, I do it so cold 
 Freezin up your bodily fluids, your style is old 
 You runnin' your mouth, but don't really know what you be talkin' about 
 You should retire, get that complimentary watch, be out! 
 Yo, with the quickness, so swift you miss this lyrical fitness 
 Now get this, these emcees wanna test me like litmus, bear witness 
 I'm like shot clocks, interstate cops, and blood clots 
 My point is, your flow can stop! 
 By all means, you need more practice, take that ass home 
 Everybody lookin' at you, fish tank syndrome 
 In full effect, I stay catchin lyrical rep 
 And keep it blacker than the back of your neck 
 What you expect, that shit's hollerin 
 'Cause we developin the followin 
 Gettin' played like stone love tapes and dollar vans 
 Order reverse your universe so your demise is first 
 Before your rise it gets worse 
 You need a night nurse like Gregory 
 Beggin me - stop it hurts! - is what you say to me 
 Like that's supposed to mean somethin'? 
 You the one I seen frontin in the club 
 Your act I don't buy it, I got the dub 
 Come on everybody, come on just show your love 
 Come on everybody, come on just show your love 
 Come on everybody, come on just show your love 
 Come on everybody, come on just show your love 
 Come on everybody, come on just show your love

 (Mos Def) 
 Visions occupy my synaptic space 
 Command and shake, to illustrate my mind's landscape 
 The tall grass, the low plains, the mountanous ridges 
 Thickets among the forests, rivers beneath the bridges 
 Presence of hilltops, lit up with tree tops 
 Eavesdrop; and hear the incline of sunshine, nine 
 Stones in orbit, refuse to forfeit 
 They all form a cipher, and they came to observe it 
 I follow suit, and face it, embrace it 
 Shinin bright, but still I'm careful not to waste it 
 Destined to rise, because I'm basement adjacent 
 Spirit is still so just chill and be patient 
 Some heads approach like I'm the one to base with 
 Clowns about to scream and shout but don't say shh... 
 I ain't your student so I ain't to be tested 
 I'm majestic, I represent my strength without effort 
 My, method is unorthodox, but of course it rocks 
 My serious synopsis will drop kick, my topics 
 Run the gauntlets and galvanize the audience 
 I must represent, I don't come off with no corniness 
 It's all luminary, despite commentary 
 Some people say, Mos how you get so? 
 My sign will make you jump around like calypso 
 And, murmur to yourself like a schizo 
 There ain't no bottom on the ??? 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 Come on, come on, come on, come on 
 Here we go. Blackstar, hop on the Blackstar line 
 We bout to take y'all home. 
 YaknowwhatImean? Here we go... 
 We got all markets on lock 
 From meat to stock 
 Blackstar, what? throwin' like head rock in bars 
 Men flock to where we are, 'cause it's the place to be 
 Grab my paint, jump on stage and deface emcees 
 We sell our souls like Spawn and come for the drone I sit upon 
 Freestyle or written songs so we can get it on! 
 Going back and forth, fallin' back, all across the track 
 Passin the mic's like quarterbacks 
 Of course its phat, get off of that! 
 Reverse psychology got 'em scared to say when shit is whack 
 Out of fear of being called a hater, imagine that! 
 We ain't havin' that reachin' past the star status that you grabbin at 
 My battle raps blast your ass back to your natural habitat 
 So floss, 'cause what it costs ain't worth it to me 
 'Cause I'm the one these Spice Girl emcees Wannabe 
 But they can't, ain't no points forever, so why bother? 
 Cause your girl calls my name out like Clarence Carter 
 Clarence Carter, Clarence Carter! 
 (I be strokin, that's what I be doin') 
 Aiyyo, as we rock harder 
 And always drop the bonified head nodders 
 Aiyyo, later for the hater-players 
 Yo-yo, yo-yo, later for these hater-players

 That was when some of them bad niggas made beauty moving juju changes the drum 
 Music hum! Mojo vibrated and high jons screamed through the bloods to no one 
 Hears the blood sounds no more folk intercourses and all the niggas listening 
 Acted visionaries too dig my people they acted the ryhtms pulling there minds 
 Was one and move move move universe earth spirit firing the soils to destroy 
 The evil un image cleanse the waste from the cold lands till the cosmos was 
 Whole again and the worlds had become nude 
 (Older man) 
 3:30 in the morning with not a sole in sight we sat four deep at a traffic light 
 Talking about how dumb and brainwashed how dumb some of our brothers and

 The new moon rode high in the crown of the metropolis 
 Shinin', like who on top of this? 
 People was tusslin', arguin' and bustlin' 
 Gangstas of Gotham hardcore hustlin' 
 I'm wrestlin' with words and ideas 
 My ears is picky, seekin' what will transmit 
 The scribes can apply to transcript, yo 
 This ain't no time where the usual is suitable 
 Tonight alive, let's describe the inscrutable 
 The indisputable, we New York the narcotic 
 Strength in metal and fiber optics 
 Where mercenaries is paid to trade hot stock tips 
 For profits, thirsty criminals take pockets 
 Hard knuckles on the second hands of workin' class watches 
 Skyscrapers is colossus, the cost of living 
 Is preposterous, stay alive, you play or die, no options 
 No Batman and Robin, can't tell between 
 The cops and the robbers, they both partners, they all heartless 
 With no conscience, back streets stay darkened 
 Where unbeliever hearts stay hardened 
 My eagle talons stay sharpened, like city lights stay throbbin' 
 You either make a way or stay sobbin', the shiny apple 
 Is bruised but sweet and if you choose to eat 
 You could lose your teeth, many crews retreat 
 Nightly news repeat, who got shot down and locked down 
 Spotlight to savages, Nasdaq averages 
 My narrative, rose to explain this existence 
 Amidst the harbor lights which remain in the distance 
 So much on my mind that I can't recline 
 Blastin' holes in the night till she bled sunshine 
 Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine 
 Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline 
 Heard the bass ride out like an ancient mating call 
 I can't take it y'all, I can feel the city breathin' 
 Chest heavin', against the flesh of the evening 
 Sigh before we die like the last train leaving 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 Breathin' in deep city breaths, sittin' on shitty steps 
 We stoop to new lows, hell froze the night the city slept 
 The beast crept through concrete jungles 
 Communicatin' with one another 
 And ghetto birds where waters fall 
 From the hydrants to the gutters 
 The beast walk the beats, but the beats we be makin' 
 You on the wrong side of the track, lookin' visibly shaken 
 Taken them plungers, plungin' to death that's painted by the numbers 
 With crime unapplied pressure, cats is playin' god 
 But havin' children by a lesser baby mother but fuck it 
 We played against each other like puppets, swearin' you got pull 
 When the only pull you got is the wool over your eyes 
 Gettin' knowledge in jail like a blessing in disguise 
 Look in the skies for god, what you see besides the smog 
 Is broken dreams flying away on the wings of the obscene 
 Thoughts that people put in the air 
 Places where you could get murdered over a glare 
 But everything is fair 
 It's a paradox we call reality 
 So keepin' it real will make you casualty of abnormal normality 
 Killers born naturally like, Mickey and Mallory 
 Not knowing the ways'll get you capped like an NBA salary 
 Some cats be emceeing to illustrate what we be seeing 
 Hard to be a spiritual being when shit is shakin' what you believe in 
 For trees to grow in Brooklyn, seeds need to be planted 
 I'm asking if y'all feel me and the crowd left me stranded 
 My blood pressure boiled and rose, cause New York niggas 
 Actin' spoiled at shows, to the winners the spoils go 
 I take the L, transfer to the 2, head to the gates 
 New York life type trife the Roman Empire State 
 (Mos def and crew) 
 So much on my mind I just can't recline 
 Blastin' holes in the night till she bled sunshine 
 Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine 
 Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline

 I can't take it y'all, I can feel the city breathin' 
 Chest heavin', against the flesh of the evening 
 Sigh before we die like the last train leaving

 (Common) 
 Yo... on the amen, corner I stood lookin' at my former hood 
 Felt the spirit in the wind, knew my friend was gone for good 
 Threw dirt on the casket, the hurt, I couldn't mask it 
 Mixin' down emotions, struggle I hadn't mastered 
 I choreograph seven steps to heaven 
 And hell, waiting to exhale and make the bread leavened 
 Veteran of a cold war its chica-i-go for 
 What I know or, what's known 
 So some days I take the bus home, just to touch home 
 From the crib I spend months gone 
 Sat by the window with a clutched dome listenin' to shorties cuss long 
 Young girls with weak minds, but they butt strong 
 Tried to call, or at least beep the lord, but didn't have a touch-tone 
 It's a dog-eat-dog world, you gotta mush on 
 Some of this land I must own 
 Outta the city, they want us gone 
 Tearin' down the jects creatin' plush homes 
 My circumstance is between Cabrini and Love Jones 
 Surrounded by hate, yet I love home 
 Ask my God how he thought travellin' the world sound 
 Found it hard to imagine he hadn't been past downtown 
 Its deep, I heard the city breathe in its sleep 
 Of reality I touch, but for me its hard to keep 
 Deep, I heard my man breathe in his sleep 
 Of reality I touch, but for me its hard to keep 
 (Mos def and crew) 
 So much on my mind I just can't recline 
 Blastin' holes in the night till she bled sunshine 
 Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine 
 Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline 
 Yo how the bass ride out like an ancient mating call 
 I can't take it y'all, I can feel the city breathing 
 Chest heavin', against the flesh of the evening 
 Kiss the ides goodbye, I'm on the last train leaving"

 Yo Dee (What?) 
 Come on (Yeah..) 
 What? What? Come on 
 (Yeah) 
 ""Give me the fortune, keep the fame,"" said my man Louis 
 I agreed, know what he mean because we live the truest lie 
 I asked him why we follow the law of the bluest eye 
 He looked at me, he thought about it 
 Was like, ""I'm clueless, why?"" 
 The question was rhetorical, the answer is horrible 
 Our morals are out of place and got our lives full of sorrow 
 And so tomorrow comin' later than usual 
 Waitin' on someone to pity us 
 While we findin' beauty in the hideous 
 They say money's the root of all evil but I can't tell 
 You know what I mean, pesos, francs, yens, cowrie shells, dollar bills 
 Or is it the mindstate that's ill? 
 Creating crime rates to fill the new prisons they build 
 Over money and religion there's more blood to spill 
 The wounds of slaves in cotton fields that never heal 
 What's the deal? 
 A lot of cats who buy records are straight broke 
 But my language universal they be recitin' my quotes 
 While R&B singers hit bad notes, we rock the boat 
 Of thought, that my man Louis' statements just provoked 
 Caught up, in conversations of our personal worth 
 Brought up, through endangered species status on the planet Earth 
 Survival tactics means, bustin' gats to prove you hard 
 Your firearms are too short to box with God 
 Without faith, all of that is illusionary 
 Raise my son, no vindication of manhood necessary 
 [M.D.] Not strong 
 [T.K.] Only aggressive

 Yo, I'm sure that everybody out listenin' agree 
 That everything you see ain't really how it be 
 A lot of jokers out runnin' in place, chasin the style 
 Be a lot goin' on beneath the empty smile 
 Most cats in my area be lovin' the hysteria 
 Synthesized surface conceals the interior 
 America, land of opportunity, mirages and camouflages 
 More than usually -- speakin' loudly, sayin' nothin' 
 You confusin' me, you losin' me 
 Your game is twisted, want me enlisted -- in your usary 
 Foolishly, most men join the ranks cluelessly 
 Buffoonishly accept the deception, believe the perception 
 Reflection rarely seen across the surface of the lookin' glass 
 Walkin' the street, wonderin' who they be lookin' past 
 Lookin' gassed with them imported designer shades on 
 Stars shine bright, but the light -- rarely stays on 
 Same song, just remixed, different arrangement 
 Put you on a yacht but they won't call it a slave ship 
 Strangeness, you don't control this, you barely hold this 
 Screamin' brand new, when they just sanitized the old shit 
 Suppose it's, just another clever Jedi mind trick 
 That they been runnin' across stars through all the time with 
 I find it's distressin', there's never no in-between 
 We either niggaz or Kings 
 We either bitches or Queens 
 The deadly ritual seems immersed, in the perverse 
 Full of short attention spans, short tempers, and short skirts 
 Long barrel automatics released in short bursts 
 The length of black life is treated with short worth 
 Get yours first, them other niggaz secondary 
 That type of illin' that be fillin' up the cemetery 
 This life is temporary but the soul is eternal 
 Separate the real from the lie, let me learn you 
 Not strong, only aggressive, cause the power ain't directed 
 That's why, we are subjected to the will of the oppressive 
 Not free, we only licensed 
 Not live, we just excitin' 
 Cause the captors... own the masters... to what we writin' 
 Not compassionate, only polite, we well trained 
 Our sincerity's rehearsed in stage, it's just a game 
 Not good, but well behaved cause the ca-me-ra survey 
 Most of the things that we think, do, or say 
 We chasin' after death just to call ourselves brave 
 But everyday, next man meet with the grave 
 I give a damn if any fan recall my legacy 
 I'm tryin' to live life in the sight of God's memory 
 Like that y'all

 Gas plays like petroleum, walk over them like linoleum 
 My vocab expand like a rubber band 
 Walkin' nekkid through the motherland, give the finger to my brotherman 
 Niggaz just don't understand my reasons, I transcend like season 
 And scar these rappers like legion 
 It's treason, my suspension attract attention 
 I'm ventin', givin' these chickenheads detention 
 Did I mention my name, yo, go by the Jane Doe 
 Drenched in Polo, chill downtown in Soho 
 You don't know, this is just half my potential 
 Check my credentials, come harder than sequential 
 It's essential, you listen, I drive, you a pedestrian 
 They bless me on the track 'cause I attack wit' the estrogen 
 Rhyme against the best a men, Jane burn it up 
 When you hear it in the whip, tell your man to turn it up!

 Yo... get it... yo 
 Yo, we fortified live, supportin' allies 
 The wack is tryin' to shorten our lives, it sorta waters my eyes 
 But here is some'n the cryin' talk about 
 The verse on that cassette you and cousin fought about 
 That led to God and Satan's fallin' out 
 Encourage the liquor for those who ain't here that you pourin' out 
 On 3-way, your parents, preacher and spouse called my house 
 Revive or ruin, my theories of mics 
 Sony or Aiwa, black or white, I fit in all stereotypes 
 Search for a cast to plot, I make you a laughin' stock 
 So shook, I could walk a half a block and feel the aftershocks 
 Rain of acid drops, seek some help 
 Now don't rewind, get it the first time 
 Shouldn't have to repeat myself 
 Eternally verbally, I have numbers, succumb to time outs 
 In rhyme bouts you'll dial 9, just to get a line out 
 Known fact or factors and non-rappers fractured 
 Results in more cast appearances than a hundred actors 
 Emcees I'm testin' like diseases injected in gerbils 
 Wordsworth, Kweli, Hi-Tek, Reflection Eternal... what... 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 My style highlights like fonts when I burn heads like a conk 
 Cause niggas front, when their chances get slim like Pharoahe Monch 
 Thinkin' they shits is heavy when they light like illumination 
 Intellectual masturbation with premature ejaculation 
 I'm comin' cleaner than vaccinations 
 My fascination with character assassination 
 Got these niggas burnin' like sensation 
 We keep it hot like matches and on lock like latches 
 Wack emcees get they microphones snatched like Lee patches 
 So YOU GO! To every wack muthafucka that you know (Scram...) 
 My lyrics they get up in your jeans like Parasucos 
 So there's no mystery about the father, niggas is hot and bothered 
 Like the bitches that they are, takin' pictures with stars 
 And got 'em open, but after they little hopes and dreams get broken 
 Me and Hi-Tek, we live long and prosper like Vulcans 
 Think I'm jokin'? We both got sons, we make cream and break dreams 
 See through the fake schemes, wipin' your slate clean 
 Like a squeegee, we be lightin' shit up like phosphorus 
 Turnin' flamboyant niggas anonymous, depressin' to optimist 
 You stoppin' us is preposterous, like an androgynous misogynist 
 You pickin' the wrong time, steppin' to me when I'm in my prime like Optimus 
 Transformin', from rookie of the year to veteran 
 Hip-hop is big business like Con Edison or medicine 
 But fuck it, they gonna let us in, or else we rush the door 
 I got too many reasons, save your 'whys' and 'what fors'

 Get deep like Islamics wrapped in a white garment

 Vacate in the Tropics, you dodgin' bullets in the projects 
 Cut the nonsense, I'm hotter than a lot of men 
 Start honorin', got more wifeys than Solomon 
 Fuck the squad you in, a-yo we be the biddomb 
 Regardless what I spit on, you worse with the tracks I shit on 
 Once you get on, it's fair you can't trust (Yes!) 
 Words and Punch, make rappers march like the third month 
 I build with friends, lyrically spit gems 
 Call me diamond, 'cause I'm your girl's best friend 
 Emcees are born losers, alcoholic abusers 
 I'll go on the radio and start a gay rumor 
 And then I'll talk about how the crowd tried to boo ya 
 Label shoot ya, stressed out with brain tumors 
 My gat claps, 50% of the wack 
 Take it back to real rap, Krylons wit' the fat cap 
 Get robbed for your ASCAP, leave you inside 
 Fortified live, reppin' NY till I die!

 The purpose is, make you go and purchase this, no nervousness 
 We are, hot like black tar, Black Star with emergence 
 Superlative, you fabricated like the word absurditive 
 I'm rockin' this from here to where the Persians live 
 To Brooklyn where the merchants live 
 Next door to the murderers 
 And bourbon is a elder man's medicinal alternative 
 My memory is furnished with, back streets to back seats to fat Jeeps 
 Legendary athletes who play by the trash heap 
 My crew wasn't that deep, but beef we didn't act sweet 
 Treadin' on these stompin' grounds you better catch some black feet 
 Flashy, it was between DeKalb and Pulasky 
 Off the meter like an out of borough taxi 
 They run your pockets fastly, black and nasty, nappy and crafty 
 That's why they're either sittin' in Clinton or Coxsackie 
 Mayor Rudolph can screw off! You too soft to stop us 
 You and your coppers should see some foot doctors 
 Got your bird chest popped up, but keep your guns cocked up 
 'Cause all them cats that you knocked up ain't always gon' be locked up 
 Hot stuff like Donna Summer, another number one-r 
 And comin' from the underground, this is how it's comin' down

 Check the keys that get played on the roads of life 
 Yo the rhyme is so heavy like a load of my chest 
 Travel on these MC's, leave 'em broken like house pets 
 Priceless like the streets I'm on, my word is born 
 You like Paula Abdul-ka-ka compared to Sarah Born? 
 Sayin', what did I do to be so black and blue 
 MC's sayin' damn what got it goin' after you 
 Slam my microphone and do just what I have to do

 You know I'd like to stop and chat but I'm just passing through

 Inside Brooklyn the b-boy capital, lot of cats travel to black eratical 
 Say, my response is invatically yes 
 We invatically fresh, you dramatically stressed 
 These MC's proceed to cease the presidential palace 
 And burn Babylon like a? 
 Strive to maintain balance 
 With the God given talent 
 Articulate the article, eliminate the fossical 
 Black Star Line shine remarkable, they style ain't even talkable 
 These socalled criminals is fictional they make the party turn miserable 
 We document the memorable 
 Then break 'em up like syllables 
 Straight down to earth like minerals

 You can't handle this Messiah 
 My shit is classical we get bug' like Umfufu, ""You treat me like animal!""

 Just 'cause you make it don't give you the right to be a?

 Then get missin' with Hi-Tech or anyone like that 
 Costin' one million pounds 'cause it sound so fat 
 Lay you flat like the carpet 
 Take the tobacco out my spliff before you spark it 
 The only tye I rock is chocolate 
 Makin' profits like Spacely Sprockets, you can't stop it 
 The topic, we always gonna be black like markets 
 From the underground, look around and tell me what you see 
 Another picture painted perfectly by yours truly 
 Another world, y'all

 The solo's ? chrome is known to built on 
 Gleam on the measurement

 Ain't takin' or breakin', robbery 
 Got the whole owner blast-back policy 
 Follow me, descendant of the grand master armery 
 Where cats rock the Wallabe and Kangols, MC's exchange flows 
 The same goes on, they'll be here when we gone 
 Hope they heart stay strong for

 Yo Dee (What?) 
 Come on (Yeah..) 
 What? What? Come on 
 (Yeah) 
 ""Give me the fortune, keep the fame,"" said my man Louis 
 I agreed, know what he mean because we live the truest lie 
 I asked him why we follow the law of the bluest eye 
 He looked at me, he thought about it 
 Was like, ""I'm clueless, why?"" 
 The question was rhetorical, the answer is horrible 
 Our morals are out of place and got our lives full of sorrow 
 And so tomorrow comin' later than usual 
 Waitin' on someone to pity us 
 While we findin beauty in the hideous 
 They say money's the root of all evil but I can't tell 
 YouknowhatImean, pesos, francs, yens, cowrie shells, dollar bills 
 Or is it the mindstate that's ill? 
 Creating crime rates to fill the new prisons they build 
 Over money and religion there's more blood to spill 
 The wounds of slaves in cotton fields that never heal 
 What's the deal? 
 A lot of cats who buy records are straight broke 
 But my language universal they be recitin my quotes 
 While R&B singers hit bad notes, we rock the boat 
 Of thought, that my man Louis' statements just provoked 
 Caught up, in conversations of our personal worth 
 Brought up, through endangered species status on the planet Earth 
 Survival tactics means, bustin' gats to prove you hard 
 Your firearms are too short to box with God 
 Without faith, all of that is illusionary 
 Raise my son, no vindication of manhood necessary 
 (M.D.) Not strong 
 (T.K.) Only aggressive 
 (M.D.) Not free 
 (T.K.) We only licensed

 (Mos Def) 
 Yo, I'm sure that everbody out listenin agree 
 That everything you see ain't really how it be 
 A lot of jokers out runnin' in place, chasin the style 
 Be a lot goin' on beneath the empty smile 
 Most cats in my area be lovin' the hysteria 
 Synthesized surface conceals the interior 
 America, land of opportunity, mirages and camoflauges 
 More than usually -- speakin' loudly, sayin' nothin' 
 You confusin me, you losin me 
 Your game is twisted, want me enlisted -- in your usary 
 Foolishly, most men join the ranks cluelessly 
 Buffoonishly accept the deception, believe the perception 
 Reflection rarely seen across the surface of the lookin' glass 
 Walkin' the street, wonderin who they be lookin' past 
 Lookin' gassed with them imported designer shades on 
 Stars shine bright, but the light -- rarely stays on 
 Same song, just remixed, different arrangement 
 Put you on a yacht but they won't call it a slaveship 
 Strangeness, you don't control this, you barely hold this 
 Screamin brand new, when they just sanitized the old shit 
 Suppose it's, just another clever Jedi mind trick 
 That they been runnin' across stars through all the time with 
 I find it's distressin, there's never no in-between 
 We either niggaz or Kings 
 We either bitches or Queens 
 The deadly ritual seems immersed, in the perverse 
 Full of short attention spans, short tempers, and short skirts 
 Long barrel automatics released in short bursts 
 The length of black life is treated with short worth 
 Get yours first, them other niggaz secondary 
 That type of illin that be fillin up the cemetery 
 This life is temporary but the soul is eternal 
 Separate the real from the lie, let me learn you 
 Not strong, only aggressive, cause the power ain't directed 
 That's why, we are subjected to the will of the oppressive 
 Not free, we only licensed 
 Not live, we just excitin 
 Cause the captors... own the masters... to what we writin 
 Not compassionate, only polite, we well trained 
 Our sincerity's rehearsed in stage, it's just a game 
 Not good, but well behaved cause the ca-me-ra survey 
 Most of the things that we think, do, or say 
 We chasin after death just to call ourselves brave 
 But everyday, next man meet with the grave 
 I give a damn if any fam' recall my legacy 
 I'm tryin' to live life in the sight of God's memory 
 Like that y'all

 A lot of people don't understand the true criteria of things 
 Can't just accept the appearance 
 Have to get the true essence

 We rep the ain't-gots 
 Ain't nobody can't start no party like us, we crush the faint hearts 
 From Hallsey to St. Mark's, walk in the main blocks 
 Painted with blood that's still hot, so deep it stain socks 
 The pain spark frustration, situations lead to hatin' 
 Some deal with drug distribution, others walk the plantation 
 Some know the code a' the streets, some got a college education 
 Come down on the weekend, and peep the conversation 
 (Mos) 
 Yo 
 On the corner, units stormed out 
 Ghetto lookin' bombed out 
 Police waited to roll, for those who walk the wrong route 
 Shorties goin' all out, they got they swords drawn out 
 Ready to brawl out, gettin' fought till they fall out 
 Black like Morehouse, 40 o'z is tossed out 
 For brothers that they mourn bout, get wrecked till it's dawn out 
 Whether they broke or flossed out, honeys pass they draws out 
 Lookin' for a ticket out the poor-house 
 A jungle out here 
 Lions keep they claws out, fangs and jaws out 
 Weak just get forced out 
 Names is called out, ghetto-fame is sought out 
 You wanna be the man that they talk bout 
 I walked out 
 I had some things on my mind to sort out 
 I thought 'bout the wild circumstance we born out 
 Remember myself at your age, when I was just like you 
 If that was now, I don't know what I would do 
 My answer's? closest to me 
 So what I say to you is goin' for me 
 Son we both still growin' indeed 
 But where you at, I was, and where you been, I left 
 Utilize my experience to guide your step 
 Some people get love but don't command respect 
 It's somethin' that you can't ride with a check 
 Over-rollin' your lex or icy links that hang from your neck 
 If it's real, who need to deal with the special effects?

 Come here, come here, yo 
 Lemme drop this on ya, look they gotchu cornered 
 The corner of the block is hot, I ain't got to warn ya 
 'Cause I see you every day, trapped in every way 
 'Shit, I'm a thug, and that's all that I can say' 
 Who are you anyway? 
 Mary J.? I spend, many nights awake, watchin you while you sleep 
 Tryin' to figure out how to be the example, 'cause talk is cheap 
 As you walk the streets, study cats on the real 
 In a convo, just make your point to relax and chill 
 (Niggas) wanna destroy each other in a cypher instead a' build 
 Be a- man of will, don't be- standin still 
 If you- don't plan ahead, then you- plan to fail 
 Do ? in a daze when the ways reveal 
 Like they funny style but I'm not laughin' 
 Serious (niggas) makin' money while the police is passin 
 Can't wait for opportunity to knock, you gotta make it happen 
 It ain't about no spectacular ways a' rappin' 
 Just immaculate ways a' action... dig?

 Sweeter than some cinnamon from Danish rings by Entenmann's 
 Rush up on adrenaline, they get they asses sent to them 
 Gentlemen you got a tenement, well then assemble it! 
 Leave your unit tremblin' like herds of movin' elephant 
 Intelligent embellishment, follow for your element 
 From Flatbush settlement, skin possesses melanin 
 Hotter than tales of crack peddlin', makin' 'em woop 
 Like blue gelatin, swing like Duke Ellington 
 Broader than Barrington Levy, believe me 
 The hot oppresion rent who burn down your chief tepee, you see me? 
 One two three, Mos Def and Talib Kweli 
 We came to rock it on to the tip-top 
 Best alliance in hip-hop, wayoh 
 I said, one two tree, Black Star shine eternally 
 We came to rock it on to the tip-top 
 Because we rulin' hip-hop, yes we is rulin' hip-hop 
 Talib Kweli is rulin' hip-hop 
 Say we Black Star we rule hip-hop, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, whoa"
20,Black Star,hiphop,Respiration (Flying High Mix),"(Mos Def singing) 
 I'm flyin' high, in the friendly sky 
 Without ever leaving the ground, yeah yeah 
 Rest of the folks are tired and weary 
 And have laid their bodies down 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 We lyrically rich, livin', spiritually fit 
 Eating healthy, coming clean never filthy 
 In God's eyes I'm wealthy 
 Felt the power as I entered the palace of 7 lights 
 Time traveled participatin on battles my brethren fight 
 For birth rights that they already got, and shouldn't have to get 
 Break down the steady plot that's accurate 
 Bust the shots that's immaculate 
 Take it to your nugget cause my beloved covet they freedom 
 Believe it put nothing above it love it or leave it 
 We blessed with free will so we choose to be ill 
 Like sharks keepin' it movin we could never be still 
 Swim in the channels of life 
 The orators of rhyme handling mics 
 Tiptoeing through the corridors of your mind with candlelights 
 Everlasting in your hood like liquor stores and check cashin 
 Niggaz flashing (?-) classes sippin thug passion blastin 
 Makaveli 4, I bet on brothers with nothing to live for 
 To give more to the struggle, they already at war 
 So much on my mind I just can't recline 
 Blastin holes till the night bled sunshine 
 Breathe in... 
 Breathe out, 
 Heard the bass ride out like an ancient (mating call) 
 I can't take it, I can feel the city breathing 
 (Mos Def) 
 Yo, 
 I pushed my pen and wrote this scribe 
 Like the morning wouldn't find me alive 
 I'm surrounded on all sides 
 By the kind and the cool, wise men and the fool 
 Young guns attending school, ghetto classes include: 
 Get yours, get it right 
 Get down, get paid, get ass, get around 
 Get on, get fly, get jig and get high 
 Live to get and you'll only end up getting by 
 When the nighttime covers the city like a cloak 
 I approach and assemble my hopes, into notes 
 Hard to sleep in the city that don't 
 Cause it won't let you rest, noises on your doorstep 
 'Nuff distress 
 Police department, raid the park bench on nonsense 
 'Cause they fear to see the brothers conference 
 Regardless, we bond tight and we rumble all day to break night 
 Daylight, wifey riffin' to death - ""you ain't right"" 
 The same fight about my late night habits is mad static 
 But the city's so alive that I just got to have it 
 The planet of Brook-LAWN is what I look on 
 Ghetto chef rock your vest when you gettin' your cook on 
 Dedicating this song to Scott LaRock, B.I.G. and 'Pac 
 Kwame Ture, Betty Carter and John Henrik CLark 
 Ron Brown, and freedom fighters going down 
 You set the pace, now we finish the race 
 It's on now 
 So much on my mind I just can't recline 
 Blasting holes till the night bled sunshine 
 Breathe in... 
 Breathe out, 
 Heard the bass ride out like an ancient (mating call) 
 I can't take it, I can feel the city breathing 
 (Black Thought) 
 Yo, Yo 
 I'm from the year-round shootouts to summertime cookout 
 The wintertime grind with the shorties on the lookout 
 A chosen few know the rule, the rest threw the book out 
 The law stay on crews, thirsty with they hook out 
 That old-school bang out, 
 Money that pulled the thang out 
 They bit him and hit him with a few, he just came out 
 With the sharks that travel all parts within the same route 
 Narrow walls closin in, cutthroat to exit at the opening 
 Wrong place, you wasn't where you were supposed to been 
 You back around the end, heavy wasteline again 
 With them same suspect cats that waste time again 
 Y'all need to wake the fuck up, and peep the monument in your face 
 'Cause ain't no time to waste not a minute 
 I seen my cousin (?-) said ""Peace, yo where you been at?"" 
 He said ""the final frontier 'Riq, I'm up in that, 
 And it's the time to watch the place your foe and where your friend at, 
 'Cause where I rotate ain't nothin' to grin at, I been at 
 The fork in the crossroads, the outer limit, 
 See you can stand tall or crawl and act timid"" 
 The Black Thought with the Black Star, infinite 
 (Chorus and ad libs to fade)"
21,Black Star,hiphop,Talkin To You,"(Mos Def: talking behind singing vocals) 
 It's always the nervous cats, that's like... 
 Yo money, you tryin' to dis me or something? 
 What you tryin' to get fly or something? 
 You tryin' to get a little rep off me or something, money? 
 Let me tell you something money, you don't know me like that 
 NawI'msayin, you don't know none of my crew like that 
 NawI'msayin, and if you really wanna make some little insinuation 
 About me nawI'msayin, don't talk about it, be about it money 
 If you wanna do something, we can do it right now 
 (Pharoahe Monch) 
 I levitate through meditation 
 Sitting my legs crossed, source to build force field 
 To shield my immediate surroundings 
 Avoiding falling sheet rock, rubble and granite 
 Expand, white man, got plans to feed the planet 
 Excessive hate, repercussions of manic-depressive state 
 Panic, God forbid we all take it for granted 
 Delivering lyrical thoughts for spiritual dividends 
 Half the concentrate, like Hampstead we'll be livin' in 
 Magnetic boring them, it's a must I score again 
 And pollute em, shoot 'em like white students in Oregon 
 'Cause when I was broke, I always found figures to fuck bitches 
 Wit full-force like them muscle-bound niggas 
 (Rah Digga) 
 Well it's the R-A-H, big up to Brick City 
 When I'm not rippin niggas I be ?feelin' wit committee? 
 Got two rap clicks, so bring all the kingred 
 Buggin off of rappers sayin' shit that I been said 
 Askin me how your mob sound, bringin' my high down 
 Flipmode put shit together quicker than a seamstress 
 Thinkin' I talk white 'cause I speak proper English 
 All up in your air like I was celly interference 
 Rip shows and make little cameo appearance 
 White label to death if I can't get no clearance 
 (Mos Def: talking behind vocals) 
 Alot of cats think I'm trapped in a box, livin' cruel and if that's true 
 I'm talkin' to you 
 Thinkin' of dissin your steez, your degress, everything you're attached to then 
 I'm talkin' to you 
 Wonderin who we talkin' about, yo is my name in his mouth, well then 
 I'm talkin' to you 
 No mystery, you ain't got to scratch your head 
 Like ""Is he dissin me?"", we talkin' to you 
 (A-Butta) 
 Aiyyo we severed the lever that I pull 
 It's never the bull, shit instead of the full clip, click 
 You get hit in the head wit dialect 
 When I pre-fect my new script 
 Check the architect then select the newest blueprint 
 When I pro-ject the move-meant of the mic, it might strike 
 And brand new life trife that handle 
 ?Flyin off?, literature that's pure 
 Yo we miniature before, you finished yours, I get mine 
 Musically inclined, like the sign of a clef 
 To my death, I rhyme and yes I left you, sense-less in the mind 
 Plus I'm, going to show no re-pentance 
 My flow's relentless, you know the sentence 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 You will respect it when we set it 
 Fake MC's get tossed 
 For leavin' the microphone covered wit the gloss 
 Don't get lost, bitch-asses who switch fastest 
 When my hits smashes, impacts like whip crashes 
 Fuckin' up your face like thick glasses 
 You still can't see shit 
 I'll snatch your faith, your imagination won't believe it 
 It's ill, you can't conceive it 
 Any nigga can make a baby, it takes a man to be a father 
 Why bother, you'll be run over in the street like Frogger 
 Comatose like Central Park joggers when my crew goes wildin 
 Lyricist who will never Lounge till all wack shit is silenced 
 I'm not violent, niggas come aggressive wit that nonsense 
 Yo, it's time for us to get aggressive wit our conscience 
 (Mos Def) 
 Alot of cats think I'm chattin about 
 Them and they crew, and if that's true 
 I'm talkin' to you 
 Wondering if I'm dissin you and everything you're attached to 
 I'm talkin' to you 
 Runnin' your mouth, wonderin ""yo, who Mos be talkin' bout?"" 
 I'm talkin' to you 
 No mystery, you can consider yourself dissed officially 
 You can consider yourself dissed officially 
 You can consider yourself dissed officially 
 (Ranting and shouting until end)"
22,Black Star,hiphop,What's Beef?,"spoken: 
 This is a real nigga P.S.A. from the Black Star embassy in Brooklyn entitled ""What Is Beef?"" 
 (Talib Kweli): 
 Yo, I was sold to a sick European by a rich African battling, 
 Middle passages, I can't go back again. 
 Battlin' years of denied history, lies and mysteries. 
 Wives with misty eyes watching they niggas be beaten viciously 
 Battling the wilderness of North America, 
 Ran by the river, only stopping to pray. Chased by predators: 
 Terrorists with etiquette, who vote and kill they president, 
 Their capacity for evil so evident and prevalent. 
 Ain't no hesitation involved, a nation dissolved, 
 While we sit back waitin' to evolve. 
 Those who'd trade they freedom for protection deserve neither. 
 Fuck a name, fuck tradition, religion, you learn Jesus. 
 Turn the other cheek, inherit the earth, just stay meek. 
 Fuck the way you speak, try to walk, we chop off your feet. 
 Fast forward to 2003; Niggas beef. 
 The psychology intrudin' the slaves to run deep. 
 Hell Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah 
 What's Beef? 
 Hell Yeah, yeah yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah 
 That's Beef 
 Hell Yeah, yeah yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah 
 It's always your own people, sometimes it's your own people 
 Hell Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah 
 What's Beef? 
 Hell Yeah, yeah yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah 
 That's Beef 
 Hell Yeah, yeah yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah 
 It's always your own people, sometimes it's your own people 
 (Mos Def): 
 Yo, Beef is not what Jay said to Nas, 
 Beef is when working niggas can't find jobs. 
 So they try to find niggas to rob, 
 Try to find bigger guns so they can finish the job. 
 Beef is when the crack kids can't find moms, 
 'Cause they in a pine box, or locked behind bars. 
 Beef ain't the summer Jam by Hot97. 
 Beef is the Cocaine and AIDS epidemic. 
 Beef don't come with a radio edit. 
 Beef is when the judge is calling you defendant. 
 Beef, it come with a long jail sentence, 
 Handed down to you in a few short minutes. 
 Beef is when your girl come through for a visit, 
 Talkin' 'bout her pregnant, by some other nigga. 
 Beef is high blood pressure and bad credit; 
 Need a loan for your home and you're too broke to get it. 
 And all your little kids is doin' is gettin' bigger, 
 You try not to raise them around these wild niggas. 
 Beef is when a gold-digger got your seed in her, 
 A manicured hand out, like, ""Pay me nigga, 
 Or I'm tellin' your wife, 
 And startin up some foul rumor that'll ruin your life."" 
 Beef is when a gangster ain't doing it right, 
 And other gangsters then decided what to do with his life. 
 Beef is not what these famous niggas do on the mic, 
 Beef is what George Bush would do in a fight. (that's right) 
 Beef is not what Ja said to Fifty. 
 Beef is world and earth not being here with me. 
 When a soldier ends his life with his own gun, 
 Beef is trying to figure out what to tell his son. 
 Beef is oil prices and geopolitics; 
 Beef is Iraq, the West Bank, and Gaza Strip. 
 Some beef is big, and some beef is small, 
 But what y'all call beef is no beef at all. 
 Beef is real life, happenin' every day, 
 And its realer than the songs that you gave to K-Slay. 
 This has been a Black Star P.S.A. 
 From Mos Def, Pretty Flaco, Black Dante, 
 From the Black Star Embassy B to the K!"
