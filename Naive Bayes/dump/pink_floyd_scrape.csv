0,Pink Floyd,rock,Astronomy Domine,"Lime and limpid green, a second scene 
 A fight between the blue you once knew 
 Floating down, the sound resounds 
 Around the icy waters underground 
 Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon, Miranda 
 And Titania, Neptune, Titan 
 Stars can frighten 
 Blinding signs flap 
 Flicker, flicker, flicker, blam, pow, pow 
 Stairway scared Dan Dare, who's there? 
 Lime and limpid green 
 The sound surrounds the icy waters under 
 Lime and limpid green 
 The sound surrounds the icy waters underground"

 Always sitting by your side 
 Always by your side 
 That cat's something I can't explain

 You're the left side 
 He's the right side oh no 
 That cat's something I can't explain 
 Lucifer go to sea 
 Be a hip cat 
 Be a ship's cat 
 Somewhere anywhere 
 That cat's something I can't explain 
 At night prowling sifting sand 
 Padding around on the ground 
 He'll be found 
 When you're around 
 That cat's something I can't explain"
2,Pink Floyd,rock,Matilda Mother,"There was a king who ruled the land 
 His majesty was in command 
 With silver eyes, the scarlet eagle 
 Showered silver on the people 
 Oh Mother, tell me more 
 Why'd'you have to leave me there 
 Hanging in my infant air, waiting 
 You only have to read the lines of 
 Scribbly black and everything shines 
 Across the stream with wooden shoes 
 Bells to tell the king the news 
 A thousand misty riders 
 Climb up higher once upon a time 
 Wondering and dreaming 
 The words had different meaning 
 Yes they did... 
 For all the time spent in that room 
 The doll's house darkness old perfume 
 And fairy stories held me high 
 On clouds of sunlight floating by 
 Oh Mother, tell me more 
 Tell me more..."
3,Pink Floyd,rock,Flaming,"Alone in the clouds all blue 
 Lying on an eiderdown, yippee 
 You can't see me but I can you 
 Lazing in the foggy dew 
 Sitting on a unicorn no fear 
 You can't hear me but I can you 
 Watching buttercups cup the light 
 Sleeping on a dandelion too much 
 I won't touch you but then I might 
 Screaming through the starlit skies 
 Traveling by telephone 
 Hey ho here we go 
 Ever so high 
 Alone in the clouds all blue 
 Lying on an eiderdown, yippee 
 You can't see me but I can you"

 Doctor, doctor, choke on bread 
 Doctor, doctor, underfed 
 Doctor, doctor, gold is lead 
 Doctor, doctor, Jesus bled 
 Doctor, doctor, pain is red 
 Doctor, doctor, dark doom 
 Gruel ghoul, greasy spoon 
 Used spool, June gloom 
 Why do you go? 
 And now 
 Music seems to help the pain 
 Seems to motivate the brain 
 Doctor, kindly tell your wife 
 That I'm alive, flowers thrive 
 Realise, realise

5,Pink Floyd,rock,The Gnome,"I want to tell you a story 
 About a little man if I can 
 A gnome named Grimble Gromble 
 And little gnomes stay in their homes 
 Eating, sleeping, drinking their wine 
 He wore a scarlet tunic 
 A blue-green hood, it looked quite good 
 He had a big adventure 
 Amidst the grass, fresh air at last 
 Wining dining biding his time 
 And then one day 
 Hooray, another way for gnomes to say 
 Ooh my... 
 Look at the sky, look at the river 
 Isn't it good? 
 Look at the sky, look at the river 
 Isn't it good? 
 Winding, finding places to go 
 And then one day 
 Hooray, another way for gnomes to say 
 Ooh my ooh my..."

7,Pink Floyd,rock,The Scarecrow,"The black and green scarecrow as everyone knows 
 Stood with a bird on his hat and straw everywhere, he didn't care 
 He stood in a field where barley grows 
 His head did no thinking his arms didn't move 
 Except when the wind cut up rough and mice ran around on the ground 
 He stood in a field where barley grows 
 The black and green scarecrow is sadder than me 
 But now he's resigned to his fate 'cause life's not unkind, he doesn't mind 
 He stood in a field where barley grows"
8,Pink Floyd,rock,Bike,"I've got a bike, you can ride it if you like 
 It's got a basket, a bell that rings 
 And things to make it look good 
 I'd give it to you if I could, but I borrowed it 
 You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world 
 I'll give you anything, everything if you want things 
 I've got a cloak, it's a bit of a joke 
 There's a tear up the front, it's red and black 
 I've had it for months 
 If you think it could look good, then I guess it should 
 You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world 
 I'll give you anything, everything if you want things 
 I know a mouse and he hasn't got a house 
 I don't know why I call him Gerald 
 He's getting rather old, but he's a good mouse 
 You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world 
 I'll give you anything, everything if you want things 
 I've got a clan of gingerbread men 
 Here a man, there a man, lots of gingerbread men 
 Take a couple if you wish, they're on the dish 
 You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world 
 I'll give you anything, everything if you want things 
 I know a room of musical tunes 
 Some rhyme, some ching, most of them are clockwork 
 Let's go into the other room and make them work"
9,Pink Floyd,rock,See Emily Play,"Emily tries but misunderstands 
 She's often inclined to borrow somebody's dreams till tomorrow 
 There is no other day 
 Let's try it another way 
 You'll lose your mind and play 
 Free games for may 
 See Emily play 
 Soon after dark Emily cries 
 Gazing through trees in sorrow, hardly a sound till tomorrow 
 There is no other day 
 Let's try it another way 
 You'll lose your mind and play 
 Free games for may 
 See Emily play 
 Put on a gown that touches the ground 
 Float on a river forever and ever 
 Emily, Emily 
 There is no other day 
 Let's try it another way 
 You'll lose your mind and play 
 Free games for may 
 See Emily play"

 Collecting clothes 
 Moonshine, washing line

12,Pink Floyd,rock,Apples And Oranges,"Got a flip-top pack of cigarettes in her pocket 
 Feeling good at the top 
 Shopping in sharp shoes 
 Walking in the sunshine town feeling very cool 
 But the butchers and the bakers in the supermarket stores 
 Getting everything she wants from the supermarket stores 
 Apples and oranges 
 Apples and oranges 
 Cornering neatly she trips up sweetly 
 To meet the people 
 She's on time again 
 And then 
 I catch her by the eye then I stop and have to think 
 What a funny thing to do 'cause I'm feeling very pink 
 Apples and oranges 
 Apples and oranges 
 I love she 
 She loves me 
 See you 
 See you 
 See you

 Feeding ducks in the afternoon tide (quack quack) 
 Apples and oranges 
 Apples and oranges

13,Pink Floyd,rock,Paint Box,"Last night I had too much to drink 
 Sitting in a club with so many fools 
 Playing to rules 
 Trying to impress but feeling rather empty 
 I had another drink 
 Drink - a - drink - a - drink - a - drink 
 What a way to spend that evening 
 They all turn up with their friends 
 Playing the game 
 They're in the scene always should have been 
 Far away 
 Away - away - away - away - away 
 Getting up, I feel as if I'm remembering this scene before 
 I open the door to an empty room 
 Then I forget 
 Pretend the phone rings and someone speaks 
 She would very much like to go out to a show 
 So what can I do - I can't think of what to say 
 She sees through anyway 
 Away - away - away - away - away 
 Out of the front door I go 
 Traffic's moving rather slow 
 Arriving late, there she waits 
 Looking very angry, as cross as she can be 
 Be - a - be - a - be - a - be - a - be 
 Getting up, I feel as if I'm remembering this scene before 
 I open the door to an empty room 
 Then I forget"

 His friends, they were very good to him 
 They gave him tea, and cakes and jam 
 And slices of delicious ham 
 Oh Mother tell me more 
 Why'd'you have to leave me there 
 Hanging in my infant air, waiting 
 You only have to read the lines of 
 Scribbly black and everything shines 
 The chief defect of Henry King 
 Was chewing little bits of string 
 At last he swallowed some which tied 
 Itself in ugly knots inside 
 Wondering and dreaming 
 The words have different meanings 
 Yes they did 
 Finding she was left alone 
 Went tiptoe to the telephone, 999 
 Summoned the immediate aid 
 Of London's Noble Fire Brigade 
 For all the time spent in that room 
 The doll's house darkness old perfume 
 And fairy stories held me high 
 On clouds of sunlight floating by 
 Oh Mother tell me more 
 Tell me more"
15,Pink Floyd,rock,It Would Be So Nice,"It would be so nice 
 It would be so nice 
 It would be so nice 
 To meet sometime 
 Everybody wakes, and in the morning 
 Hot tea and can't stop yawning 
 Pass the butter please 
 Have you ever read the Daily Standard? 
 Reading all about the plane that's landed 
 Upside down? 
 And no one knows what I did today 
 There can be no other way 
 But I would just like to say 
 It would be so nice 
 It would be so nice 
 It would be so nice 
 To meet sometime 
 It would be so nice 
 It would be so nice 
 It would be so nice 
 To meet sometime 
 Everybody cares about the weather 
 And everybody should know better 
 What a waste of time 
 Everybody lives beneath the ceiling 
 Living out a dream that sends them reeling 
 To a distant place 
 But no one knows what I did today 
 There can be no other way 
 But I would just like to say 
 It would be so nice 
 It would be so nice 
 It would be so nice 
 To meet sometime 
 It would be so nice

16,Pink Floyd,rock,Julia Dream,"Sunlight bright upon my pillow 
 Lighter than an eiderdown 
 Will she let the weeping willow 
 Wind his branches round 
 Julia dream, dreamboat queen, queen of all my dreams 
 Every night I turn the light out 
 Waiting for the velvet bride 
 Will the scaly armadillo 
 Find me where I'm hiding 
 Julia dream, dreamboat queen, queen of all my dreams 
 Will the misty master break me 
 Will the key unlock my mind 
 Will the following footsteps catch me 
 Am I really dying 
 Julia dream, dreamboat queen, queen of all my dreams 
 Julia dream, dreamboat queen, queen of all my dreams 
 Julia dream, dreamboat queen, queen of all my dreams 
 Julia dream, dreamboat queen, queen of all my dreams"

 People heard him say say 
 I will find a way way 
 There will come a day day 
 Something will be done 
 Then at last the mighty ship descending on a point of flame 
 Made contact with the human race at Mildenhall 
 Now now now is the time time time 
 To be be be aware 
 Carter's father saw it there 
 And knew the Rhull revealed to him 
 The living soul of Hereward the Wake 
 Oh my, something in my eye eye 
 Something in the sky sky 
 Waiting there for me 
 The outer lock rolled slowly back 
 The servicemen were heard to sigh 
 For there revealed in flowing robes was Lucy in the sky 
 Oh oh did you ever? 
 No no never ever will they 
 I'll say! 
 Summoning his cosmic power 
 And glowing slightly from his toes 
 His psychic emanations flowed"
18,Pink Floyd,rock,Remember A Day,"Remember a day before today 
 A day when you were young 
 Free to play along with time 
 Evening never comes 
 Sing a song that can't be sung 
 Without the morning's kiss 
 Queen you shall be if you wish 
 Look for your King 
 Why can't we play today? 
 Why can't we stay that way? 
 Climb your favourite apple tree 
 Try to catch the sun 
 Hide from your little brother's gun 
 Dream yourself away 
 Why can't we reach the sun? 
 Why can't we blow the years away? 
 Blow away 
 Blow away 
 Remember 
 Remember"
19,Pink Floyd,rock,Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun,"Little by little the night turns around 
 Counting the leaves which tremble at dawn 
 Lotuses lean on each other in yearning 
 Under the eaves the swallow is resting 
 Set the controls for the heart of the Sun 
 Over the mountain watching the watcher 
 Breaking the darkness, waking the grapevine 
 One inch of love is one inch of shadow 
 Love is the shadow that ripens the wine 
 Set the controls for the heart of the Sun 
 The heart of the Sun, the heart of the Sun 
 The heart of the Sun, the heart of the Sun 
 The heart of the Sun, the heart of the Sun 
 The heart of the Sun, the heart of the Sun 
 The heart of the Sun, the heart of the Sun 
 The heart of the Sun, the heart of the Sun 
 Witness the man who raves at the wall 
 Making the shape of his question to Heaven 
 Whether the sun will fall in the evening 
 Will he remember the lesson of giving? 
 Set the controls for the heart of the Sun 
 The heart of the Sun, the heart of the Sun 
 The heart of the Sun, the heart of the Sun 
 The heart of the Sun, the heart of the Sun 
 The heart of the Sun, the heart of the Sun 
 The heart of the Sun, the heart of the Sun 
 The heart of the Sun, the heart of the Sun 
 The heart of the Sun, the heart of the Sun"

 Picking up sister 
 He makes his way in to the see-saw land 
 All the way up she smiles 
 She goes up while he goes down, down 
 Sits on a stick in the river 
 Laughter in his sleep 
 Sister's throwing stones hoping for a hit 
 He doesn't know, so then 
 She goes up while he goes down, down 
 Another time, another day 
 A brother's way to leave 
 Another time, another day, day, day, day 
 She's selling plastic flowers on a Sunday afternoon 
 Picking up weeds 
 She hasn't got time to care 
 All can see he's not there 
 She grows up for another man, and he's down 
 Another time, another day 
 A brother's way to leave 
 Another time, another day, day, day, day 
 Another time, another day 
 A brother's way to leave"

 And I'm most obliged to you for making it clear that I'm not here 
 And I never knew the moon could be so big 
 And I never knew the moon could be so blue 
 And I'm grateful that you threw away my old shoes 
 And brought me here instead dressed in red 
 And I'm wondering who could be writing this song 
 I don't care if the sun don't shine 
 And I don't care if nothing is mine 
 And I don't care if I'm nervous with you 
 I'll do my loving in the winter 
 And the sea isn't green 
 And I love the Queen 
 And what exactly is a dream? 
 And what exactly is a joke?"

 That I'm leaving and maybe 
 You'd like to fly with me 
 And hide with me, baby 
 Isn't it strange how little we change? 
 Isn't it sad we're insane? 
 Playing the games that we know end in tears 
 The games we've been playing for thousands and thousands and thousands and 
 Jumps into his cosmic flyer 
 Pulls his plastic collar higher 
 Light the fuse and stand right back 
 He cried, ""This is my last goodbye"" 
 Point me at the sky and let it fly (Point me at the sky and let it fly) 
 Point me at the sky and let it fly (Point me at the sky and let it fly) 
 Point me at the sky and let it fly 
 And if you survive till two thousand and five 
 I hope you're exceedingly thin 
 For if you are stout you will have to breathe out 
 While the people around you breathe in, breathe in, breathe in, breathe in 
 People pushing on my sides 
 Is something that I hate 
 And so is sitting down to eat 
 With only little capsules on my plate 
 Point me at the sky and let it fly (Point me at the sky and let it fly) 
 Point me at the sky and let it fly (Point me at the sky and let it fly) 
 Point me at the sky and let it fly 
 And all we've got to say to you is goodbye 
 It's time to go, better run and get your bags, it's goodbye 
 Nobody cry, it's goodbye

 Yellow bird, you are not long 
 In singing and in flying on

 Swaying in the ripples and the reeds 
 On a trip to Cirrus Minor 
 Saw a crater in the Sun 
 A thousand miles of moonlight later"

 When I saw the lady smile 
 I would take her for a while 
 For a while 
 Like tears wept like a child 
 How her golden hair was blowing wild 
 Then she spread her wings to fly 
 For to fly 
 Soaring high above the breezes 
 Going always where she pleases 
 She will make it to the island in the Sun 
 I will follow in her shadow 
 And I'll watch her from my window 
 One day I will catch her eye 
 She is calling from the deep 
 Summoning my soul to endless sleep 
 She is bound to drag me down 
 Drag me down"

 We roll and roll 
 We roll and roll 
 Help me roll away the stone"

 Hazy were the visions overplayed 
 Sunlight on her eyes 
 But moonshine made her blind every time 
 Green is the colour of her kind 
 Quickness of the eye deceives the mind 
 Envy is the bond 
 Between the hopeful and the damned"

 Like a tube-train up your spine 
 Will the tightrope reach the end? 
 Will the final couplet rhyme? 
 And it's high time, Cymbaline 
 It's high time, Cymbaline 
 Please, wake me 
 A butterfly with broken wings 
 Is falling by your side 
 The ravens all are closing in 
 There's nowhere you can hide 
 Your manager and agent 
 Are both busy on the phone 
 Selling coloured photographs 
 To magazines back home 
 And it's high time, Cymbaline 
 It's high time, Cymbaline 
 Please, wake me 
 The lines converging where you stand 
 They must have moved the picture plane 
 The leaves are heavy around your feet 
 You hear the thunder of the train 
 Suddenly it strikes you 
 That they're moving into range 
 And Doctor Strange 
 Is always changing size 
 And it's high time, Cymbaline

 Please, wake me 
 And it's high time, Cymbaline 
 It's high time, Cymbaline

 I've lived every line that you wrote 
 Take me down, take me down 
 From the shelf above your head 
 And build me a time when the characters rhyme 
 And the storyline is kind 
 I live far enough on the shelf like the rest 
 And the epilogue reads like a sad song 
 Please, pick up your camera and use me again 
 And build me a time when the characters rhyme 
 And the storyline is kind 
 Yeah!"

 Misty morning whisperings 
 And gentle stirring sounds 
 Belied a deathly silence 
 That lay all around 
 Hear the lark and harken 
 To the barking of the dog fox 
 Gone to ground 
 See the splashing 
 Of the kingfisher flashing to the water 
 And a river of green is sliding 
 Unseen beneath the trees 
 Laughing as it passes 
 Through the endless summer 
 Making for the sea 
 In the lazy water meadow 
 I lay me down 
 All around me golden sunflakes 
 Settle on the ground 
 Basking in the sunshine 
 Of a by-gone afternoon 
 Bringing sounds of yesterday 
 Into this city room 
 Hear the lark and harken 
 To the barking of the dog fox 
 Gone to ground 
 See the splashing 
 Of the kingfisher flashing to the water 
 And a river of green is sliding 
 Unseen beneath the trees 
 Laughing as it passes 
 Through the endless summer 
 Making for the sea 
 In the lazy water meadow 
 I lay me down 
 All around me golden sunflakes 
 Covering the ground 
 Basking in the sunshine 
 Of a by-gone afternoon 
 Bringing sounds of yesterday 
 Into my city room 
 Hear the lark and harken 
 To the barking of the dog fox 
 Gone to ground 
 See the splashing 
 Of the kingfisher flashing to the water 
 A river of green is sliding 
 Unseen beneath the trees 
 Laughing as it passes 
 Through the endless summer 
 Making for the sea"

 And then cried ""Mary!"" and I tucked up 
 Wi' a Claymore out and about 
 And I run down, down the mechyn sty, 
 And back on fiery hore that was fallin' around the feet. 
 ""Never,"" I cried. ""Never shall ye get me alive 
 Ye rotten hound of the Burnie Brae."" 
 Well, I snapped for a blade and a Claymore cut and thrust 
 And I fell down before him 'round his feet. 
 Aye, a roar he cried! Frae the bottom of his heart

 And the wind cried Mary.

 But if you want to stay for a little bit 
 Rest your aching limbs for a little bit 
 Before you, the night is beckoning 
 And you know you can't delay 
 You hear the night birds calling you 
 But you can't catch the words they say 
 Close your ears and eyes, be on your way 
 Mist is swirling, creatures crawling 
 Hear the roar get louder in your ears 
 You know, the folly was your own 
 But the force behind can't conquer all your fears 
 And if you want to stay for a little bit 
 Rest your aching limbs for a little bit 
 Before you, the night is beckoning 
 And you know you can't delay 
 You hear the night birds calling you 
 But you can't catch the words they say 
 Close your ears and eyes, be on your way 
 Pull your thoughts back many years 
 To the time when there was life with every morning 
 Perhaps a day will come 
 When the light will be as clear as on that morning 
 And if you want to stay for a little bit 
 Rest your aching limbs for a little bit 
 Before you, the night is beckoning 
 And you know you can't delay 
 You hear the night birds calling you 
 But you can't catch the words they say 
 Close your ears and eyes, be on your way"

 If I were a train, I'd be late 
 And if I were a good man 
 I'd talk with you more often than I do 
 If I were asleep, I could dream 
 If I were afraid, I could hide 
 If I go insane 
 Please, don't put your wires in my brain 
 If I were the moon, I'd be cool 
 If I were the rule, I would bend 
 If I were a good man 
 I'd understand the spaces between friends 
 If I were alone, I would cry 
 And if I were with you, I'd be home and dry 
 And if I go insane 
 Will you still let me join in with the game?

 If I were a train, I'd be late again 
 If I were a good man 
 I'd talk with you more often than I do"
37,Pink Floyd,rock,Summer '68,"Would you like to say something before you leave? 
 Perhaps you'd care to state exactly how you feel 
 We say goodbye before we said hello 
 I hardly even like you, I shouldn't care at all 
 We met just six hours ago, the music was too loud 
 From your bed, I gained a day and lost a bloody year 
 And I would like to know 
 How do you feel (how do you feel)? 
 How do you feel (how do you feel)? 
 Not a single word was said, the night still hid our fears 
 Occasionally you showed a smile, but what was the need? 
 I felt the cold far too soon in a room of ninety-five 
 My friends are lying in the sun, I wish that I was there 
 Tomorrow brings another town, another girl like you 
 Have you time before you leave to greet another man? 
 Just you let me know 
 How do you feel (how do you feel)? 
 How do you feel (how do you feel)? 
 Goodbye to you 
 Charlotte Pringle's due 
 I've had enough for one day"
38,Pink Floyd,rock,Fat Old Sun,"When that fat old sun in the sky is falling 
 Summer-evening birds are calling 
 Summer Sunday and a year 
 The sound of music in my ears 
 Distant bells, new-mown grass 
 Smells so sweet 
 By the river holding hands 
 Roll me up and lay me down 
 And if you see, don't make a sound 
 Pick your feet up off the ground 
 And if you hear as the warm night folds 
 The silver sound from a tongue so strange, 
 Sing to me, sing to me 
 When that fat old sun in the sky is falling 
 Summer-evening birds are calling 
 Children's laughter in my ears 
 The last sunlight disappears 
 And if you see, don't make a sound 
 Pick your feet up off the ground 
 And if you hear as the warm night folds 
 The silver sound from a tongue so strange 
 Sing to me, sing to me 
 When that fat old sun in the sky is falling 
 Summer-evening birds are calling"

40,Pink Floyd,rock,A Pillow Of Winds,"A cloud of eiderdown draws around me softening the sound 
 Sleepy time when I lie with my love by my side and she's breathing low 
 And the candle dies 
 When night comes down you lock the door 
 The book falls to the floor 
 As darkness falls and waves roll by 
 The seasons change, the wind is warm 
 Now wakes the owl, now sleeps the swan 
 Behold a dream, the dream is gone 
 Green fields, a cold rain is falling 
 In a golden dawn 
 And deep beneath the ground the early morning sounds and I go down 
 Sleepy time when I lie with my love by my side and she's breathing low 
 And I rise like a bird in the haze when the first rays touch the sky 
 And the night winds die"
41,Pink Floyd,rock,Fearless,"You say the hill's too steep to climb 
 Chiding 
 You say you'd like to see me try 
 Climbing 
 You pick the place and I'll choose the time 
 And I'll climb the hill in my own way 
 Just wait a while for the right day 
 And as I rise above the tree line and the clouds 
 I look down, hear the sound of the things you said today 
 Fearlessly the idiot faced the crowd 
 Smiling 
 Merciless, the magistrate turns 'round 
 Frowning 
 And who's the fool who wears the crown 
 No doubt in your own way 
 And every day is the right day 
 And as you rise above the fear lines in his brow 
 You look down, hear the sound of the faces in the crowd 
 ...Walk on; walk on with hope in your heart, 
 And you'll never walk alone; 
 You'll never walk alone. 
 Walk on; walk on with hope in your heart, 
 And you'll never walk alone; 
 You'll never walk alone.

42,Pink Floyd,rock,San Tropez,"As I reach for a peach 
 Slide a line down behind a sofa in San Tropez 
 Breaking a stick with a brick on the sand 
 Riding a wave in the wake of an old sedan 
 Sleeping alone in the drone of the darkness 
 Scratched by the sand that fell from my love 
 Deep in my dreams and I still hear her calling 
 If you're alone, I'll come ho-ho-home 
 Backward and homebound, the pigeon, the dove 
 Gone with the wind and the rain on an airplane 
 Born in a home with no silver spoon 
 I'm drinking champagne like a good tycoon 
 Sooner than wait for a break in the weather 
 I'll gather my far-flung thoughts together 
 Speeding away on a wind to a new day 
 If you're alone, I'll come ho-ho-home 
 And I'll pause for a while by a country stile 
 And listen to the things they say 
 Digging for gold in a hole in my hand 
 Open the book, take a look at the way things stand 
 And you're leading me down to the place by the sea 
 I hear your soft voice calling to me 
 Making a date for later by phone 
 And if you're alone, I'll come ho-ho-home"

44,Pink Floyd,rock,Echoes,"Overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air 
 And deep beneath the rolling waves 
 In labyrinths of coral caves 
 The echo of a distant time 
 Comes willowing across the sand 
 And everything is green and submarine 
 And no-one showed us to the land 
 And no-one knows the wheres or whys 
 But something stirs and something tries 
 Now starts to climb towards the light 
 Strangers passing in the street 
 By chance two separate glances meet 
 And I am you and what I see is me 
 And do I take you by the hand 
 And lead you through the land 
 And help me understand the best I can 
 And no-one calls us to move on 
 And no-one forces down our eyes 
 No-one speaks and no-one tries 
 No-one flies around the sun 
 Cloudless everyday you fall upon my waking eyes 
 Inviting and inciting me to rise 
 And through the window in the wall 
 Come streaming in on sunlight wings 
 A million bright ambassadors of morning 
 And no-one sings me lullabies 
 And no-one makes me close my eyes 
 So I throw the windows wide 
 And call to you across the sky"
45,Pink Floyd,rock,Burning Bridges,"Bridges burning brightly 
 Merging with the shadow 
 Flickering between the lines 
 Stolen moments 
 Floating softly on the air 
 Borne on wings of fire 
 And climbing higher 
 Ancient bonds are breaking 
 Moving all and changing sides 
 1 
 Dreaming of a new day 
 Cast aside the other way 
 Magic vision stirring 
 Kindled by the burning flames 
 Rise in her eyes

 The door that stands ajar 
 The walls that once were high 
 Beyond the gilded cage 
 Beyond the reach of ties

 The moment is at hand 
 She breaks the golden band"
46,Pink Floyd,rock,The Gold It's In The ...,"Come on my friends, let's make for the hills 
 They say there's gold but I'm looking for thrills 
 You can get your hands on whatever we find 
 'Cause I'm only coming along for the ride 
 Well, you go your way, I'll go mine 
 I don't care if we get there on time 
 Everybody's searching for something they say 
 I'll get my kicks on the way 
 Over the mountains, across the sea 
 Who knows what may be waitin' for me 
 I can sail forever to strange sounding names 
 Faces of people and places don't change 
 All I have to do is just close my eyes 
 To see the seagulls wheeling in those far distant skies 
 All I wanna tell you, all I wanna say 
 Is count me in on the journey, don't expect me to stay"
47,Pink Floyd,rock,Wot's... Uh The Deal,"Heaven sent the promised land 
 Looks alright from where I stand 
 'Cause I'm the man on the outside looking in 
 Waiting on the first step 
 Show me where the key is kept 
 Point me down the right line because it's time 
 To let me in from the cold 
 Turn my lead into gold 
 'Cause there's a chill wind blowing in my soul 
 And I think I'm growing old 
 Flash the readies 
 Wot's... uh the deal 
 Got to make it to the next meal 
 Try to keep up with the turning of the wheel 
 Mile after mile stone after stone 
 You turn to speak but you're alone 
 Million miles from home you're on your own 
 So let me in from the cold 
 Turn my lead into gold 
 'Cause there's a chill wind blowing in my soul 
 And I think I'm growing old 
 Fire bright by candle light 
 With her by my side 
 And if she prefers we need never stir again 
 Someone sent the promised land 
 And I grabbed it with both hands 
 Now I'm the man on the inside looking out 
 Hear me shout, ""Come on in 
 What's the news, and where you been?"" 
 'Cause there's no wind left in my soul 
 And I've grown old"
48,Pink Floyd,rock,Childhood's End,"You shout in your sleep 
 Perhaps the price is just too steep 
 Is your conscious at rest 
 If once put to the test 
 You awake with a start 
 To just the beating of your heart 
 Just one man beneath the sky 
 Just two ears just two eyes 
 You set sail across the sea 
 Of long past thoughts and memories 
 Childhood's end your fantasies 
 Merge with harsh realities 
 And then as the sail is hoist 
 You find your eyes are growing moist 
 And all the fears never voiced 
 Say you have to make the final choice 
 Who are you and who am I 
 To say we know the reason why? 
 Some are born some men die 
 Beneath one infinite sky 
 There'll be war there'll be peace 
 But everything one day will cease 
 All the iron turn to rust 
 All the proud men turn to dust 
 So all things time will mend 
 And so this song will end"
49,Pink Floyd,rock,Free Four,"One, two, free four 
 The memories of a man in his old age 
 Are the deeds of a man in his prime 
 You shuffle in the gloom of the sick room 
 And talk to yourself as you die 
 Life is a short warm moment 
 And death is a long cold rest 
 You get your chance to try in the twinkling of an eye 
 Eighty years with luck or even less 
 So all aboard for the American tour 
 And maybe you'll make it to the top 
 But mind how you go and I can tell you 'cause I know 
 You may find it hard to get off 
 But you are the angel of death 
 And I am the dead man's son 
 He was buried like a mole in a fox-hole 
 And everyone's still in the run 
 And who is the master of foxhounds? 
 And who says the hunt has begun? 
 And who calls the tune in the courtroom? 
 And who beats the funeral drum? 
 The memories of a man in his old age 
 Are the deeds of a man in his prime 
 You shuffle in the gloom of the sick room 
 And talk to yourself as you die"
50,Pink Floyd,rock,Stay,"Stay 
 And help me to end the day 
 And if you don't mind 
 We'll break a bottle of wine 
 Stick around 
 And maybe we'll put one down 
 'Cause I wanna find 
 What lies behind those eyes 
 Midnight blue burning gold 
 A yellow moon is growing cold 
 I rise 
 Looking through my morning eyes 
 Surprised 
 To find you by my side 
 Rack my brain 
 And try to remember your name 
 To find 
 The words to tell you goodbye 
 Morning dues new born day 
 Midnight blue turned to grey 
 Midnight blue burning gold 
 A yellow moon is growing cold"
51,Pink Floyd,rock,Breathe,"Breathe, breathe in the air 
 Don't be afraid to care 
 Leave but don't leave me 
 Look around, choose your own ground 
 For long you live and high you fly 
 And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry 
 And all you touch and all you see 
 Is all your life will ever be 
 Run rabbit, run 
 Dig that hole forget the sun 
 And when at last the work is done 
 Don't sit down, it's time to dig another one 
 For long you live and high you fly 
 But only if you ride the tide 
 And balanced on the biggest wave 
 You race towards an early grave"

53,Pink Floyd,rock,Time,"Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day 
 Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way 
 Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town 
 Waiting for someone or something to show you the way 
 Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain 
 And you are young and life is long and there is time to kill today 
 And then one day you find ten years have got behind you 
 No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun 
 And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking 
 Racing around to come up behind you again 
 The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older 
 Shorter of breath and one day closer to death 
 Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time 
 Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines 
 Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way 
 The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say 
 Breathe Reprise 
 Home, home again 
 I like to be here when I can 
 When I come home cold and tired

 Calls the faithful to their knees 
 To hear the softly spoken magic spell"

 You rearrange me till I'm sane

 You shout and no one seems to hear 
 And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes

 Blown on the steel breeze 
 Come on you target for faraway laughter 
 Come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine! 
 You reached for the secret too soon 
 You cried for the moon 
 Shine on you crazy diamond 
 Threatened by shadows at night 
 And exposed in the light

 Come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine!"

 You bought a guitar to punish your ma 
 You didn't like school, and you know you're nobody's fool 
 So welcome to the machine 
 Welcome, my son 
 Welcome to the machine 
 What did you dream?

 We call it ""Riding the Gravy Train"" 
 We're just knocked out, we heard about the sell out 
 You gotta get an album out, you owe it to the people 
 We're so happy we can hardly count

 Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain 
 Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail? 
 A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell? 
 Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts? 
 Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze? 
 Cold comfort for change? Did you exchange 
 A walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage? 
 How I wish, how I wish you were here 
 We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl year after year 
 Running over the same old ground, what have we found? 
 The same old fears 
 Wish you were here"

66,Pink Floyd,rock,Dogs,"You gotta be crazy, you gotta have a real need 
 You gotta sleep on your toes, and when you're on the street 
 You gotta be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed 
 And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight 
 You gotta strike when the moment is right without thinking 
 And after a while, you can work on points for style 
 Like the club tie, and the firm handshake 
 A certain look in the eye and an easy smile 
 You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to 
 So that when they turn their backs on you 
 You'll get the chance to put the knife in 
 You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder 
 You know it's going to get harder, and harder and harder as you get older 
 And in the end you'll pack up and fly down south, hide your head in the sand 
 Just another sad old man, all alone and dying of cancer 
 And when you lose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown 
 And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone 
 And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around 
 So have a good drown, as you go down, all alone 
 [1] 
 Dragged down by the stone

 I gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused 
 Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used 
 Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise 
 If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my own way out of this maze? 
 Deaf, dumb and blind, you just keep on pretending 
 That everyone's expendable and no one has a real friend 
 And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner 
 And everything's done under the sun 
 And you believe at heart, everyone's a killer 
 Who was born in a house full of pain 
 Who was trained not to spit in the fan 
 Who was told what to do by the man 
 Who was broken by trained personnel 
 Who was fitted with collar and chain 
 Who was given a pat on the back 
 [3] 
 Who was breaking away from the pack 
 Who was only a stranger at home 
 Who was ground down in the end 
 Who was found dead on the phone 
 Who was dragged down by the stone 
 Who was dragged down by the stone

 What do you get for pretending the danger's not real 
 Meek and obedient, you follow the leader 
 Down well-trodden corridors, into the valley of steel 
 What a surprise! 
 A look of terminal shock in your eyes 
 Now things are really what they seem 
 No, this is no bad dream 
 The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want 
 He makes me down to lie 
 Through pastures green He leadeth me the silent waters by 
 With bright knives He releaseth my soul 
 He maketh me to hang on hooks in high places 
 He converteth me to lamb cutlets 
 For lo, He hath great power, and great hunger 
 When cometh the day we lowly ones 
 Through quiet reflection, and great dedication 
 Master the art of karate 
 Lo, we shall rise up 
 And then we'll make the bugger's eyes water.

 And it can't be much fun for them 
 Beneath the rising sun 
 With all their kids committing suicide. 
 What have we done? Maggie, what have we done? 
 What have we done to England? 
 Should we shout? Should we scream? 
 ""What happened to the post war dream?"" 
 Oh Maggie, Maggie what have we done?"
97,Pink Floyd,rock,Your Possible Pasts,"They flutter behind you, your possible pasts 
 Some bright-eyed and crazy, some frightened and lost 
 A warning to anyone still in command 
 (Ranks, fire) 
 Of their possible future, to take care 
 In derelict sidings the poppies entwine 
 With cattle trucks lying in wait for the next time 
 Do you remember me? How we used to be? 
 Do you think we should be closer? 
 (How are you tonight?) 
 She stood in the doorway, the ghost of a smile 
 Haunting her face like a cheap hotel sign 
 Her cold eyes imploring the men in their macs 
 For the gold in their bags or the knives in their backs 
 Stepping up boldly one put out his hand 
 He said, ""I was just a child then, now I'm only a man"" 
 Do you remember me? How we used to be? 
 Do you think we should be closer? 
 By the cold and religious we were taken in hand 
 Shown how to feel good and told to feel bad 
 Strung out behind us the banners and flags 
 Of our possible pasts lie in tatters and rags 
 Do you remember me? How we used to be? 
 Do you think we should be closer?"
98,Pink Floyd,rock,One Of The Few,"When you're one of the few to land on your feet 
 What do you do to make ends meet? 
 (Teach) 
 Make them mad, make them sad 
 Make them add two and two 
 Or make them me, or make them you 
 Make them do what you want them to 
 Make 'em laugh, make 'em cry 
 Make 'em lie down and die"
99,Pink Floyd,rock,When The Tigers Broke Free,"It was just before dawn one miserable morning in black forty-four 
 When the forward commander was told to sit tight when he asked that his men be withdrawn 
 And the generals gave thanks as the other ranks held back the enemy tanks for a while 
 And the Anzio Bridgehead was held for the price of a few hundred ordinary lives 
 And kind old King George sent mother a note when he heard that father was gone 
 It was, I recall, in the form of a scroll with gold leaf and all 
 And I found it one day in a drawer of old photographs, hidden away 
 And my eyes still grow damp to remember his majesty signed with his own rubber stamp 
 It was dark all around, there was frost in the ground when the tigers broke free 
 And no one survived from the Royal Fusiliers Company C 
 They were all left behind most of them dead, the rest of them dying 
 And that's how the High Command took my daddy from me"
100,Pink Floyd,rock,The Hero's Return,"Jesus, Jesus, what's it all about? 
 Tryin' to clout these little ingrates into shape 
 When I was their age all the lights went out 
 There was no time to whine or mope about 
 And even now part of me flies over 
 Dresden at angels one five 
 Though they'll never fathom it behind my 
 Sarcasm desperate memories lie 
 Sweetheart, sweetheart are you fast asleep? 
 Good 
 That's the only time that I can really speak to you 
 And there's something that I've locked away 
 A memory that is too painful to withstand the light of day 
 When we came back from the war 
 The banners and flags hung on everyone's door 
 We danced and we sang in the streets 
 And the church bells ring 
 But burning in my heart 
 My memory smolders on 
 Of the gunner's dying words 
 On the intercom"
101,Pink Floyd,rock,The Gunner's Dream,"Floating down through the clouds 
 Memories come rushing up to meet me now 
 But in the space between the heavens and the corner of some foreign field 
 I had a dream, I had a dream 
 Goodbye Max, goodbye Ma 
 After the service when you're walking slowly to the car 
 And the silver in her hair shines in the cold November air 
 You hear the tolling bell 
 And touch the silk in your lapel 
 And as the tear drops rise to meet the comfort of the band 
 You take her frail hand 
 And hold on to the dream 
 A place to stay 
 (""Oi! A real one ..."") 
 Enough to eat 
 Somewhere old heroes shuffle safely down the street 
 Where you can speak out loud 
 About your doubts and fears 
 And what's more, no one ever disappears 
 You never hear their standard issue kicking in your door 
 You can relax on both sides of the tracks 
 And maniacs don't blow holes in bandsmen by remote control 
 And everyone has recourse to the law 
 And no one kills the children anymore 
 And no one kills the children anymore 
 Night after night 
 Going 'round and 'round my brain 
 His dream is driving me insane 
 In the corner of some foreign field 
 The gunner sleeps tonight 
 What's done is done 
 We cannot just write off his final scene 
 Take heed of the dream 
 Take heed"
102,Pink Floyd,rock,Paranoid Eyes,"Button your lip and don't let the shield slip 
 1 
 Take a fresh grip on your bullet proof mask 
 And if they try to break down your disguise with their questions 
 You can hide hide hide 
 Behind paranoid eyes 
 You put on our brave face and slip over the road for a jar 
 Fixing your grin as you casually lean on the bar 
 Laughing too loud at the rest of the world 
 With the boys in the crowd 
 You can hide hide hide 
 2 
 Behind petrified eyes 
 You believed in their stories of fame fortune and glory 
 Now you're lost in a haze of alcohol soft middle age 
 The pie in the sky turned out to be miles too high 
 And you hide hide hide 
 Behind brown and mild eyes"
103,Pink Floyd,rock,Get Your Filthy Hands Off My Desert,"""Oi...Get your filthy hands off my desert!""

 And Begin took Beirut 
 Galtieri took the Union Jack 
 And Maggie, over lunch one day 
 Took a cruiser with all hands 
 Apparently, to make him give it back"
104,Pink Floyd,rock,The Fletcher Memorial Home,"Take all your overgrown infants away somewhere 
 And build them a home, a little place of their own 
 The Fletcher Memorial Home for Incurable Tyrants and Kings 
 And they can appear to themselves every day 
 On closed circuit T.V. 
 To make sure they're still real 
 It's the only connection they feel 
 Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Reagan and Haig 
 Mr. Begin and friend, Mrs. Thatcher, and Paisly 
 ""Hello, Maggie!"" 
 Mr. Brezhnev and party, 
 ""Scusi, dov'è il bar?"" 
 The ghost of McCarthy and the memories of Nixon 
 ""Who's the bald chap?"" 
 ""Good-bye!"" 
 And now, adding colour, a group of anonymous Latin-American meat packing glitterati 
 Did they expect us to treat them with any respect? 
 They can polish their medals and sharpen their smiles 
 And abuse themselves playing games for awhile 
 Boom boom, bang bang, lie down you're dead 
 Safe in the permanent gaze of a cold glass eye 
 Their favorite toy 
 They'll be good girls and boys 
 In the Fletcher Memorial Home for Colonial Wasters of Life and Limb 
 Is everyone in? 
 Are you having a nice time? 
 ""Sieg Heil!"" 
 Now the final solution can be applied"
105,Pink Floyd,rock,Southampton Dock,"They disembarked in '45 
 And no one spoke and no one smiled 
 There were too many spaces in the line 
 Gathered at the cenotaph 
 All agreed with hand on heart 
 To sheath the sacrificial knifes 
 Sieg Heil! 
 But now she stands upon Southampton dock 
 With her handkerchief and her summer frock 
 Clings to her wet body in the rain 
 In quiet desperation 
 Knuckles white upon the slippery reins 
 She bravely waves the boys goodbye again 
 Still the dark stain spreads between their shoulder blades 
 A mute reminder of the poppy fields and graves 
 When the fight was over we spent what they had made 
 But in the bottom of our hearts we felt the final cut"
106,Pink Floyd,rock,The Final Cut,"Through the fish-eyed lens of tear stained eyes 
 I can barely define the shape of this moment in time 
 And far from flying high in clear blue skies 
 I'm spiraling down to the hole in the ground where I hide 
 If you negotiate the minefield in the drive 
 And beat the dogs and cheat the cold electronic eyes 
 And if you make it past the shotguns in the hall 
 Dial the combination, open the priesthole 
 And if I'm in I'll tell you what's behind 
 the wall 
 [gunshot which obscures ""the wall""] 
 There's a kid who had a big hallucination 
 Making love to girls in magazines 
 He wonders if you're sleeping with your new found faith 
 Could anybody love him or is it just a crazy dream 
 And if I show you my dark side 
 Will you still hold me tonight? 
 And if I open my heart to you 
 And show you my weak side 
 What would you do? 
 Would you sell your story to Rolling Stone? 
 Would you take the children away and leave me alone? 
 And smile in reassurance as you whisper down the phone 
 Would you send me packing or would you take me home? 
 Thought I oughta bare my naked feelings 
 Thought I oughta tear the curtain down 
 I held the blade in trembling hands 
 Prepared to make it but 
 Just then the phone rang 
 I never had the nerve to make the final cut 
 ""Hello? Listen, I think I've got it. Okay, listen. It's a... Ha ha ha!"""

108,Pink Floyd,rock,Two Suns In The Sunset,"In my rear view mirror the sun is going down 
 Sinking behind bridges in the road 
 I think of all the good things that we have left undone 
 And I suffer premonitions 
 Confirm suspicions 
 Of the holocaust to come 
 The rusty wire that holds the cork that keeps the anger in 
 Gives way and suddenly it's day again 
 The sun is in the east even though the day is done 
 Two suns in the sunset 
 Could be the human race is run 
 Like the moment when the brakes lock 
 And you slide towards the big truck 
 (""Oh no!"") 
 You stretch the frozen moments with your fear 
 And you'll never hear their voices 
 (""Daddy, Daddy!"") 
 And you'll never see their faces 
 You have no recourse to the law anymore 
 And as the windshield melts and my tears evaporate 
 Leaving only charcoal to defend 
 Finally I understand the feelings of the few 
 Ashes and diamonds 
 Foe and friend 
 We were all equal in the end 
 ...and now the weather. Tomorrow will be cloudy with scattered showers spreading from the east ... with an expected high of 4000 degrees Celsius..."""
109,Pink Floyd,rock,Learning To Fly,"Into the distance, a ribbon of black 
 Stretched to the point of no turning back 
 A flight of fancy on a windswept field 
 Standing alone, my senses reeled 
 A fatal attraction is holding me fast 
 How can I escape this irresistible grasp? 
 Can't keep my eyes from the circling sky 
 Tongue-tied and twisted, just an earth-bound misfit, I 
 Ice is forming on the tips of my wings 
 Unheeded warnings, I thought I thought of everything 
 No navigator to find my way home 
 Unladened, empty and turned to stone 
 A soul in tension that's learning to fly 
 Condition grounded but determined to try 
 Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies

 Easy on the brakes. Take it easy. It's gonna roll this time 
 Just handle the power gradually, and it... 
 Above the planet on a wing and a prayer 
 My grubby halo, a vapour trail in the empty air 
 Across the clouds I see my shadow fly 
 Out of the corner of my watering eye 
 A dream unthreatened by the morning light 
 Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night 
 There's no sensation to compare with this 
 Suspended animation, a state of bliss 
 Can't keep my mind from the circling sky

110,Pink Floyd,rock,The Dogs Of War,"Dogs of war and men of hate 
 With no cause, we don't discriminate 
 Discovery is to be disowned 
 Our currency is flesh and bone 
 Hell opened up and put on sale 
 Gather 'round and haggle 
 For hard cash, we will lie and deceive 
 Even our masters don't know the webs we weave 
 One world, it's a battleground 
 One world, and we will smash it down 
 One world ... One world 
 Invisible transfers, long distance calls 
 Hollow laughter in marble halls 
 Steps have been taken, a silent uproar 
 Has unleashed the dogs of war 
 You can't stop what has begun 
 Signed, sealed, they deliver oblivion 
 We all have a dark side, to say the least 
 And dealing in death is the nature of the beast 
 One world, it's a battleground 
 One world, and we will smash it down 
 One world ... One world 
 (One world) 
 (One world) 
 The dogs of war don't negotiate 
 The dogs of war won't capitulate 
 They will take and you will give 
 And you must die so that they may live 
 You can knock at any door 
 But wherever you go, you know they've been there before 
 Well winners can lose and things can get strained 
 But whatever you change, you know the dogs remain

111,Pink Floyd,rock,One Slip,"A restless eye across a weary room 
 A glazed look and I was on the road to ruin 
 The music played and played as we whirled without end 
 No hint, no word her honour to defend 
 ""I will, I will,"" 
 she sighed to my request 
 And then she tossed her mane while my resolve was put to the test 
 Then drowned in desire, our souls on fire 
 I lead the way to the funeral pyre 
 And without a thought of the consequence 
 I gave in to my decadence 
 One slip and down the hole we fall 
 It seems to take no time at all 
 A momentary lapse of reason 
 That binds a life for life 
 A small regret, you won't forget 
 There'll be no sleep in here tonight 
 Was it love, or was it the idea of being in love? 
 Or was it the hand of fate that seemed to fit just like a glove? 
 The moment slipped by and soon the seeds were sown 
 The year grew late and neither one wanted to remain alone 
 One slip and down the hole we fall 
 It seems to take no time at all 
 A momentary lapse of reason 
 That binds a life to a life 
 You won't regret, you will never forget 
 There'll be no sleep in here tonight 
 One slip ... one slip"

 From the pale and downtrodden 
 And the words they say which we won't understand 
 ""Don't accept that what's happening 
 Is just a case of others' suffering 
 Or you'll find that you're joining in 
 The turning away"" 
 It's a sin that somehow 
 Light is changing to shadow 
 And casting its shroud over all we have known 
 Unaware how the ranks have grown 
 Driven on by a heart of stone 
 We could find that we're all alone 
 In the dream of the proud 
 On the wings of the night 
 As the daytime is stirring 
 Where the speechless unite in a silent accord 
 Using words you will find are strange 
 Mesmerised as they light the flame 
 Feel the new wind of change 
 On the wings of the night 
 No more turning away 
 From the weak and the weary 
 No more turning away from the coldness inside 
 Just a world that we all must share 
 It's not enough just to stand and stare 
 Is it only a dream that there'll be 
 No more turning away?"
113,Pink Floyd,rock,Yet Another Movie,"One sound, one single sound 
 One kiss, one single kiss 
 A face outside the window pane 
 However did it come to this? 
 A man who ran, a child who cried 
 A girl who heard, a voice that lied 
 The sun that burned a fiery red 
 The vision of an empty bed 
 The use of force, he was so tough 
 She'll soon submit, she's had enough 
 The march of fate, the broken will 
 Someone is lying very still 
 He has laughed and he has cried 
 He has fought and he has died 
 He's just the same as all the rest 
 He's not the worst, and he's not the best 
 And still this ceaseless murmuring 
 The babbling that I brook 
 The seas of faces, eyes upraised 
 The empty screen, the vacant look 
 A man in black on a snow white horse 
 A pointless life has run its course 
 The red rimmed eyes, the tears still run 
 As he fades into the setting sun"

 Plumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden sky 
 A man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers 
 But awakes to a morning with no reason for waking 
 He's haunted by the memory of a lost paradise 
 In his youth or a dream, he can't be precise 
 He's chained forever to a world that's departed 
 It's not enough, it's not enough 
 His blood has frozen and curdled with fright 
 His knees have trembled and given way in the night 
 His hand has weakened at the moment of truth 
 His step has faltered 
 One world, one soul 
 Time pass, the river rolls 
 (...It's not enough, It's not enough...) 
 And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication 
 And silent replies that swirl invitation 
 Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea 
 A grim intimation of what is to be 
 There's an unceasing wind that blows through this night 
 And there's dust in my eyes that blinds my sight 
 And silence that speaks so much louder than words 
 Of promises broken"
117,Pink Floyd,rock,What Do You Want From Me,"As you look around this room tonight 
 Settle in your seat and dim the lights 
 Do you want my blood, do you want my tears? 
 What do you want?

 Should I sing until I can't sing anymore? 
 Play these strings until my fingers are raw 
 You're so hard to please 
 What do you want from me? 
 Do you think that I know something you don't know? 
 (What do you want from me?) 
 If I don't promise you the answers, would you go? 
 (What do you want from me?) 
 Should I stand out in the rain? 
 Do you want me to make a daisy chain for you? 
 I'm not the one you need 
 What do you want from me?

 You can drift, you can dream, even walk on water 
 Anything you want 
 You can own everything you see

 Turn and face the light 
 What do you want from me?"

 And did you see it was all going to be so right for me?

 You were always the golden boy then 
 And that you'd never lose that light in your eyes? 
 Hey you... did you ever realise what you'd become? 
 And did you see that it wasn't only me you were running from? 
 Did you know all the time but it never bothered you anyway 
 Leading the blind while I stared out the steel in your eyes? 
 The rain fell slow, down on all the roofs of uncertainty 
 I thought of you and the years and all the sadness fell away from me 
 And did you know... 
 I never thought that you'd lose that light in your eyes"
119,Pink Floyd,rock,A Great Day For Freedom,"On the day the wall came down 
 They threw the locks onto the ground 
 And with glasses high we raised a cry for freedom had arrived 
 On the day the wall came down 
 The Ship of Fools had finally run aground 
 Promises lit up the night like paper doves in flight 
 I dreamed you had left my side 
 No warmth, not even pride remained 
 And even though you needed me 
 It was clear that I could not do a thing for you 
 Now life devalues day by day 
 As friends and neighbours turn away 
 And there's a change that, even with regret, cannot be undone 
 Now frontiers shift like desert sands 
 While nations wash their bloodied hands 
 Of loyalty, of history, in shades of grey 
 I woke to the sound of drums 
 The music played, the morning sun streamed in 
 I turned and I looked at you 
 And all but the bitter residue slipped away... slipped away"

 From my mouth (But still the screen is flickering) 
 I've spent too long (With an endless stream of garbage to)

 To the human touch (The self-destructing animal) 
 This bleeding heart's (Waiting for the waves to break)

 I don't even hear when I think aloud

 Wear its darkness with an empty smile 
 I'm creeping back to life 
 My nervous system all awry 
 I'm wearing the inside out 
 Look at him now 
 He's paler somehow 
 But he's coming round 
 He's starting to choke 
 It's been so long since he spoke 
 Well he can have the words right from my mouth 
 And with these words I can see 
 Clear through the clouds that covered me 
 Just give it time then speak my name 
 Now we can hear ourselves again 
 I'm holding out (He's standing on the threshold) 
 For the day (Caught in fiery anger) 
 When all the clouds (And hurled into the furnace he'll) 
 Have blown away (...curse the place) 
 I'm with you now (He's torn in all directions) 
 Can speak your name (And still the screen is flickering) 
 Now we can hear (Waiting for the flames to break)

 Ourselves again"
121,Pink Floyd,rock,Take It Back,"Her love rains down on me easy as the breeze 
 I listen to her breathing, it sounds like the waves on the sea 
 I was thinking all about her, burning with rage and desire 
 We were spinning into darkness; the earth was on fire 
 She could take it back, she might take it back someday 
 So I spied on her, I lied to her, I made promises I cannot keep 
 Then I hear her laughter rising, rising from the deep 
 And I make her prove her love for me, I take all that I can take 
 And I push her to the limit to see if she will break 
 She might take it back, she could take it back some day 
 Ring a ring o' roses, 
 A pocket full of posies, 
 Atishoo, atishoo, 
 We all fall down...

 Now I have seen the warnings, screaming from all sides 
 It's easy to ignore them and God 
 2 
 knows I've tried 
 All of this temptation, it turned my faith to lies 
 Until I couldn't see the danger or hear the rising tide 
 She can take it back, she will take it back some day 
 She can take it back, she will take it back some day 
 She will take it back, she will take it back some day"
122,Pink Floyd,rock,Coming Back To Life,"Where were you when I was burned and broken 
 While the days slipped by from my window watching 
 And where were you when I was hurt and I was helpless 
 'Cause the things you say and the things you do surround me 
 While you were hanging yourself on someone else's words 
 Dying to believe in what you heard 
 I was staring straight into the shining sun 
 Lost in thought and lost in time 
 While the seeds of life and the seeds of change were planted 
 Outside the rain fell dark and slow 
 While I pondered on this dangerous but irresistible pastime 
 I took a heavenly ride through our silence 
 I knew the moment had arrived 
 For killing the past and coming back to life 
 I took a heavenly ride through our silence 
 I knew the waiting had begun 
 And headed straight... into the shining sun"
123,Pink Floyd,rock,Keep Talking,"For millions of years mankind lived just like the animals 
 Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination 
 We learned to talk 
 There's a silence surrounding me 
 I can't seem to think straight 
 I'll sit in the corner 
 And no one can bother me 
 I think I should speak now (Why won't you talk to me?) 
 I can't seem to speak now (You never talk to me) 
 My words won't come out right (What are you thinking?) 
 I feel like I'm drowning (What are you feeling?) 
 I'm feeling weak now (Why won't you talk to me?) 
 But I can't show my weakness (You never talk to me) 
 I sometimes wonder (What are you thinking?) 
 Where do we go from here (What are you feeling?) 
 It doesn't have to be like this 
 All we need to do is make sure we keep talking 
 (Why won't you talk to me?) I feel like I'm drowning 
 (You never talk to me) You know I can't breathe now 
 (What are you thinking?) We're going nowhere 
 (What are you feeling?) We're going nowhere 
 (Why won't you talk to me?) 
 (You never talk to me) 
 (What are you thinking?) 
 (Where do we go from here?) 
 It doesn't have to be like this 
 All we need to do is make sure we keep talking"
124,Pink Floyd,rock,Lost For Words,"I was spending my time in the doldrums 
 I was caught in a cauldron of hate 
 I felt persecuted and paralysed 
 I thought that everything else would just wait 
 While you are wasting your time on your enemies 
 Engulfed in a fever of spite 
 Beyond your tunnel vision reality fades 
 Like shadows into the night 
 To martyr yourself to caution 
 Is not going to help at all 
 'Cause there'll be no safety in numbers 
 When the right one walks out of the door 
 Can you see your days blighted by darkness? 
 Is it true you beat your fists on the floor? 
 Stuck in a world of isolation 
 While the ivy grows over the door 
 So I open my door to my enemies 
 And I ask could we wipe the slate clean 
 But they tell me to please go fuck myself 
 You know you just can't win."
125,Pink Floyd,rock,High Hopes,"Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young 
 In a world of magnets and miracles 
 Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary 
 The ringing of the division bell had begun 
 Along the long road and on down the causeway 
 Do they still meet there by the Cut 
 There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps 
 Running before time took our dreams away 
 Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground 
 To a life consumed by slow decay 
 The grass was greener 
 The light was brighter 
 With friends surrounded 
 The nights of wonder 
 Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us 
 To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side 
 Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again 
 Dragged by the force of some inner tide 
 At a higher altitude with flag unfurled 
 We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world 
 Encumbered forever by desire and ambition 
 There's a hunger still unsatisfied 
 Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon 
 Though down this road we've been so many times 
 The grass was greener 
 The light was brighter 
 The taste was sweeter 
 The nights of wonder 
 With friends surrounded 
 The dawn mist glowing 
 The water flowing 
 The endless river 
 Forever and ever 
 (Spoken) 
 ""Hello?"" 
 ""Yes?"" 
 ""Is that Charlie?"" 
 ""Yes"" 
 ""Hello Charlie"" 
 ""Great""

126,Pink Floyd,rock,Things Left Unsaid,"(Rick) 
 We certainly have an unspoken understanding 
 But a lot of things unsaid as well 
 (David) 
 Well we shout and argue and fight and work it on out 
 (Nick) 
 The sum is greater than the parts"
127,Pink Floyd,rock,Talkin' Hawkin',"Speech has allowed the communication of ideas, enabling human beings to work together, to build the impossible 
 Mankind's greatest achievements have come about by talking 
 Our greatest hopes could become reality in the future 
 With the technology at our disposal, the possibilities are unbounded 
 All we need to do is make sure we keep talking"
128,Pink Floyd,rock,Louder Than Words,"We bitch and we fight 
 Diss each other on sight 
 But this thing we do 
 These times you get 
 Rain or shine or stormy weather 
 This thing we do 
 With world-weary grace 
 We've taken our places 
 We could curse it or nurse it 
 And give it a name 
 Or stay home by the fire 
 Failed by desire 
 Stoking the flames 
 But we're here for the ride 
 It's Louder than words 
 This thing that we do 
 Louder than words 
 The way it unfurls 
 It's louder than words 
 The sum of our parts 
 The beat of our hearts 
 Is louder than words 
 Louder than words 
 The strings bend and slide 
 As the hours fly by 
 An old pair of shoes, your favorite blues 
 Gonna tap out the rhythm 
 Let's go with the flow 
 Wherever it goes 
 We're more than alive 
 It's Louder than words 
 This thing that we do 
 Louder than words 
 The way it unfurls 
 It's louder than words 
 The sum of our parts 
 The beat of our hearts 
 Is louder than words 
 Louder than words 
 This thing they call soul 
 Is there with a pulse 
 Louder than words 
 Louder than words"
129,Pink Floyd,rock,Lucy Leave,"Leave when I ask you to leave, Lucy 
 Please fall away from me, Lucy 
 Oh, go, little girl 
 See that I'm so broken up about you, Lucy 
 Mean treatin' me and done me harm, Lucy 
 Been in love with you and your charms, Lucy 
 Oh, go, little girl 
 I'm in love with you, Lucy 
 You got my heart, you got my heart, oh no 
 You tear me apart, you just won't let me go 
 You hold on so tight, so tight I just can't breathe 
 Now Lucy leave, Lucy 
 Leave when I ask you to leave, little girl 
 Please fall away from me, little girl 
 Yeah, go, little girl 
 See that I'm so broke up about you, Lucy 
 Yeah, girl"
130,Pink Floyd,rock,Double O Bo,"Bo Diddley was a private eye 
 Hand was fast and his I.Q. high 
 D.A. said ""Double O, you won't last 
 Slow down boy, you living too fast"" 
 Well, Double O had a Cadillac 
 Machine guns and a bullet-proof back 
 Engine taken from a 707 
 Sounds like a sure way to get into heaven 
 In his pocket, 5 pounds of lead 
 Keep Bo Diddley from getting dead 
 Another thing helped Bo keeping alive 
 Was a snub-nosed, Smith And Wesson, Colt 45 
 Well, Bo drank gallons of rye and bourbon 
 Martini's dry, and you better serve them 
 Martini so dry, the shaker burst 
 Bo keeled on his side and died of thirst"
131,Pink Floyd,rock,Remember Me,"Remember me 
 I've been here before 
 Remember me 
 I've been here before 
 Can't you see 
 I'm gonna stick around some more 
 Can't you see 
 I want some love from you 
 Can't you see 
 I want some love from you 
 Don't go away now 
 I've got something to give to you 
 I'll try to be 
 As good as gold to you 
 Try to be 
 As good as gold to you 
 But don't blame me, girl 
 If I'm far from cold to you 
 Remember me 
 I've been here before 
 Remember me 
 I've been here before 
 Don't go away now 
 Come and stick around some more 
 Yeah"

 I love to, love to, love to, love to, love to 
 Walk with me, Sydney, it's a dark night

133,Pink Floyd,rock,Butterfly,"Listen all you girlies 
 Even though I haven't met you 
 Gonna catch you soon 
 In my butterfly net 
 You'd better watch out 
 Sometimes when I watch you 
 I stretch out my hand to touch you 
 'Cause it drives my me wild 
 To see you flutter by 
 You butterfly 
 I won't squeeze you dead 
 Aiming through your head 
 I just want your love 
 I won't cry your name 
 In Latin, in the rain 
 'Cause raining, it's a shame 
 Listen all you girlies 
 Even though I haven't met you 
 Gonna catch you soon 
 In my butterfly net 
 You'd better watch out"
134,Pink Floyd,rock,I'm A King Bee,"Well, I'm a king bee 
 Buzzing around your hive 
 Yes I'm a king bee, child 
 Buzzing around your hive 
 I can make good honey 
 Let me come inside 
 I'm young and able 
 To buzz all night long 
 You know, I'm young and able 
 To buzz all night long 
 When you hear me buzz little girl 
 You know there's some stinging going on 
 Well buzz 
 Oh sting 
 Yeah 
 Well, I'm a king bee 
 Can buzz all night long 
 Yes, I'm a king bee 
 Can buzz all night long 
 Well, I can buzz better baby 
 When your man is gone"
