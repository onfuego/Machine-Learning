 Are we gonna be more than a memory 
 I'm not over you 
 Are you over me 
 Are we gonna be more than a memory 
 Say my name 
 Cause no one else can say it quite the same 
 It takes me back to your September days 
 I've missed you way too much 
 If I was cruel to you 
 Well just to hear it breaks my heart in two 
 If there's a way to make it up to you 
 I wanna change so much you know I do 
 And you know that night I almost said I loved you

 When I needed someone?

 Once upon a time I 
 Thought you were the hero 
 I waited for you all night 
 I closed my eyes and slept for years 
 You kissed me like a sunrise 
 I feel it through my forehead 
 I felt it like a goodbye 
 I'm not myself 
 Sometimes I wish that I could change 
 But not for me, for you

 By my table I survive 
 Fix the makeup from my eyes 
 Fake a smile so they will see 
 Wish that you were here with me 
 Last year when my hands were cold 
 You were always there to hold 
 So give me your warmest pair 
 Your strongest pair of mittens 
 Please 
 Something to get me through 
 The loneliness of Winter 
 See, I fell for you, like crazy 
 And I can't get thoughts of you, from me 
 So give me your warmest pair 
 Your strongest pair of mittens 
 Please 
 Shine your name 
 Through the snow storm, baby 
 You can break me 
 To the bone, oh 
 I was wrong 
 You were wrong to make me 
 Feel like I was all alone, 
 Walking through my old home town 
 No one else but me around 
 Make an angel in the snow 
 Pray that I can let you go 
 I fell for you, like crazy 
 And I can't get thoughts of you, from me 
 So give me your warmest pair 
 Your strongest pair 
 Your warmest pair 
 See, I fell for you like crazy 
 And and I can't get thoughts of you, from me 
 So give me your warmest pair 
 Your strongest pair of mittens 
 Please"
57,Carly Rae Jepsen,pop,All I Need Is An Angel,"So what now? 
 Am I through? 
 Oh, won't someone tell me what to do? 
 Where to go 
 Who to be 
 How to find the right way back to me 
 Sunny day, won't you finally come my way? 
 If I stay so brave till then, will I find my way again? 
 'Cause all I need is an angel 
 I'll take a friend or a stranger 
 Yeah, all I need is an angel here tonight 
 Who'll say it's all alright 
 So what now? 
 Now I see 
 I may not be all I dreamed I'd be 
 Who will help fight this fear? 
 Who will show me where to go from here? 
 I won't mind 
 I will find the life I find 
 If I only have my guide 
 And together we will ride 
 'Cause all I need is an angel 
 I'll take a friend or a stranger 
 All I need is an angel here today 
 Who will help me find my way 
 One angel, please, with a sense of fashion 
 One angel, please, with a bit of passion 
 One angel who will guide me through 
 All I need is an angel 
 I'll take a friend or a stranger 
 All I need is an angel here with me 
 Come on, let me see my angel 
 To help me through all the changes 
 All I need is an angel 
 I'll be fine with an angel who's all mine 
 Won't you send me down a sign 
 And an angel who's all mine?"

59,Carly Rae Jepsen,pop,Part Of Your World,"Maybe he's right 
 Maybe there is something the matter with me 
 I just, I don't see how a world that makes such wonderful things could be bad 
 Look at this stuff 
 Isn't it neat? 
 Wouldn't you think my collection's complete? 
 Wouldn't you think I'm the girl 
 The girl who has everything? 
 Look at this trove, treasures untold 
 How many wonders can one cavern hold? 
 Lookin' around here you'd think 
 Sure, she's got everything 
 I've got gadgets and gizmos aplenty 
 I've got whozits and whatzits galore 
 You want thingamabobs? I got twenty 
 But who cares? 
 No big deal 
 I want more 
 I wanna be where the people are 
 I wanna see 
 Wanna see 'em dancin' 
 Walkin' around on those 
 What do ya call 'em? Oh - feet 
 Flippin' your fins you don't get too far 
 Legs are required for jumpin', dancin' 
 Strollin' along down a 
 What's that word again? Street 
 Up where they walk 
 Up where they run 
 Up where they stay all day in the sun 
 Wanderin' free 
 Wish I could be 
 Part of that world 
 What would I give 
 If I could live 
 Out of these waters? 
 What would I pay 
 To spend a day 
 Warm on the sand? 
 Betcha on land 
 They understand 
 That they don't reprimand their daughters 
 Bright young women 
 Sick of swimmin' 
 Ready to stand 
 I'm ready to know what the people know 
 Ask them my questions 
 And get some answers 
 What's a fire and why does it 
 What's the word? Burn? 
 When's it my turn? 
 Wouldn't I love 
 Love to explore that shore above? Oh 
 Out of the sea 
 Wish I could be 
 Part of that world"

 Hold tight 
 To me all summer 
 Reading my 
 Magazines 
 Dancing 
 In my blue jeans 
 Pucker up in sunglasses 
 Making love to the flashes 
 Posing the way that we do 
 For everybody to see 
 Pull over through your lashes 
 Only thing that will last is 
 I take a picture of you 
 Taking a picture of me 
 I take a picture of you 
 Taking a picture of me 
 I take a picture of you 
 Taking a picture of me 
 Tomorrow always happens too soon 
 I wish I had an electric moon 
 To save the light 
 Hmm... the light 
 Fireworks 
 And night's dreamers 
 Baby blue 
 With the day dreamers 
 Under water 
 Close to me 
 Hold my breath 
 In my blue jeans 
 Pucker up in sunglasses 
 Making love to the flashes 
 Posing the way that we do 
 For everybody to see 
 Pull over through your lashes 
 Only thing that will last is

 To save...

 Tonight 
 I wanna see 
 The light 
 And it goes on and on and on 
 And we go on and on and on 
 I wanna live live live 
 We wanna live live live

 I wanna smash your fears 
 And get drunken off your tears 
 Don't you share your smile with anyone else but me 
 I wanna touch your heart 
 I wanna crush it in my hands 
 Make you plead and cry as you give up all the lies 
 We're not lovers 
 But more than friends 
 Put a flame to every single word you ever said 
 No more crying 
 To get me through 
 I'll keep dancing till the morning with somebody new 
 Tonight I'm getting over you 
 Tonight I'm getting over you 
 Tonight I'm getting over you 
 Tonight I'm getting over you 
 Over you 
 Over you 
 Stuck in a real bad dream 
 And man it feels so new to me 
 Should be in your arms but I'm begging at your feet 
 It's been a real hard night 
 And I just hold my pillow tight 
 It won't love me back, no, it's not you and I 
 We're not lovers 
 But more than friends 
 Put a flame to every single word you ever said 
 No more crying

 A Celine bag on my shoulderrr

 I said I'm number one, I'm a son a gun, 
 And runner up is what they called ya 
 Ain't trying to be mean but, I am the queen, yuh 
 Ain't fucking with no fuck boys! 
 Get me get me, should've got me then 
 'Cause I would wear 4 real and you would rock pretend 
 Yo, can I get another dose of my oxygen 
 'Cause I been breathing all this motherfucking toxin in!

 Tell me baby, do you recognize me? 
 It's been a year, you know it doesn't surprise me 
 Merry Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it 
 Merry Christmas, I loved you and I meant it 
 Now I know what a fool I've been 
 But if you kissed me now 
 I know you'd fool me again 
 Last Christmas I gave you my heart 
 But the very next day you gave it away 
 This year, to save me from tears 
 I'll give it to someone special (special)

 A crowded room, friends with tired eyes 
 I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice 
 My God, I thought you were someone to rely on (someone to rely on) 
 Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on 
 A face on a lover with a fire in his heart (fire in his heart) 
 A man undercover but you tore me apart (me apart) 
 Merry Christmas 
 Merry Christmas 
 Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

 Whatever happened to predictability? 
 The milkman, the paperboy, the evening TV? 
 How did I get delivered here? Somebody tell me please 
 'Cause this old world is just really confusing me 
 Clouds as mean as you've ever seen 
 Ain't a bird that knows your tune 
 Then a little voice inside of you whispers 
 ""Kid, don't sell your dreams so soon!"" 
 Everywhere you look, everywhere you go 
 There's a heart (there's a heart), a hand to hold on to 
 Everywhere you look, everywhere you go 
 There's a face (there's a face) of somebody who needs you 
 La la la la la la la 
 La la la la la la 
 Whatever happened to the good old days? 
 Talking to friends for hours, swore it'd never go away 
 Now I'm feeling a little crazy, trying to fit in with a scene 
 'Cause how do you know where you're going if you really don't know who you've been? 
 Everybody eventually 
 Says that they're as lost as you 
 So everybody shout it together 
 ""Hey (hey), don't sell your dreams so soon!"" 
 Everywhere you look, everywhere you go 
 There's a heart (there's a heart), a hand to hold on to

 A light is waiting to carry you home

 Everywhere you look, everywhere you go
