1,Sam Smith,pop,Nirvana,"Oh, baby 
 Oh, baby 
 Oh, we both know the truth 
 If it were the real me and you 
 This wouldn't be the right thing to do 
 Now the room is all hazy 
 We're too lost in the fumes 
 I feel like it's just me and you 
 Yeah, we got nothing to lose 
 It's too late to run away from it all 
 It's too late to get away from it all 
 I'm done with running, so I give it to you 
 This moment has caused a reaction 
 Resulting in a reattachment 
 Girl, you take me to Nirvana 
 I don't think this will last 
 Cause you're here in my arms 
 Oh, baby 
 Oh, baby 
 Oh, we both feel the same 
 I'm not gonna give you my name 
 And I don't think you want that to change 
 We're in this together 
 We don't know who we are 
 Even if it's moving too fast 
 Maybe we should take it too far 
 It's too late to run away from it all 
 It's too late to get away from it all 
 I'm done with running, so I give it to you 
 This moment has caused a reaction 
 Resulting in a reattachment 
 Girl, you take me to Nirvana 
 I don't think this will last 
 Cause you're here in my arms 
 Well, you take me to Nirvana 
 I don't think this will last 
 Cause you're here in my arms"
2,Sam Smith,pop,I've Told You Now,"You know what I mean 
 It's like walking in the heat all day with no water 
 It's like waiting for a friend 
 Watching everybody else meet theirs on that corner 
 Or losing in an argument 
 Although you're right can't get your thoughts in order 
 Still I refrain 
 From talking at you, talking on 
 You know me well 
 I don't explain 
 But what the hell 
 Why do you think I come 'round here on my free will? 
 Wasting all my precious time 
 Oh, the truth spills out 
 And oh oh ooh, oh I've 
 I've told you now 
 You know what I mean 
 Although I try my best I still let down the team 
 You're everything I want 
 Why should I resist when you are there for me? 
 Should I refrain 
 From talking at you, talking on 
 You know me well 
 I don't explain 
 But what the hell 
 Why do you think I come 'round here on my free will? 
 Wasting all my precious time 
 Oh, the truth spills out 
 And oh oh ooh, oh I've 
 I've told you now 
 I've told you now 
 And I've told you now! 
 And I've told you now! 
 Still I refrain 
 From talking at you, talking on 
 You know me well 
 I don't explain 
 So what the hell 
 Why do you think I come 'round here on my free will? 
 Wasting all my precious time 
 What the hell 
 Why do you think I come 'round here on my own will? 
 Wasting all my precious time 
 Oh, the truth spills out 
 And oh oh ooh, oh I've 
 I've told you now"
3,Sam Smith,pop,Latch,"You lift my heart up when the rest of me is down 
 You, you enchant me even when you're not around 
 If there are boundaries, I will try to knock them down 
 I'm latching on, babe, now I know what I have found 
 I feel we're close enough 
 Could I lock in your love 
 I feel we're close enough 
 Could I lock in your love 
 Now I've got you in my space 
 I won't let go of you 
 Got you shackled in my embrace 
 I'm latching on to you 
 I'm so enraptured, got me wrapped up in your touch 
 Feel so enamored, hold me tight within your clutch 
 How do you do it, you got me losing every breath 
 What did you give me to make my heart beat out my chest 
 I feel we're close enough 
 Could I lock in your love 
 I feel we're close enough 
 Could I lock in your love 
 Now I've got you in my space 
 I won't let go of you 
 Got you shackled in my embrace 
 I'm latching on to you 
 Now I've got you in my space 
 I won't let go of you 
 Got you shackled in my embrace 
 I'm latching on to you 
 I'm latching on 
 To you"
4,Sam Smith,pop,Money On My Mind,"When I signed my deal 
 I felt pressure 
 Don't wanna see the numbers 
 I wanna see heaven 
 You say, could you write a song for me? 
 I say, I'm sorry I won't do that happily 
 When I go home 
 I tend to close the door 
 I never wanted more 
 So sing with me 
 Can't you see 
 I don't have 
 Money on my mind 
 Money on my mind 
 I do it for 
 I do it for the love 
 I don't have 
 Money on my mind 
 Money on my mind 
 I do it for 
 I do it for the love 
 I do it for the love 
 I do it for the love 
 Please don't get me wrong 
 I wanna keep it moving 
 I know what that requires 
 I'm not foolish 
 Please, can you make this work for me? 
 'Cause I'm not a puppet, I will work against your strings 
 When I go home 
 I tend to close the door 
 I never wanted more 
 So sing with me 
 Can't you see 
 I don't have 
 Money on my mind 
 Money on my mind 
 I do it for 
 I do it for the love 
 I don't have 
 Money on my mind 
 Money on my mind 
 I do it for 
 I do it for the love 
 I do it for the love 
 I do it for the love 
 When the sun will set 
 Don't you fret 
 No I have no money on my mind 
 No money on my mind 
 No money on my mind 
 No I have no money on my mind 
 When the sun will set 
 Don't you fret 
 No I have no money on my mind 
 No money on my mind 
 No money on my mind 
 No I have no money on my mind 
 Just love 
 Money on my mind 
 Money on my mind 
 I do it for 
 I do it for the love 
 I don't have 
 Money on my mind 
 Money on my mind 
 I do it for 
 I do it for the love 
 I do it for the love 
 I do it for the love"
5,Sam Smith,pop,Good Thing,"I had a dream I was mugged outside your house 
 I had a dream in a panic you came running out 
 For a moment you were sure I'd die on you 
 For a moment I believed you loved me too 
 But life is never like this, and you're never strong 
 Too much of a good thing won't be good for long 
 Although you made my heart sing, to stay with you would be wrong 
 Too much of a good thing won't be good anymore 
 Watch where I tread before I fall 
 We'd talk maybe 20 times a day 
 And still I never say what I want to say 
 I thought I wouldn't need to 
 I guess I read you wrong 
 Too much of a good thing won't be good for long 
 Although you made my heart sing, to stay with you would be wrong 
 Too much of a good thing won't be good anymore 
 Watch where I tread before I fall 
 You refuse to see this, don't see it anymore 
 I have made the decision not to answer your calls 
 'Cause I put everything out there and I got nothing at all 
 Too much of a good thing isn't good and you know 
 I watch where I walk before I fall 
 Before I fall"

7,Sam Smith,pop,Leave Your Lover,"I don't have much to give, but I don't care for gold 
 What use is money, when you need someone to hold 
 Don't have direction I'm just rolling down this road 
 Waiting for you to bring me in from out the cold 
 You'll never know the endless nights, the rhyming of the rain 
 Or how it feels to fall behind and watch you call his name 
 Pack up and leave everything, don't you see what I can bring 
 Can't keep this beating heart at bay 
 Set my midnight terror free, I will give you all of me 
 Leave your lover, leave him for me 
 We sit in bars and raise our drinks to growing old 
 I'm in love with you and you will never know 
 But if I can't have you I'll walk this life alone 
 Spare you the rising storms and let the river flow 
 You'll never know the endless nights, the rhyming of the rain 
 Or how it feels to fall behind and watch you call his name 
 Pack up and leave everything, don't you see what I can bring 
 Can't keep this beating heart at bay 
 Set my midnight terror free, I will give you all of me 
 Leave your lover, leave him for me 
 Leave your lover, leave him for me"
8,Sam Smith,pop,I'm Not The Only One,"You and me, we made a vow 
 For better or for worse 
 I can't believe you let me down 
 But the proof's in the way it hurts 
 For months on end I've had my doubts 
 Denying every tear 
 I wish this would be over now 
 But I know that I still need you here 
 You say I'm crazy 
 'Cause you don't think I know what you've done 
 But when you call me baby 
 I know I'm not the only one 
 You've been so unavailable 
 Now sadly I know why 
 Your heart is unobtainable 
 Even though God knows you have mine 
 You say I'm crazy 
 'Cause you don't think I know what you've done 
 But when you call me baby 
 I know I'm not the only one 
 I have loved you for many years 
 Maybe I am just not enough 
 You've made me realize my deepest fear 
 By lying and tearing us up 
 You say I'm crazy 
 'Cause you don't think I know what you've done 
 But when you call me baby 
 I know I'm not the only one 
 You say I'm crazy 
 'Cause you don't think I know what you've done 
 But when you call me baby 
 I know I'm not the only one 
 I know I'm not the only one 
 I know I'm not the only one 
 And I know, and I know, and I know, 
 And I know, and I know, and I don't know 
 I know I'm not the only one"
9,Sam Smith,pop,Like I Can,"He could be a sinner, or a gentleman 
 He could be your preacher, when your soul is damned 
 He could be your lawyer on a witness stand but 
 He'll never love you like I can, can 
 He could be a stranger you gave a second glance 
 He could be a trophy of a one night stand 
 He could have your humour that I don't understand 'cause 
 He'll never love you like I can, can, can 
 Why are you looking down all the wrong roads 
 When mine is the heart and the soul that is sore 
 There may be lovers who hold out their hands but 
 He'll never love you like I can, can, can 
 He'll never love you like I can, can 
 A chance encounter of circumstance 
 Maybe he's a mantra, keeps your mind entranced 
 He could be the silence in this mayhem, but then again 
 He'll never love you like I can, can, can 
 Why are you looking down all the wrong roads 
 When mine is the heart and the soul that is sore 
 There may be lovers who hold out their hands but 
 He'll never love you like I can, can, can 
 He'll never love you like I can, can, can 
 He'll never love you like I can, can, can 
 We both have demons, that we can't stand 
 I love your demons, like devils can 
 If you're still seeking an honest man 
 And stop deceiving Lord please 
 Why are you looking down all the wrong roads 
 When mine is the heart and the soul that is sore 
 There may be lovers who hold out their hands but 
 He'll never love you like I can, can, can 
 He'll never love you like I can, can, can 
 He'll never love you like I can, can, can"
10,Sam Smith,pop,Life Support,"I've been sleeping with the lights on 
 'Cause the darkness is surrounding you 
 This is my world, this is my choice 
 And you're the drug that gets me through 
 I've been waiting for an answer 
 Because I built this bed for two 
 I'm just waiting on your answer 
 I built this bed for me and you 
 Could you see that I am yours? 
 So will you be my life support? 
 You're my life support 
 You're my life support 
 Sick of waking up in darkness 
 When the sky is always painted blue 
 There's a method to my madness 
 It's clear that you don't have a clue 
 I've been waiting for an answer 
 Because I built this bed for two 
 I'm just waiting on your answer 
 I built this bed for me and you 
 Could you see that I am yours? 
 So will you be my life support? 
 You're my life support 
 You're my life support 
 You're my life support 
 You're my life support 
 Can't you see that I am yours? 
 So will you be my life support? 
 I've been sleeping with the lights on 
 'Cause the darkness is surrounding you"
11,Sam Smith,pop,Not In That Way,"And I hate to say I love you 
 When it's so hard for me 
 And I hate to say I want you 
 When you make it so clear 
 You don't want me 
 I'd never ask you cause deep down 
 I'm certain I know what you'd say 
 You'd say I'm sorry believe me 
 I love you but not in that way 
 And I hate to say I need you 
 I'm so reliant 
 I'm so dependant 
 I'm such a fool 
 When you're not there 
 I find myself singing the blues 
 Can't bear 
 Can't face the truth 
 You will never know that feeling 
 You will never see through these eyes 
 I'd never ask you 
 Cause deep down I'm certain I know what you'd say 
 You'd say I'm sorry 
 Believe me 
 I love you 
 But not in that way 
 You'd say I'm sorry 
 Believe me 
 I love you 
 But not in that way"
12,Sam Smith,pop,Lay Me Down,"Yes I do, I believe 
 That one day I will be, where I was 
 Right there, right next to you 
 And it's hard, the days just seem so dark 
 The moon, the stars, are nothing without you 
 Your touch, your skin, where do I begin? 
 No words can explain, the way I'm missing you 
 The night, this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside 
 These tears, they tell their own story 
 You told me not to cry when you were gone 
 But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong 
 Can I lay by your side, next to you, you 
 And make sure you're alright 
 I'll take care of you 
 And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight 
 I'm reaching out to you 
 Can you hear my call? 
 This hurt that I've been through 
 I'm missing you, missing you like crazy, daily 
 Can I lay by your side, next to you, you 
 And make sure you're alright 
 I'll take care of you 
 And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight 
 Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side 
 Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side 
 Can I lay by your side, next to you, you 
 And make sure you're alright"
13,Sam Smith,pop,Restart,"It was a Monday night when you told me it was over babe 
 And by the Friday night, I knew that I would be okay 
 Don't say it was a good thing 
 Don't say it was the right thing to do 
 Don't say it was the best thing for the both of us 
 When I'm the one playing the fool 
 What do you want from me when I just wanna restart 
 You keep coming back for me when you're the one who tore us apart 
 And the truth is I'm better on my own 
 And I'm the one to leave it apart 
 So let me restart 
 So let me restart 
 So let me restart 
 You've been lightin' up my phone 
 Worried that I'll be alone tonight 
 Wanna make sure that I'm fine 
 But baby you're not on my mind, no more 
 I know it was the best thing for the both of us 
 'Cause you're the one who looks like a fool 
 What do you want from me when I just wanna restart 
 You keep coming back for me when you're the one who tore us apart 
 And the truth is I'm better on my own 
 And I'm the one to leave it apart 
 So let me restart 
 So let me restart 
 So let me restart 
 So let me restart 
 What do you want from me when I just wanna restart 
 You keep coming back for me when you're the one who tore us apart 
 And the truth is I'm better on my own 
 And I'm the one to leave it apart 
 So let me restart 
 So let me restart 
 So let me restart 
 So let me restart 
 So let me restart

14,Sam Smith,pop,Reminds Me Of You,"I've gotta get out of here 
 This town's no longer fun 
 And I'm falling closer, falling closer 
 Closer to the sun 
 I've gotta get out of here 
 Come kiss another face 
 'Cause it hurts too bad, it hurts too bad 
 And I don't like the taste 
 You say it's over, leaving me so far from sober 
 Now summer is colder, I lean on a stranger's shoulder 
 I walk the streets and hear heartbeats and city smoulder 
 Without a trace I'm under 
 And God knows I try 
 Looking for lovers at night 
 But each time I do 
 It only reminds me of you 
 It only reminds me of you 
 I've gotta get out of here 
 'Cause you'll never want me back 
 You are moving on, moving on 
 And I'm stuck on the track 
 I've gotta get out of here 
 Before I self-destruct 
 And I don't want, and I don't want 
 My heart to ever stop 
 I walk the streets and hear heartbeats and city smolder 
 Without a trace I'm under 
 And God knows I try 
 Looking for lovers at night 
 But each time I do 
 It only reminds me of you 
 It only reminds me of you 
 And God knows I try 
 Looking for lovers at night 
 But each time I do 
 It only reminds me of you 
 It only reminds me of you 
 It only reminds me of you"
15,Sam Smith,pop,Make It To Me,"My mind runs away to you 
 With the thought I hope you'll see 
 Can't see where it's wandered too 
 But I know where it wants to be 
 I'm waiting patiently though time is moving slow 
 I have one vacancy and I wanted you to know that 
 You're the one designed for me 
 A distant stranger that I will complete 
 I know you're out there we're meant to be 
 So keep your hair down and make it to me 
 And make it to me 
 So sick of this lonely air 
 It seems such a waste of breath 
 So much that I need to say 
 So much to get off my chest 
 I'm waiting patiently though time is moving slow 
 I have one vacancy and I wanted you to know that 
 You're the one designed for me 
 A distant stranger that I will complete 
 I know you're out there we're meant to be 
 So keep your hair down and make it to me

 I'll sing a song about someone new 
 But right here, right now, you are on my mind 
 And I think about you all the time 
 I'm sending a message to you 
 And I'm hoping that it will get through 
 When it was good, it was bittersweet, honey 
 You made me sad till I loved the shade of blue 
 I know you don't want to talk to me, so this is what I will do 
 Maybe you're listening, so here's one last song for you 
 Here's one last song for you 
 And I hope it makes you feel 
 And I hope it makes you burn 
 And I hope it reminds you of how much it hurt

19,Sam Smith,pop,Midnight Train,"I choose me, and I know that's selfish, love 
 You are a dream, and I can't thank you enough 
 But I give another piece of me away 
 Every waking day that I'm with you 
 Am I a monster? What will your family think of me? 
 They brought me in, they helped me out with everything 
 But I give a little piece of me away 
 Every single day 
 So I pick up the pieces, I get on the midnight train 
 I got my reasons, but darling I can't explain 
 I'll always love you 
 But tonight's the night I choose to walk away 
 Bah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo 
 Bah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo 
 Love you so much that I have to let you go 
 I'll miss your touch and the secrets we both know 
 But it would be wrong for me to stay 
 And I'll just give you hope 
 So I pick up the pieces, I get on the midnight train 
 I got my reasons, but darling I can't explain 
 I'll always love you 
 But tonight's the night I choose to walk away 
 I can't stop crying, I hate that I've caused you pain 
 But I can't deny it, I just don't feel the same 
 I'll always love you 
 But tonight's the night I choose to walk away 
 Bah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo 
 Bah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo 
 So I pick up the pieces, I get on the midnight train 
 I got my reasons, but darling I can't explain 
 I'll always love you 
 But tonight's the night I choose to walk away"
20,Sam Smith,pop,Burning,"I've been burning 
 Yes, I've been burning 
 Such a burden 
 This flame on my chest 
 No insurance to pay for the damage 
 Yeah, I've been burning up since you left 
 I've been smoking, oh 
 More than twenty a day 
 Blame it on rebellion 
 Don't blame it on me 
 Wish I was younger 
 Back to the nineteenth of May 
 I had an open mind 
 Swore to never change 
 Funny how time goes by 
 Had respect for myself 
 That river ran dry 
 You reached a limit 
 I wasn't enough 
 It's like the fire replaced all the love 
 I've been burning 
 Yes, I've been burning 
 Such a burden 
 This flame on my chest 
 No insurance to pay for the damage 
 Yeah, I've been burning up since you left 
 Oh, have you ever called 
 I will burst straight back 
 Give you my forgiveness 
 And the shirt off my back 
 No friends to turn to 
 Yeah, I messed up that 
 Wish we could smoke again 
 Just for a day, oh 
 Funny how time goes by 
 Had respect for myself 
 That river ran dry 
 You reached a limit 
 I wasn't enough 
 And it's like the fire replaced all the love 
 I've been burning 
 Yes, I've been burning 
 Such a burden 
 This flame on my chest 
 No insurance to pay for the damage 
 Yeah, I've been burning up since you left 
 Yeah, I've been burning up since you left 
 Oh, I've been burning up since you left"
21,Sam Smith,pop,Him,"Holy Father, we need to talk 
 I have a secret, that I can't keep 
 I'm not the boy that, you thought you wanted 
 Please don't get angry, have faith in me 
 Say I shouldn't be here but I can't give up his touch 
 It is him I love, it is him 
 Don't you try and tell me that God doesn't care for us 
 It is him I love, it is him I love 
 I walk the streets of Mississippi 
 I hold my lover by the hand 
 I feel you staring when he is with me 
 How can I make you understand? 
 Say I shouldn't be here but I can't give up his touch 
 It is him I love, it is him 
 Don't you try and tell me that God doesn't care for us 
 It is him I love, it is him I love 
 Oh, oh 
 Oh, I love 
 Oh, oh 
 No, no, I love 
 Oh, oh 
 I love 
 Oh, oh 
 Oh, oh 
 Him I love 
 Oh, oh 
 Him I love 
 Oh, oh 
 Him I love 
 Oh, oh 
 Him I love 
 Holy Father, judge my sins 
 I'm not afraid of what they will bring 
 I'm not the boy that you thought you wanted 
 I love him"
22,Sam Smith,pop,"Baby, You Make Me Crazy","You say that you're leaving, but I don't think I can let go 
 When you put the phone down, I began to cry 
 What are you to do, when the person that you love just says no? 
 Boy, get yourself together, move on with your life 
 So I'm gonna play my favourite rhythm 
 Got to get you out my system 
 I would do anything to keep you off my mind 
 When I gonna have to call my sisters 
 Be around the ones who listen 
 Anything to drown you out tonight 
 Baby, you make me crazy 
 Why'd you have to fill my heart with sorrow? 
 Save me, make it all hazy 
 So I don't think about you till tomorrow 
 It wasn't enough, but you could've had the guts to face me 
 It would have meant so much, if you'd looked me in the eye 
 Why do I always fall for the ones who have no courage? 
 I must see some kind of beauty in their eyes 
 So I'm gonna play my favourite rhythm 
 Got to get you out my system 
 I would do anything to keep you off my mind 
 I'm gonna have to call my sisters 
 Be around the ones who listen 
 Anything to drown you out tonight 
 Baby, you make me crazy 
 Why'd you have to fill my heart with sorrow? 
 Save me, make it all hazy 
 So I don't think about you till tomorrow 
 Baby, you make me crazy 
 Why'd you have to fill my heart with sorrow? 
 Save me, make it all hazy 
 So I don't think about you till tomorrow

 Why'd you have to fill my heart with sorrow? 
 Save me, make it all hazy 
 So I don't think about you till tomorrow"
23,Sam Smith,pop,No Peace,"I see you in the morning, feel your fingers in my hair 
 Sometimes I still pretend you're all there 
 It hits me without warning, your reflection walking by 
 But I know it's only in my mind 
 Will you show me the piece of my heart I've been missing? 
 Won't you give me the part of myself that I can't get back? 
 Will you show me the piece of my heart I've been missing? 
 'Cause I'd kill for you, and darling you know that 
 So I'll light up a cigarette 
 I'll drink it down till there's nothing left 
 'Cause I sure can't get no sleep 
 And Lord knows there's no relief 
 You held my heart in your fingertips 
 So now I drown in my bitterness 
 Oh, I can't get no sleep 
 And I sure won't, I sure won't find no peace 
 No peace 
 All that I am asking is for a little clarity 
 That's all that really matters to me 
 In and out of focus, tears are in my eyes 
 We're burning down the bridges this time 
 Will you show me the piece of my heart I've been missing? 
 Won't you give me the part of myself that I can't give back? 
 Will you show me the piece of my heart I've been missing? 
 'Cause I'd kill for you, and darling you know that 
 So I'll light up a cigarette 
 I'll drink it down till there's nothing left

 And Lord knows there's no relief 
 You held my heart in your fingertips 
 So now I drown in my bitterness 
 Oh, I can't get no sleep 
 And I sure won't, I sure won't find 
 I used to find comfort in your arms 
 Caught up in the wonder of your charms 
 Oh, I'll cry for you, I'll cry for you 
 I'll lie for you, I'll lie for you 
 But I don't even know you anymore 
 So I'll light up a cigarette 
 I'll drink it down till there's nothing left 
 'Cause I sure can't get no sleep 
 And Lord knows there's no relief 
 You held my heart in your fingertips 
 So now I drown in my bitterness 
 Oh, I can't get no sleep 
 And I sure won't, I sure won't find no peace 
 Sure won't find no peace, no 
 Will you give me the piece 
 Will you give me the piece of my heart? 
 Will you give me the piece 
 Will you give me the piece of my heart?"
24,Sam Smith,pop,Palace,"My head is filled with ruins 
 Most of them are built with you 
 Now the dust no longer moves 
 Don't disturb the ghost of you 
 They are empty, they are worn 
 Tell me what we built this for 
 On my way to something more 
 You're that one I can't ignore 
 I'm gonna miss you 
 I still care 
 Sometimes I wish we never built this palace 
 But real love is never a waste of time 
 Yeah, I know just what you're saying 
 And I regret ever complaining 
 About this heart and all its breaking 
 It was beauty we were making 
 And I know we'll both move on 
 You'll forgive what I did wrong 
 They will love the better you 
 But I still own the ghost of you 
 I'm gonna miss you 
 I'm still there 
 Sometimes I wish we never built this palace 
 But real love is never a waste of time 
 I'm gonna miss you 
 I'm still there 
 Sometimes I wish we never built this palace 
 But real love is never a waste of time 
 But real love is never a waste of time"
25,Sam Smith,pop,Pray,"I'm young and I'm foolish, I've made bad decisions 
 I block out the news, turn my back on religion 
 Don't have no degree, I'm somewhat naive 
 I've made it this far on my own 
 But lately, that shit ain't been gettin' me higher 
 I lift up my head and the world is on fire 
 There's dread in my heart and fear in my bones 
 And I just don't know what to say 
 Maybe I'll pray, pray 
 Maybe I'll pray 
 I have never believed in you, no 
 But I'm gonna pray 
 You won't find me in church (no) reading the Bible (no) 
 I am still here and I'm still your disciple 
 I'm down on my knees, I'm beggin' you, please 
 I'm broken, alone, and afraid 
 I'm not a saint, I'm more of a sinner 
 I don't wanna lose, but I fear for the winners 
 When I tried to explain, the words ran away 
 That's why I am stood here today 
 And I'm gonna pray, pray, maybe I'll pray 
 Pray for a glimmer of hope 
 Maybe I'll pray, pray, maybe I'll pray 
 I've never believed in you, no, but I'm gonna... 
 Won't you call me? 
 Can we have a one-on-one, please? 
 Let's talk about freedom 
 Everyone prays in the end 
 Everyone prays in the end 
 Oh, won't you call me? 
 Can we have a one-on-one, please? 
 Let's talk about freedom 
 Everyone prays in the end 
 Everyone prays in the end 
 Oh, I'm gonna pray, I'm gonna pray, I'm gonna pray 
 Pray for a glimmer of hope

26,Sam Smith,pop,Nothing Left For You,"Maybe I'm done, maybe it's true 
 Maybe I had one chance and I lost it with you 
 We fell so hard, with nothing to lose 
 I'll never love again, I'll never love you 
 'Cause I gave, my heart, to a goddamn fool 
 I gave him everything 
 Now there's nothing left for you 
 'Cause I gave (I gave) 
 My heart (my heart) 
 To a goddamn fool 
 I lost everything 
 Now I have nothing left for you 
 I have nothing left for you 
 I can't pretend, pretend that I care 
 I see how you look at me, but I am not there 
 The damage is done, I'll save you the time 
 And if there are feelings there, they are not mine 
 'Cause I gave (I gave) 
 My heart (my heart) 
 To a goddamn fool 
 I gave him everything 
 Now there's nothing left for you 
 'Cause I gave (I gave) 
 My heart (my heart) 
 To a goddamn fool 
 I lost everything 
 And I have nothing left for you 
 Oh, I have nothing left for you 
 You won't hear me say those words again 
 This is something that you cannot mend 
 Can't you see I am a product of my own past? 
 So I know this will never last 
 And I will not cover your fears 
 I will not pick up your tears 
 I'll live out the rest of my days alone 
 'Cause I gave, my heart, to a goddamn fool 
 I gave him everything 
 Now there's nothing left for you 
 'Cause I gave, my heart, to a goddamn fool 
 I lost everything 
 And I have nothing left for you"
27,Sam Smith,pop,The Thrill Of It All,"I regret that I told the world 
 That you were with me 
 And I regret how I showed the world 
 That you were pretty 
 I never thought I'd learn so much 
 So much from being lonely 
 But I guess I didn't learn enough 
 'Cause now you won't hold me 
 I guess I got lost in the moment 
 I guess I got lost in the fall 
 I guess I got lost in your heartbeat 
 In the thrill of it all 
 And I guess you were goddamn perfect 
 'Cause every single time you call 
 I remind myself of what I lost that night, my love 
 In the thrill of it all 
 In the thrill of it all 
 Even though we weren't in love 
 It was far from lust 
 Yeah, you were beautiful 
 But in you I could trust 
 Others, they warned my heart 
 They said I would lose fast 
 They said that you were stopping ground 
 And soon to be my past 
 I guess I got lost in the moment 
 I guess I got lost in the fall 
 I guess I got lost in your heartbeat 
 In the thrill of it all 
 And I guess you were goddamn perfect 
 'Cause every single time you call 
 I remind myself of what I lost that night, my love 
 In the thrill of it all, oh 
 In the thrill of it all 
 And I guess you were goddamn perfect 
 'Cause every single time you call 
 I remind myself of what I lost that night, my love 
 I remind myself of what I lost that night, my love 
 I remind myself of what I lost that night, my love 
 In the thrill of it all"
28,Sam Smith,pop,Scars,"This is for my mother 
 From the older brother of your children, made of three 
 Now you found your lover 
 'Cause it wasn't our father who made you laugh and happy 
 It's been a long five years 
 I've cried a thousand tears, and here we are after the war 
 But we're so much better 
 Now the skies are clearer, now there's no more slamming doors 
 Now, I say 
 Dear Mother, how you've come so far 
 Your love has fixed all of our broken hearts 
 I hope you're proud, Mother, of what you've done 
 It's a lifelong lesson and I'm not pretending when I say 
 You cleared up my scars 
 You cleared up my scars 
 This is for my father 
 From the older brother of your children made of three 
 Yeah, you've been so good to us 
 And showed us how to live and taught us to be free 
 But when Mother told you 
 That she didn't love you, all these bridges hit the sea 
 So you built another one 
 And helped us cross it, even though you were in need 
 Now, I say 
 Dear Father, how you've come so far 
 Your love has fixed all of our broken hearts 
 I hope you're proud, Father, of what you've done 
 It's a lifelong lesson and I'm not pretending when I say 
 You cleared up my scars 
 You cleared up my scars 
 You cleared up my scars 
 You cleared up my scars 
 Dear Mother, how you've come so far 
 Your love has fixed all of our broken hearts 
 I hope you're proud, Mother, of what you've done 
 It's a lifelong lesson and I'm not pretending when I say 
 You cleared up my scars"
29,Sam Smith,pop,One Day At A Time,"Let's turn off our phones tonight 
 And rely on the stars 
 We've been so lost lately 
 We forgot who we are 
 But I got everything I need, baby 
 In the palms of your touch 
 In a world of dark distractions 
 It can all get too much 
 So let's sit by an English river 
 Till the water runs dry 
 Can we light a cigarette 
 And talk about days gone by? 
 We're neither saints or sinners 
 So leave your history behind 
 Let's grab a bottle and take it one day at a time 
 Take it one day at a time 
 I know you're feeling weighed down tonight 
 And you can't find the breaks 
 Every day is too long for you 
 You are sworn to your fate 
 But we got everything we need, baby 
 In the memories we make 
 In a world of reinventions 
 It's never too late 
 So let's sit by an English river 
 Till the water runs dry 
 Can we light a cigarette 
 And talk about days gone by? 
 We're neither saints or sinners 
 So leave your history behind 
 Let's grab a bottle and take it one day at a time 
 Take it one day at a time 
 Oh, so let's sit by an English river 
 Till the water runs dry 
 There is nothing that we've done wrong 
 That can't be made right 
 We're neither saints or sinners 
 So leave your history behind 
 Let's grab a bottle and take it 
 Grab a bottle and take it 
 Grab a bottle and take it one day at a time"
30,Sam Smith,pop,Pray (Feat. Logic),"(Logic) 
 They never knew my struggle 
 Rose above the rubble 
 Rather live inside they bubble 
 Than go through the trouble 
 Of having they double-double vision corrected 
 They just neglect it and 
 I've been thinkin' lately 
 Will the Devil take me? 
 Or will God protect me? 
 I know I ain't perfect, but you should respect me 
 They don't want me happy 
 They don't want to let me live

 I'm young and I'm foolish, I made bad decisions 
 I block out the news, turn my back on religion 
 Don't have no degree, I'm somewhat naïve

 I lift up my head and the world is on fire 
 There's dread in my heart and fear in my bones

 Maybe I'll pray, pray 
 Maybe I'll pray 
 I have never believed in you, no 
 But I'm gonna pray 
 (Logic) 
 I am me 
 I'm a man, I'm a sinner 
 But understand, aren't we all? 
 So when it comes to passin' judgements 
 I don't think that you're the one to make the call 
 Heaven want to cast me out for being me 
 I know there's others like me that'll break the fall 
 I know you hater motherfuckers just can't relate at all 
 If I'm the first one to the line, that's fine, I'll take it all 
 Well Logic, He gon' let 'em know 
 I ain't perfect, but I'm worth it 
 I'm alive, I deserve it 
 I been praying, I ain't playin' 
 I don't think you hear the words that I'm sayin' 
 I don't think you know the weight on my shoulders 
 That gets heavier as I get older 
 Callin' anybody, callin' anybody 
 ""Can you hear me?"" 
 I pray that you hear me 
 I pray that you hear me 
 (Sam Smith) 
 Maybe I'll pray (Lord), pray (Lord), maybe I'll pray 
 I've never believed in you, no, but I'm gonna...

32,Sam Smith,pop,Writing's On The Wall,"I've been here before 
 But always hit the floor 
 I've spent a lifetime running 
 And I always get away 
 But with you I'm feeling something 
 That makes me want to stay 
 I'm prepared for this 
 I never shoot to miss 
 But I feel like a storm is coming 
 If I'm gonna make it through the day 
 Then there's no more use in running 
 This is something I gotta face 
 If I risk it all 
 Could you break my fall? 
 How do I live? How do I breathe? 
 When you're not here I'm suffocating 
 I want to feel love, run through my blood 
 Tell me is this where I give it all up? 
 For you I have to risk it all 
 'Cause the writing's on the wall 
 A million shards of glass 
 That haunt me from my past 
 As the stars begin to gather 
 And the light begins to fade 
 When all hope begins to shatter 
 Know that I won't be afraid 
 If I risk it all 
 Could you break my fall? 
 How do I live? How do I breathe? 
 When you're not here I'm suffocating 
 I want to feel love, run through my blood 
 Tell me is this where I give it all up? 
 For you I have to risk it all 
 'Cause the writing's on the wall 
 The writing's on the wall 
 How do I live? How do I breathe? 
 When you're not here I'm suffocating 
 I want to feel love, run through my blood 
 Tell me is this where I give it all up? 
 How do I live? How do I breathe? 
 When you're not here I'm suffocating 
 I want to feel love, run through my blood 
 Tell me is this where I give it all up? 
 For you I have to risk it all 
 'Cause the writing's on the wall"
