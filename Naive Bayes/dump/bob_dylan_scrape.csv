0,Bob Dylan,rock,You're No Good,"Well, I don't know why I love you like I do 
 Nobody in the world can get along with you 
 You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den 
 I come home last night, you wouldn't even let me in 
 Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody want to be 
 When you get a crazy notion jumpin' all over me 
 Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied 
 An' you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die 
 I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama 
 I helped you when you had no food to eat 
 You're the kind of woman I just don't understand 
 You're takin' all my money and give it to another man 
 Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains 
 You're the kinda woman drives a man insane 
 You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied 
 You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die 
 Well, you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die"
1,Bob Dylan,rock,Talkin' New York,"Ramblin' out of the wild West 
 Leavin' the towns I love the best 
 Thought I'd seen some ups and down 
 'Til I come into New York town 
 People goin' down to the ground 
 Buildings goin' up to the sky 
 Wintertime in New York town 
 The wind blowin' snow around 
 Walk around with nowhere to go 
 Somebody could freeze right to the bone 
 I froze right to the bone 
 New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years 
 I didn't feel so cold then 
 I swung on to my old guitar 
 Grabbed hold of a subway car 
 And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride 
 I landed up on the downtown side 
 Greenwich Village 
 I walked down there and ended up 
 In one of them coffeehouses on the block 
 I get on the the stage to sing and play 
 Man there said: Come back some other day 
 You sound like a hillbilly 
 We want folk singers here 
 Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play 
 Blowin' my lungs out for a dollar a day 
 I blowed inside out and upside down 
 The man there said he loved m'sound 
 He was ravin' about how he loved my sound 
 Dollar a day's worth 
 And after weeks and weeks of hangin' around 
 I finally got a job in New York town 
 In a bigger place, bigger money, too 
 Even joined the union and paid my dues 
 Now, a very great man once said 
 That some people rob you with a fountain pen 
 It don't take too long to find out 
 Just what he was talkin' about 
 A lot of people don't have much food on their table 
 But they got a lot of forks and knives 
 And they gotta cut somethin' 
 So one mornin', when the sun was warm 
 I rambled out of New York town 
 Pulled my cap down over my eyes 
 And headed out for the western skies 
 So long, New York 
 Howdy, East Orange"
2,Bob Dylan,rock,In My Time Of Dyin',"Well, in my time of dyin' 
 Don't want nobody to mourn 
 All I want for you to do is 
 Take my body home, well, well, well 
 So I can die easy 
 Well, well well 
 Well, well, well 
 So I can die easy 
 Jesus gonna make up, Jesus gonna make up 
 Jesus gonna make up my dying bed 
 Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me 
 Meet me in the middle of the air 
 If these wings should fail me, Lord 
 Won't you meet me with another pair 
 Well, well, well 
 So I can die easy 
 Well, well well 
 Well, well, well 
 So I can die easy 
 Jesus gonna make up, Jesus gonna make up 
 Jesus gonna make up my dying bed 
 Lord, in my time of dying 
 Don't want nobody to cry 
 All I want you to do is 
 Take me when I die 
 Well, well, well 
 So I can die easy 
 Well, well well 
 Well, well, well 
 So I can die easy 
 Jesus gonna make up, Jesus gonna make up 
 Jesus gonna make up my dying bed"
3,Bob Dylan,rock,Man Of Constant Sorrow,"I am a man of constant sorrow 
 I've seen trouble all my days 
 I'll say goodbye to Colorado 
 Where I was born and partly raised 
 Your mother says that I'm a stranger 
 My face you'll never see no more 
 But there's one promise, darling 
 I'll see you on God's golden shore 
 Through this open world, I'm about to ramble 
 Through ice and snow, sleet and rain 
 I'm about to ride that mornin' railroad 
 Perhaps I'll die on that train 
 I'm going back to Colorado 
 The place that I started from 
 If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me 
 Honey, I never would have come"
4,Bob Dylan,rock,Fixin' To Die,"Feeling funny in my mind, Lord 
 I believe I'm fixing to die 
 Feeling funny in my mind, Lord 
 I believe I'm fixing to die 
 Well, I don't mind dying 
 But I hate to leave my children crying 
 Well, I look over yonder to that burying ground 
 Look over yonder to that burying ground 
 Sure seems lonesome, Lord, when the sun goes down 
 Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord 
 I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die 
 Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord 
 I believe I'm fixing to die 
 Well, I don't mind dying but 
 I hate to leave my children crying 
 There's a black smoke rising, Lord 
 It's rising up above my head, up above my head 
 It's rising up above my head, up above my head 
 And tell Jesus make up my dying bed 
 I'm walking kind of funny, Lord 
 I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die 
 Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord 
 I believe I'm fixing to die 
 Fixing to die, fixing to die 
 Well, I don't mind dying 
 But I hate to leave my children crying"
5,Bob Dylan,rock,Pretty Peggy-O,"I've been around this whole country 
 But I never yet found Fennario. 
 Well, as we marched down 
 As we marched down 
 Well, as we marched down to Fennario 
 Well, our captain fell in love 
 With a lady like a dove 
 Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O 
 Well, what will your mother say 
 What will your mother say 
 What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O 
 What will your mother say 
 To know you're going away 
 You're never, never, never coming back-io? 
 Come a-running down your stairs 
 Come a-running down your stairs 
 Come a-running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O 
 Come a-running down your stairs 
 Comb back your yellow hair 
 You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-io. 
 The lieutenant he has gone 
 The lieutenant he has gone 
 The lieutenant he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O 
 The lieutenant he has gone 
 Long gone 
 He's a-riding down in Texas with the rodeo. 
 Well, our captain he is dead 
 Our captain he is dead 
 Our captain he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O 
 Well, our captain he is dead 
 Died for a maid 
 He's buried somewheres in Louisiana-O."
6,Bob Dylan,rock,Highway 51,"Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door 
 Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door 
 If I don't get the girl I'm loving 
 Won't go down to Highway 51 no more 
 Well, I know that highway like I know my hand 
 Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand 
 Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land 
 Well, if I should die before my time should come 
 And if I die before my time should come 
 Won't you bury my body out on the Highway 51 
 Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door 
 I said, Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door 
 If I don't get the girl I'm loving 
 Won't go own to Highway 51 no more"
7,Bob Dylan,rock,Gospel Plow,"Mary wore three links of chain 
 Every link was Jesus name 
 Keep your hand on that plow, hold on 
 Oh, Lord, oh, Lord 
 Keep your hand on that plow, hold on 
 Mary, Mark and Luke and John 
 All them prophets are dead and gone 
 Keep your hand on that plow, hold on

 Streets up there are lined with gold 
 Keep your hand on that plow, hold on

8,Bob Dylan,rock,"Baby, Let Me Follow You Down","I first heard this Rick von Schmidt. 
 He lives in Cambridge. 
 Rick's a blues guitar player. 
 I met him one day in the green pastures of uh, Harvard University. 
 Baby, let me follow you down 
 Baby, let me follow you down 
 Well, I'd do anything in this god almighty world 
 If you just let me follow you down 
 Can I come home with you? 
 Baby, can I come home with you?

9,Bob Dylan,rock,House Of The Rising Sun,"There is a house in New Orleans 
 They call the Rising Sun 
 It's been the ruin of many a-poor girl 
 And me, oh God, I'm one 
 My mother was a tailor 
 She sewed my new blue jeans 
 My sweetheart was a gambler 
 Down in New Orleans 
 Now the only thing a gambler needs 
 Is a suitcase and a trunk 
 And the only time he's satisfied 
 Is when he's on a drunk 
 He fills his glasses up to the brim 
 And he'll pass the cards around 
 And the only pleasure he gets out of life 
 Is ramblin' from town to town 
 Oh tell my baby sister 
 Not to do what I have done 
 But shun that house in New Orleans 
 They call the Rising Sun 
 Well it's one foot on the platform 
 The other foot on the train 
 I'm goin' back to New Orleans 
 To wear that ball and chain 
 I'm a goin' back to New Orleans 
 My race is almost run 
 I'm goin' back to end my life 
 Down in the Rising Sun 
 There is a house in New Orleans 
 They call the Rising Sun 
 It's been the ruin of many a-poor girl 
 And me, oh God, I'm one"
10,Bob Dylan,rock,Freight Train Blues,"I was born in Dixie in a boomer shed 
 Just a little shanty by the railroad track 
 Freight train was it taught me how to cry 
 The holler of the driver was my lullaby 
 I got the freight train blues 
 Oh Lord mama, I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes 
 And when the whistle blows I gotta go baby, don't you know 
 Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues. 
 Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama-ha 
 She was the only daugther of an enginer 
 My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke 
 Seems a waste to get a good man broke 
 I got the freight train blues 
 Oh Lord mama, I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes 
 And when the whistle blows I gotta go mama, don't you know 
 Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues. 
 Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again 
 Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train 
 Every place I wanna go I never can go 
 Because you know I got the freight train blues 
 Oh Lord mama, I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes"
11,Bob Dylan,rock,Song To Woody,"I'm out here a thousand miles from my home, 
 Walkin' a road other men have gone down. 
 I'm seein' your world of people and things, 
 Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings. 
 Hey, hey Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song 
 'Bout a funny ol' world that's a-comin' along. 
 Seems sick an' it's hungry, it's tired an' it's torn, 
 It looks like it's a-dyin' an' it's hardly been born. 
 Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know 
 All the things that I'm a-sayin' an' a-many times more. 
 I'm a-singin' you this song, but I can't sing enough, 
 'Cause there's not many men that done the things that you've done. 
 Here's to Cisco and Sonny and Leadbelly too, 
 An' to all the good people that traveled with you. 
 Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men 
 That come with the dust and are gone with the wind. 
 I'm a-leavin' tomorrow, but I could leave today, 
 Somewhere down the road someday. 
 The very last thing that I'd want to do 
 Is to say I've been hittin' some hard travelin' too."
12,Bob Dylan,rock,See That My Grave Is Kept Clean,"Well there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you 
 Well there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you 
 There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you 
 You can see that my grave is kept clean. 
 And there's two white horses following me 
 And there's two white horses following me 
 I got two white horses following me 
 Waiting on my burying ground. 
 Did you ever hear that coughin' sound 
 Did you ever hear that coughin' sound 
 Did you ever hear that coughin' sound 
 Means another poor boy is underground. 
 Did you ever hear them church bells toll 
 Did you ever hear them church bells toll 
 Did you ever hear them church bells toll 
 Means another poor boy is dead and gone. 
 And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold 
 And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold 
 And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold 
 Now I believe what the Bible told. 
 There's just one last favor I'll ask of you 
 And there's one last favor I'll ask of you 
 There's just one last favor I'll ask of you 
 See that my grave is kept clean."
13,Bob Dylan,rock,Blowin' In The Wind,"How many roads must a man walk down 
 Before you call him a man? 
 How many seas must the white dove sail 
 Before she sleeps in the sand? 
 Yes, and how many times must the cannonballs fly 
 Before they are forever banned? 
 The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind 
 The answer is blowin' in the wind 
 Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist 
 Before it is washed to the sea? 
 Yes, and how many years can some people exist 
 Before they're allowed to be free? 
 Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head 
 And pretend that he just doesn't see? 
 The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind 
 The answer is blowin' in the wind 
 Yes, and how many times must a man look up 
 Before he can see the sky? 
 Yes, and how many ears must one man have 
 Before he can hear people cry? 
 Yes, and how many deaths will it take 'til he knows 
 That too many people have died? 
 The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind 
 The answer is blowin' in the wind"
14,Bob Dylan,rock,Girl From The North Country,"If you're traveling in the north country fair 
 Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline 
 Remember me to the one who lives there 
 For she once was a true love of mine 
 If you go when the snowflakes storm 
 When the rivers freeze and summer ends 
 Please see if she has a coat so warm 
 To keep her from the howling winds 
 Please see if her hair hangs long 
 If it rolls and flows all down her breast 
 Please see from me if her hair is hanging long 
 For that's the way I remember her best 
 I'm wondering if she remembers me at all 
 So many times I've thought and prayed 
 In the darkness of my night 
 And the brightness of my days 
 So if you're traveling in the north country fair 
 Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline 
 Remember me to the one who lives there 
 For she once was a true love of mine"
15,Bob Dylan,rock,Masters Of War,"Come, you masters of war 
 You that build the big guns 
 You that build the death planes 
 You that build all the bombs 
 You that hide behind walls 
 You that hide behind desks 
 I just want you to know I can see through your masks 
 You that never done nothin' 
 But build to destroy 
 You play with my world 
 Like it's your little toy 
 You put a gun in my hand 
 And you hide from my eyes 
 And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly 
 Like Judas of old 
 You lie and deceive 
 A world war can be won 
 You want me to believe 
 But I see through your eyes 
 And I see through your brain 
 Like I see through the water that runs down my drain 
 You fasten all the triggers 
 For the others to fire 
 Then you sit back and watch 
 While the death count gets higher 
 You hide in your mansion 
 While the young peoples' blood 
 Flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud 
 You've thrown the worst fear 
 That can ever be hurled 
 Fear to bring children 
 Into the world 
 For threatenin' my baby 
 Unborn and unnamed 
 You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins 
 How much do I know 
 To talk out of turn? 
 You might say that I'm young 
 You might say I'm unlearned 
 But there's one thing I know 
 Though I'm younger than you 
 That even Jesus would never forgive what you do 
 Let me ask you one question 
 Is your money that good? 
 Will it buy you forgiveness? 
 Do you think that it could? 
 I think you will find 
 When your death takes its toll 
 All the money you made will never buy back your soul 
 And I hope that you die 
 And your death will come soon 
 I'll follow your casket 
 On a pale afternoon 
 I'll watch while you're lowered 
 Down to your deathbed 
 And I'll stand over your grave till I'm sure that you're dead"
16,Bob Dylan,rock,Down The Highway,"Well, I'm walkin' down the highway 
 With my suitcase in my hand 
 Yes, I'm walkin' down the highway 
 With my suitcase in my hand 
 Lord, I really miss my baby 
 She's in some foreign land 
 Well, your streets are gettin' empty 
 Lord, your highway's gettin' filled 
 And your streets are gettin' empty 
 And your highway's gettin' filled 
 Well, the way I love that woman 
 I swear it's bound to get me killed 
 Well, I been gamblin' so long 
 Lord, I ain't got much more to lose 
 Yes, I been gamblin' so long, Lord 
 I ain't got much more to lose 
 Right now I'm havin' trouble 
 Please don't take away my highway shoes 
 Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby 
 Or I'm bound to die tryin' 
 Yes, I'm a-bound to get lucky, baby 
 Lord, Lord, I'm a-bound to die tryin' 
 Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean 
 And we'll leave this old highway behind 
 Well, the ocean took my baby 
 My baby stole my heart from me 
 Yes, the ocean took my baby 
 My baby took my heart from me 
 She packed it all up in a suitcase 
 Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy 
 So I'm a-walkin' down your highway 
 Just as far as my poor eyes can see 
 Yes, I'm a-walkin' down your highway 
 Just as far as my eyes can see 
 From the Golden Gate Bridge 
 All the way to the Statue of Liberty"
17,Bob Dylan,rock,Bob Dylan's Blues,"Unlike most of the songs nowadays that are being written uptown in Tin Pan Alley 
 That's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays 
 This, this is a song, this wasn't written up there 
 This was written somewhere down in the United States 
 Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were ridin' down the line 
 Fixin' everybody's troubles, everybody's 'cept mine 
 Someone must've told 'em that I was doin' fine 
 Oh, you five and ten cent women there's nothin' in your heads 
 I got a real gal I'm in love with, Lord, I'll love her till I'm dead 
 Go away from my door and my window too right now 
 Lord, I ain't goin' down to no racetrack to see no sports car run 
 I don't have no sports car and I don't even care to have one 
 I can walk anytime around the block 
 Well, the wind keeps a-blowin' me up and down the street 
 With my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet 
 Watch out so you don't step on me, on me 
 Well, look it here, buddy, you want to be like me 
 Pull your your six-shooter and rob every bank you see 
 Tell the judge I said it was all right, yeah"
18,Bob Dylan,rock,A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall,"Oh, where have you been 
 My blue-eyed son? 
 And where have you been 
 My darling young one? 
 I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains 
 I've walked and I crawled on six crooked highways 
 I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests 
 I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans 
 I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard 
 And it's a hard, it's a hard 
 It's a hard, it's a hard 
 It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall 
 Oh, what did you see 
 My blue-eyed son? 
 And what did you see 
 My darling young one? 
 I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it 
 I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it 
 I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin' 
 I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin' 
 I saw a white ladder all covered with water 
 I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken 
 I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children 
 And it's a hard, it's a hard 
 It's a hard, and it's a hard 
 It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall 
 And what did you hear 
 My blue-eyed son? 
 And what did you hear 
 My darling young one? 
 I heard the sound of the thunder that roared out a warning 
 I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world 
 I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin' 
 I heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin' 
 I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin' 
 I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter 
 I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley 
 And it's a hard, it's a hard 
 It's a hard, it's a hard 
 It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall 
 Oh, what did you meet 
 My blue-eyed son? 
 And who did you meet 
 My darling young one? 
 I met a young child beside a dead pony 
 I met a white man who walked a black dog 
 I met a young woman, her body was burning 
 I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow 
 I met one man who was wounded in love 
 I met another man who was wounded in hatred 
 And it's a hard, it's a hard 
 It's a hard, it's a hard 
 It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall 
 And what'll you do now 
 My blue-eyed son? 
 And what'll you do now 
 My darling young one? 
 I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin' 
 I'll walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest 
 Where the people are many and their hands are all empty 
 Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters 
 Where their home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison 
 And the executioner's face is always well-hidden 
 Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten 
 Where black is the color, where none is the number 
 And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it 
 And reflect from the mountains so all souls can see it 
 And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin' 
 But I'll know my song well before I start singing 
 And it's a hard, it's a hard 
 It's a hard, and it's a hard 
 It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall"
19,Bob Dylan,rock,"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right","Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe 
 If'n you don't know by now 
 And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe 
 It'll never do somehow 
 When your rooster crows at the break of dawn 
 Look out your window and I'll be gone 
 You're the reason I'm a-travellin' on 
 But don't think twice, it's all right 
 And it ain't no use in a-turnin' on your light, babe 
 The light I never knowed 
 And it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe 
 I'm on the dark side of the road 
 But I wish there was something you would do or say 
 To try and make me change my mind and stay 
 But we never did too much talkin' anyway 
 But don't think twice, it's all right 
 So it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal 
 Like you never done before 
 And it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal 
 I can't hear you anymore 
 I'm a-thinkin' and a-wonderin', walkin' down the road 
 I once loved a woman, a child I am told 
 I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul 
 But don't think twice, it's all right 
 So long, honey babe 
 Where I'm bound, I can't tell 
 And goodbye's too good a word, babe 
 So I'll just say fare thee well 
 I ain't a-sayin' you treated me unkind 
 You coulda done better, but I don't mind 
 You just kind of wasted my precious time 
 But don't think twice, it's all right"
20,Bob Dylan,rock,Bob Dylan's Dream,"While riding on a train goin' west 
 I fell asleep for to take my rest 
 I dreamed a dream that made me sad 
 Concerning myself and the first few friends I had 
 With half-damp eyes I stared to the room 
 Where my friends and I had spent many an afternoon 
 Where we together weathered many a storm 
 Laughin' and singin' 'til the early hours of the morn' 
 By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung 
 Our words was told, our songs was sung 
 Where we longed for nothin' and were satisfied 
 Jokin' and talkin' about the world outside 
 With hungry hearts through the heat and cold 
 We never much thought we could get very old 
 We thought we could sit forever in fun 
 Our chances really was a million to one 
 As easy it was to tell black from white 
 It was all that easy to tell wrong from right 
 And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit 
 That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split 
 Now many a year has passed and gone 
 Many a gamble has been lost and won 
 And many a road taken by many a first friend 
 And each one I've never seen again 
 I wish, I wish, I wish in vain 
 That we could sit simply in that room again 
 Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat 
 I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that"
21,Bob Dylan,rock,Oxford Town,"Oxford town, Oxford town 
 Everybody's got their heads bowed down 
 Sun don't shine above the ground 
 Ain't a-goin' down to Oxford town 
 He went down to Oxford town 
 Guns and clubs followed him down 
 All because his face was brown 
 Better get away from Oxford town 
 Oxford town around the bend 
 Come to the door, he couldn't get in 
 All because of the color of his skin 
 What do you think about that, my friend? 
 Me, my gal, and my gal's son 
 We got met with a tear gas bomb 
 Don't even know why we come 
 We're goin' back where we come from 
 Oxford town in the afternoon 
 Everybody's singin' a sorrowful tune 
 Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon 
 Somebody better investigate soon"
22,Bob Dylan,rock,Talkin' World War III Blues,"One time ago a crazy dream came to me 
 I dreamt I was walkin' into World War III 
 Went to the doctor the very next day 
 To see what kinda words he could say, said it was a bad dream 
 ""I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though, them old dreams are only in your head"" 
 I said, ""Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain"" 
 He said, ""Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane"" 
 He grabbed my arm, I said, ""Ouch"" 
 As I landed on the psychiatric couch, said, ""Tell me about it"" 
 Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast 
 It was all over by quarter past 
 I was down in the sewer with some little lover 
 When I peeked out from a manhole cover 
 Wonderin' who turned the lights on us 
 Well, I got up and walked around 
 Up and down the lonesome town 
 I stood a-wondering which way to go 
 I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road 
 It was a normal day 
 Well, I rung me a fallout shelter bell 
 And I leaned my head and I give a yell 
 ""Gimme a string bean, I'm a hungry man"" 
 A shotgun fired and away I ran 
 I don't blame them too much though, they didn't know me 
 Down the corner by the hot-dog stand, I seen a man 
 I said, ""Howdy friend, I guess it's just us two"" 
 He screamed a bit and away he flew 
 Thought I was a communist 
 Well I spied a girl and before she could leave 
 I said, ""Let's go and play Adam and Eve"" 
 I took her by the hand and my heart it was thumpin' 
 She said, ""Hey man, you crazy or somethin'? 
 You see what happened last time they started"" 
 Well, I seen a Cadillac window uptown 
 There was nobody around 
 I got into the driver's seat 
 And I drove 42nd Street in my Cadillac 
 Good car to drive after a war 
 Well, I remember seein' some ad 
 So I turned on my Conelrad 
 But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill 
 So the radio didn't work so well 
 Turned on my record-player 
 It was ""Rock-A-Day Johnny,"" singing 
 ""Tell Your Ma, Tell Your Pa 
 Our Love's a-Gonna Grow Ooh-wah, Ooh-wah"" 
 I was feelin' kinda lonesome and blue 
 And I needed somebody to talk to 
 So I called up the operator of time 
 Just to hear a voice of some kind 
 ""When you hear the beep, it will be three o'clock"" 
 She said that for over an hour and I hung up 
 Well the doctor interrupted me just about then 
 Sayin', ""Hey, I've been havin' the same old dreams 
 But mine was a little different, you see 
 I dreamt that the only person left after the war was me 
 I didn't see you around"" 
 Well, now time passed and now it seems everybody's having them dreams 
 Everybody sees theirself 
 Walkin' around with no one else 
 Half of the people can be part-right all of the time 
 Some of the people can be all right part of the time 
 But all the people can't be all right all the time 
 I think Abraham Lincoln said that 
 ""I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours,"" I said that"
23,Bob Dylan,rock,"Corrina, Corrina","Corrina, Corrina 
 Gal, where you been so long? 
 Corrina, Corrina 
 Gal, where you been so long? 
 I been worryin' about you, baby 
 Baby, please come home 
 I got a bird that whistles 
 I got a bird that sings 
 I got a bird that whistles 
 I got a bird that sings 
 But I ain't a-got Corrina 
 Life don't mean a thing 
 Corrina, Corrina 
 Gal, you're on my mind 
 Corrina, Corrina 
 Gal, you're all on my mind 
 I was sittin' down thinkin' of you 
 I just can't keep from crying"
24,Bob Dylan,rock,"Honey, Just Allow Me One More Chance","Honey, just allow me one more chance 
 To get along with you 
 Honey, just allow me one more chance 
 I'll do anything for you 
 Well, I'm a-walkin' down the road with my head in my hand 
 I'm lookin' for a woman needs a worried man 
 Just-a one kind favor I ask you 
 Allow me just one more chance 
 Honey, just allow me one more chance 
 To ride your aeroplane 
 Honey, just allow me one more chance 
 To ride your passenger train 
 Well, I've been lookin' all over for a gal like you 
 I can't find nobody, so you'll have to do 
 There's just one kind favor I'll ask you 
 Allow me just one more chance 
 Honey, just allow me one more chance 
 To get along with you 
 Honey, just allow me one more chance 
 I'll do anything for you 
 Well, lookin' for a woman that ain't got no man 
 Is just lookin' for a needle that is lost in the sand 
 Just one kind favor I ask you 
 Allow me just one more chance"
25,Bob Dylan,rock,I Shall Be Free,"Well, I took me a woman late last night 
 I's three-fourths drunk, she looked alright 
 'Til she started peelin' off her onion-gook 
 She took off her wig, an' said, ""How do I look?"" 
 I was high-flyin' 
 Bare-naked 
 Out the window 
 Well, sometimes I might get drunk 
 Walk like a duck and smell like a skunk 
 Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride 
 'Cause I got my little lady right by my side 
 She's-a tryin' to hide 
 Pretendin' she don't know me 
 I's out there paintin' on the old woodshed 
 When a can of black paint it fell on my head 
 I went down to scrub and rub 
 But I had to sit in back of the tub 
 Cost a quarter 
 Half-price 
 Well, my telephone rang, it would not stop 
 It's President Kennedy callin' me up 
 He said, ""My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"" 
 I said, ""My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot 
 Anita Ekberg 
 Sophia Loren."" 
 Country'll grow 
 Well, I got a woman four feet short 
 She yells and hollers and screams and snorts 
 She tickles my nose pats me on the head 
 Rolls me over and kicks me outta bed 
 She's a man-eater 
 Meat-grinder 
 Bad loser 
 Oh, there ain't no use in me workin' all the time 
 I got a woman who works herself blind 
 Works up to her britches, up to her neck 
 Writes me letters and sends me checks 
 She's a humdinger 
 Folk singer 
 Late one day in the middle of the week 
 Eyes were closed, I was half asleep 
 I chased me a woman up the hill 
 Right in the middle of an air raid drill 
 I jumped the fallout shelter 
 I jumped the string-bean 
 I jumped the TV dinner 
 I jumped the shotgun 
 Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote 
 He's a-runnin' for office on a ballot note 
 He's out there preachin' in front of the steeple 
 Tellin' me he loves all kinds of people 
 He's eatin' bagels 
 He's eatin' pizza 
 He's eatin' chitlins 
 Oh, I set me down on the television floor 
 I flipped the channel on to number four 
 Out of the shower comes a football man 
 With a bottle of oil in his hand 
 Greasy kid stuff 
 But what I want to know, Mr. Football Man 
 Is what do you do about Willy Mays? 
 Martin Luther King, Oula Tunjee? 
 Well, the funniest woman I ever seen 
 Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean 
 She takes about fifteen baths a day 
 Wants me to grow a mustache on my face, she's insane 
 Well, ya ask me why I'm drunk all the time 
 It levels my head and eases my mind 
 I just walk along and stroll and sing 
 I'll see better days and I'll do better things 
 I'll catch dinosaurs 
 Make love to Elizabeth Taylor 
 Catch hell from Richard Burton"
26,Bob Dylan,rock,The Times They Are A-Changin',"Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam 
 And admit that the waters around you have grown 
 And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone 
 If your time to you is worth savin' 
 Then you better start swimmin' or you'll sink like a stone 
 For the times they are a-changin' 
 Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen 
 And keep your eyes wide, the chance won't come again 
 And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin 
 And there's no tellin' who that it's namin' 
 For the loser now will be later to win 
 For the times they are a-changin' 
 Come senators, congressmen, please, heed the call 
 Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall 
 For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled 
 The battle outside ragin' 
 Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls 
 For the times they are a-changin' 
 Come mothers and fathers throughout the land 
 And don't criticize what you can't understand 
 Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command 
 Your old road is rapidly agin' 
 Please, get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand 
 For the times they are a-changin' 
 The line it is drawn, the curse it is cast 
 The slow one now will later be fast 
 As the present now will later be past 
 The order is rapidly fadin' 
 And the first one now will later be last 
 For the times they are a-changin'"
27,Bob Dylan,rock,Ballad Of Hollis Brown,"Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town 
 Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town 
 With his wife and five children and his cabin broken down 
 You looked for work and money and you walked a ragged mile 
 You looked for work and money and you walked a ragged mile 
 Your children are so hungry that they don't know how to smile 
 Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're a-tuggin' at your sleeve 
 Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're a-tuggin' at your sleeve 
 You walk the floor and wonder why with every breath you breathe 
 The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare 
 The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare 
 If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares? 
 You prayed to the Lord above, oh please send you a friend 
 You prayed to the Lord above, oh please send you a friend 
 Your empty pockets tell you that you ain't a-got no friend 
 Your baby's a-cryin' louder now, it's a-poundin' on your brain 
 Your baby's a-cryin' louder now, it's a-poundin' on your brain 
 Your wife screams are stabbing you like the dirty driving rain 
 Your grass is turnin' black, there's no water in your well 
 Your grass is turnin' black, there's no water in your well 
 You spent your last lone dollar on seven shotgun shells 
 Way out in the wilderness, a cold coyote calls 
 Way out in the wilderness, a cold coyote calls 
 Your eyes fix on a shotgun that's hangin' on the wall 
 Your brain is a-bleedin' and your legs can't seem to stand 
 Your brain is a-bleedin' and your legs can't seem to stand 
 Your eyes fix on a shotgun that you're holdin' in your hand 
 There's seven breezes blowin' all around the cabin door 
 There's seven breezes blowin' all around the cabin door 
 Seven shots ring out like the ocean's pounding roar 
 There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm 
 There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm 
 Somewhere in the distance there's seven new people born"
28,Bob Dylan,rock,With God On Our Side,"Oh, my name, it ain't nothin', my age, it means less 
 The country I come from is called the Midwest 
 I's taught and brought up there, the laws to abide 
 And that the land that I live in has God on its side 
 Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well 
 The cavalries charged, the Indians fell 
 The cavalries charged, the Indians died 
 Oh, the country was young with God on its side 
 The Spanish-American War had its day 
 And the Civil War too was soon laid away 
 And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize 
 With guns in their hands and God on their side 
 The First World War, boys, it came and it went 
 The reason for fighting I never did get 
 But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride 
 For you don't count the dead when God's on your side 
 The Second World War came to an end 
 We forgave the Germans and then we were friends 
 Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried 
 The Germans now too have God on their side 
 I learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life 
 If another war comes, it's them we must fight 
 To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide 
 And accept it all bravely with God on my side 
 But now we got weapons of chemical dust 
 If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must 
 One push of the button and a shot the world wide 
 You never ask questions when God's on your side 
 Through many a dark hour I been thinkin' about this 
 That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss 
 But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide 
 Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side 
 So now as I'm leavin', I'm weary as hell 
 The confusion I'm feelin' ain't no tongue can tell 
 The words fill my head and they fall to the floor 
 That if God's on our side, he'll stop the next war"
29,Bob Dylan,rock,One Too Many Mornings,"Down the street the dogs are barkin' and the day is gettin' dark 
 As the night comes in a-fallin' the dogs will lose their bark 
 And the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind 
 For I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind 
 From the crossroads of my doorstep, my eyes, they start to fade 
 As I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid 
 And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign 
 And I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind 
 It's a restless hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good 
 When everything I'm a-sayin', you can say it just as good 
 You're right from your side, I am right from mine 
 We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind"
30,Bob Dylan,rock,North Country Blues,"Come gather 'round friends, and I'll tell you a tale 
 Of when the red iron ore pits ran plenty 
 But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches 
 Tell you now that the whole town is empty 
 In the north end of town, my own children have grown 
 But I was raised on the other 
 In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick 
 And I was brought up by my brother 
 The iron ore poured as the years passed the door 
 The drag lines and shovels, they was humming 
 'Til one day my brother failed to come home 
 The same as my father before him 
 Well, a long winter's wait from the window, I watched 
 My friends, they couldn't have been kinder 
 And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring 
 To marry John Thomas, a miner 
 Oh, the years passed again and the givin' was good 
 With a lunch bucket filled every season 
 But with three babies born, the work was cut down 
 To a half a day's shift with no reason 
 And the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut 
 And the fire in the air, it felt frozen 
 'Til a man come to speak and he said in one week 
 That number eleven was closing 
 They complained in the east, they are paying too high 
 They say that your ore ain't worth diggin' 
 That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns 
 Where the miners work almost for nothin' 
 So the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted 
 And the room smelled heavy from drinkin' 
 And the sad silent song made the hour twice as long 
 As I waited for the sun to go sinkin' 
 I lived by the window as he talked to himself 
 This silence of tongues, it was building 
 'Til one morning's wake, the bed, it was bare 
 And I was left alone with three children 
 The summer is gone, the ground's turning cold 
 The stores one by one, they're a-foldin' 
 My children will go as soon as they grow 
 Well, there ain't nothin' here now to hold them"
31,Bob Dylan,rock,Only A Pawn In Their Game,"A bullet from the back of a bush 
 Took Medgar Evers' blood 
 A finger fired the trigger to his name 
 A handle hid out in the dark, a hand set the spark 
 Two eyes took the aim, behind a man's brain 
 But he can't be blamed 
 He's only a pawn in their game 
 A South politician preaches to the poor white man 
 ""You got more than the blacks, don't complain 
 You're better than them, you been born with white skin"" 
 They explain 
 And the Negro's name is used, it is plain 
 For the politician's gain as he rises to fame 
 And the poor white remains on the caboose of the train 
 But it ain't him to blame, he's only a pawn in their game 
 The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid 
 And the marshals and cops get the same 
 But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool 
 He's taught in his school from the start, by the rule 
 That the laws are with him, to protect his white skin 
 To keep up his hate, so he never thinks straight 'bout the shape that he's in 
 But it ain't him to blame, he's only a pawn in their game 
 From the poverty shacks he looks from the cracks to the tracks 
 And the hoof beats pound in his brain 
 And he's taught how to walk in a pack, shoot in the back 
 With his fist in a clinch 
 To hang and to lynch, to hide 'neath a hood 
 To kill with no pain like a dog on a chain 
 He ain't got no name, but it ain't him to blame 
 He's only a pawn in their game 
 Today Medger Evers was buried from the bullet he caught 
 They lowered him down as a king 
 But when the shadowy sun sets on the one 
 That fired the gun 
 You'll see by his grave 
 On the stone that remains 
 Carved next to his name, his epitaph plain 
 ""Only a pawn in their game"""
32,Bob Dylan,rock,Boots Of Spanish Leather,"Oh, I'm sailin' away, my own true love 
 I'm sailin' away in the morning 
 Is there something I can send you from across the sea 
 From the place that I'll be landing? 
 No, there's nothin' you can send me, my own true love 
 There's nothin' I'm wishin' to be ownin' 
 Just a-carry yourself back to me unspoiled 
 From across that lonesome ocean 
 Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine 
 Made of silver or of golden 
 Either from the mountains of Madrid 
 Or from the coast of Barcelona 
 If I had the stars of the darkest night 
 And the diamonds from the deepest ocean 
 I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss 
 For that's all I'm wishin' to be ownin' 
 That I might be gone a long old time 
 And it's only that I'm askin' 
 Is there something I can send you to remember me by 
 To make your time more easy passin'? 
 Oh, how can, how can you ask me again? 
 It only brings me sorrow 
 The same thing I would want today 
 I will want again tomorrow 
 Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day 
 It was from her ship a-sailin' 
 Saying ""I don't know when I'll be comin' back again 
 It depends on how I'm a-feelin'"" 
 If you, my love, must think that-a-way 
 I'm sure your mind is a-roamin' 
 I'm sure your thoughts are not with me 
 But with the country to where you're goin' 
 So take heed, take heed of the western winds 
 Take heed of the stormy weather 
 And yes, there's something you can send back to me 
 Spanish boots of Spanish leather"
33,Bob Dylan,rock,When The Ship Comes In,"Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop 
 And the breeze will cease to be breathin' 
 Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins 
 The hour that the ship comes in 
 And the sea will split and the ships will hit 
 And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking 
 And the tide will sound and the waves will pound 
 And the morning will be a-breaking 
 The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path 
 And the seagulls, they'll be smiling 
 And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand 
 The hour that the ship comes in 
 And the words that are used for to get the ship confused 
 Will not be understood as they're spoken 
 For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night 
 And be buried at the bottom of the ocean 
 A song will lift as the mainsail shifts 
 And the boat drifts onto the shoreline 
 And the sun will respect every face on the deck 
 The hour that the ship comes in 
 And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold 
 For your weary toes to be a-touchin' 
 And the ship's wise men will remind you once again 
 That the whole wide world is watchin' 
 Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes 
 And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming 
 But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real 
 The hour that the ship comes in 
 And they'll raise their hands, saying ""We'll meet all your demands"" 
 But we'll shout from the bow, ""Your days are numbered"" 
 And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drowned in the tide 
 And like Goliath they'll be conquered"
34,Bob Dylan,rock,The Lonesome Death Of Hattie Carroll,"William Zanzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll 
 With a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger 
 At a Baltimore hotel society gatherin' 
 And the cops were called in and his weapon took from him 
 As they rode him in custody down to the station 
 And booked William Zanzinger for first-degree murder 
 Oh, you who philosophize disgrace, and criticize all fears 
 Take the rag away from your face, now ain't the time for your tears 
 William Zanzinger, who at twenty-four years owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres 
 With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him 
 And high office relations in the politics of Maryland 
 Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders 
 And swear words and sneering, and his tongue, it was a-snarling 
 And in a manner of minutes, on bail was out walking 
 But you who philosophize disgrace, and criticize all fears 
 Take the rag away from your face, now ain't the time for your tears 
 Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen 
 She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children 
 Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage 
 And never sat once at the head of the table 
 And didn't even talk to the people at the table 
 Who just cleaned up all the food from the table 
 And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level 
 Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane 
 Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle 
 And she never did nothing to William Zanzinger 
 And you who philosophize disgrace, and criticize all fears 
 Take the rag away from your face, now ain't the time for your tears 
 In the courtroom of honor, the judge pounded his gavel 
 To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level 
 And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded 
 And that even the nobles get properly handled 
 Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em 
 And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom 
 Stared at the person who killed for no reason 
 Who just happened to be feelin' that way without warnin' 
 And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished 
 And handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance, William Zanzinger with a six-months entence 
 Oh, you who philosophize disgrace, and criticize all fears 
 Bury the rag deep in your face, now's the time for your tears"
35,Bob Dylan,rock,Restless Farewell,"Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend 
 Be it mine right or wrongfully 
 I let it slip gladly to my friends 
 To tie up the time most forcefully 
 But the bottles are done, we've killed each one 
 And the table's full and overflowed 
 And the corner sign says it's closing time 
 So I'll bid farewell and be down the road 
 Oh, every girl that ever I've touched 
 I did not do it harmfully 
 And every girl that ever I've hurt 
 I did not do it knowingly 
 But to remain as friends 
 You need the time to make amends and stay behind 
 And since my feet are now fast and point away from the past 
 I'll bid farewell and be down the line 
 Oh, every foe that ever I faced 
 The cause was there before we came 
 And every cause that ever I fought 
 I fought it full without regret or shame 
 But the dark does die 
 As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes must meet the dawn 
 And if I see the day I'd only have to stay 
 So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone 
 Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind 
 I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung 
 But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes 
 It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung 
 But the time ain't tall 
 Yet on time you depend and no word is possessed by no special friend 
 And though the line is cut, it ain't quite the end 
 I'll just bid farewell 'til we meet again 
 Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time 
 To disgrace, distract, and bother me 
 And the dirt of gossip blows into my face 
 And the dust of rumors covers me 
 But if the arrow is straight and the point is slick 
 It can pierce through dust, no matter how thick 
 So I'll make my stand and remain as I am 
 And bid farewell and not give a damn"

37,Bob Dylan,rock,Black Crow Blues,"I woke in the mornin' wandering, weary and worn out 
 I woke in the mornin' wandering, weary and worn out 
 Wishin' my long-lost lover would walk to me and talk to me 
 Tell me what it's all about 
 I was standin' at the side road, listenin' to the billboard knock 
 Standin' at the side road, listenin' to the billboard knock 
 Well, my wrist was empty but my nerves were kickin' 
 Tickin' like a clock 
 If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front 
 If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front 
 You can come to me sometime, nighttime, daytime 
 Anytime you want 
 Sometimes I'm thinkin' I'm too high to fall 
 Sometimes I'm thinkin' I'm much too high to fall 
 Other times I'm thinkin' I'm so low I don't know 
 If I can come up at all 
 Black crows in the meadow, sleepin' across the broad highway 
 Black crows in the meadow across the broad highway 
 Though it's funny, honey, I'm out of touch 
 Don't feel much like a scarecrow today"
38,Bob Dylan,rock,Spanish Harlem Incident,"Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem 
 Cannot hold you to its heat 
 Your temperature is too hot for taming 
 Your flaming feet are burning up the street 
 I am homeless, come and take me 
 To reach of your rattling drums 
 Let me know, babe, all about my fortune 
 Down along my restless palms 
 Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed 
 I have fallen far beneath 
 Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing 
 And your flashing diamond teeth 
 The night is pitch black, come and make my 
 Pale face fit into place, oh, please 
 Let me know, babe, I'm nearly drowning 
 If it's you my lifelines trace 
 I've been wondering all about me 
 Ever since I seen you there 
 On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding 
 I know I'm 'round you but I don't know where 
 You have slayed me, you have made me 
 I got to laugh half-ways off my heels 
 I got to know, babe, will you surround me 
 So I can know if I am really real?"
39,Bob Dylan,rock,Chimes Of Freedom,"Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll 
 We ducked inside a doorway as thunder went crashing 
 As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds 
 Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing 
 Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight 
 Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight 
 And for each and every underdog soldier in the night 
 And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing 
 Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched 
 With faces hidden as the walls were tightening 
 As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin' rain 
 Dissolved into the bells of the lightning 
 Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake 
 Tolling for the luckless, they abandoned and forsaked 
 Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake 
 And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing 
 Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail 
 The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder 
 As the clanging of the church bells blew far into the breeze 
 Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder 
 Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind 
 Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind 
 And the poet and the painter far behind his rightful time 
 And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin' 
 In the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales 
 For the disrobed faceless forms of no position 
 Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts 
 All down in taken-for-granted situations 
 Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute 
 For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute 
 For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit 
 And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing 
 Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared 
 And the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting 
 Electric light still struck like arrows fired but for the ones 
 Condemned to drift or else be kept from driftin' 
 Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless seeking trail 
 For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale 
 And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail 
 And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing 
 Starry-eyed and laughing as I recall when we were caught 
 Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended 
 As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look 
 Spellbound and swallowed 'til the tolling ended 
 Tolling for the aching whose wounds cannot be nursed 
 For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse 
 And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe 
 And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'"
40,Bob Dylan,rock,I Shall Be Free No. 10,"Now I'm just average, common too 
 I'm just like him, the same as you 
 I'm everybody's brother and son 
 I ain't different than anyone 
 Ain't no use to talk to me 
 It's just the same as talking to you 
 I was shadow-boxing earlier in the day 
 I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay 
 I said ""Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come 
 26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine 
 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Cassius Clay, you better run 
 99,100 101,102, your ma won't even recognize you 
 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 
 Gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen 
 Well, I don't know, but I've been told 
 The streets of heaven are lined with gold 
 I ask you how things could get much worse 
 If the Russians happen to get up there first 
 Wowee! 
 Pretty scary! 
 Now I'm liberal, but to a degree 
 I want everybody to be free 
 But if you think that I'll let Barry Goldwater 
 Move in next door and marry my daughter 
 You must think I'm crazy! 
 I wouldn't let him do it for all the farms in Cuba 
 Well, I set my monkey on the log 
 And ordered him to do the Dog 
 He wagged his tail and shook his head 
 And he went and did the Cat instead 
 He's a weird monkey! 
 Very funky! 
 I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on 
 Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun 
 I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist 
 And my wig-hat was falling in my face 
 But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court 
 I gotta woman, she's so mean 
 She sticks my boots in the washing machine 
 Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude 
 Puts bubblegum in my food 
 She's funny 
 Wants my money 
 Calls me honey 
 Now I got a friend who spends his life 
 Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife 
 Dreams of stranglin' me with a scarf 
 When my name comes up he pretends to barf 
 I've got a million friends! 
 Now they asked me to read a poem 
 At the sorority sister's home 
 I got knocked down and my head was swimmin' 
 I wound up with the Dean of Women 
 Yippee! 
 I'm a poet, I know it 
 Hope I don't blow it 
 I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange 
 So I look like a walking mountain range 
 And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse 
 Out to the country club and the golf course 
 Carryin' the New York Times 
 Shoot a few holes, blow their minds 
 Well, you're probably wondering by now 
 Just what this song is all about 
 What's probably got you baffled more 
 Is what this thing here is for 
 It's nothin' 
 It's something I learned over in England"
41,Bob Dylan,rock,To Ramona,"Ramona, come closer, shut softly your watery eyes 
 The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise 
 For the flowers of the city, though breathlike, get deathlike sometimes 
 And there's no use in trying to deal with the dying, though I cannot explain that in lines 
 Your cracked country lips, I still wish to kiss, as to be by the strength of your skin 
 Your magnetic movement still captures the minutes I'm in 
 But it grieves my heart, love, to see you trying to be a part of a world that just don't exist 
 It's all just a dream, babe, a vacuum, a scheme, babe, that sucks you into feelin' like this 
 I can see that your head has been twisted and fed with worthless foam from the mouth 
 I can tell you are torn between staying and returning back to to the south 
 You've been fooled into thinking that the finishing end is at hand 
 Yet there's no one to beat you, no one to defeat you 'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad 
 I've heard you say many times that you're better than no one and no one is better than you 
 If you really believe that, you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose 
 From fixtures and forces and friends, your sorrow does stem 
 That hype you and type you, making you feel that you gotta be just like them 
 I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words would turn into a meaningless ring 
 For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring 
 Everything passes, everything changes, just do what you think you should do 
 And someday, maybe, who knows, baby, I'll come and be crying to you"
42,Bob Dylan,rock,Motorpsycho Nightmare,"I pounded on a farmhouse 
 Lookin' for a place to stay 
 I was mighty, mighty tired 
 I had come a long, long way 
 I said ""Hey hey in there 
 Is there anybody home?"" 
 I was standin' on the steps 
 Feelin' most alone 
 When out comes a farmer 
 He must have thought that I was nuts 
 He immediately looked at me 
 And stuck a gun into my guts 
 I fell down to 
 My bended knees 
 Saying ""I dig farmers 
 Don't shoot me, please"" 
 He cocked his rifle 
 And began to shout 
 ""Are you that travelin' salesman 
 That I have heard about?"" 
 I said ""No, no, no 
 I'm a doctor and it's true 
 I'm a clean-cut kid 
 And I been to college too"" 
 Then in comes his daughter 
 Whose name was Rita 
 She looked like she stepped 
 Out of La Dolce Vita 
 I immediately tried to cool it 
 With her dad 
 And told him what a nice 
 Pretty farm he had 
 He said ""What do doctors know 
 About farms, pray tell?"" 
 I said ""I was born at the bottom 
 Of a wishing well"" 
 Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails 
 I guess he knew I wouldn't lie 
 He said ""I guess you're tired"" 
 He said it kind of sly 
 I said ""Yes, ten thousand miles 
 Today I drove"" 
 He said ""I got a bed for you 
 Underneath the stove 
 Just one condition 
 You can go to sleep right now 
 That you don't touch my daughter 
 And in the morning, milk the cows"" 
 I was sleepin' like a rat 
 When I heard something jerkin' 
 There stood Rita 
 Lookin' just like Tony Perkins 
 She said ""Would you like to take a shower? 
 I'll show you up to the door"" 
 I said ""Oh, no, no 
 I've been through this movie before"" 
 I knew I had to split 
 But I did not know how 
 When she said 
 ""Would you like to take that shower now?"" 
 Well, I couldn't leave 
 Unless the old man chased me out 
 'Cause I'd already promised 
 That I'd milk his cows 
 I had to say something 
 To strike him very weird 
 So I yelled 
 ""I like Fidel Castro and his beard"" 
 Rita looked offended 
 But she got out of the way 
 As he came charging down the stairs 
 Sayin' ""What's that I heard you say?"" 
 I said, ""I like Fidel Castro 
 I think you heard me right"" 
 And I ducked as he swung 
 At me with all his might 
 Rita mumbled something 
 'Bout her mother on the hill 
 As his fist, it hit the icebox 
 He said he's going to kill 
 Me if I don't get out the door 
 In two seconds flat 
 ""You unpatriotic 
 Rotten doctor Commie rat"" 
 Well, he threw a Reader's Digest 
 At my head and I did run 
 I did a somersault 
 As I seen him get his gun 
 And crashed through the window 
 At a hundred miles an hour 
 And landed fully blast 
 In his garden flowers 
 Rita said ""Come back"" 
 And he started to load 
 The sun was comin' up 
 And I was runnin' down the road 
 Well, I don't figure I'll be back 
 There for a spell 
 Even though Rita moved away 
 And got a job at a motel 
 He still waits for me 
 Constant on the sly 
 He wants to turn me in 
 To the F.B.I. 
 Me, I romp and stompings 
 Thankful as I romp 
 Without freedom of speech 
 I might be in the swamp"
43,Bob Dylan,rock,My Back Pages,"Crimson flames tied through my ears 
 Rollin' high and mighty traps 
 Pounced with fire on flaming roads 
 Using ideas as my maps 
 ""We'll meet on edges soon,"" said I 
 Proud 'neath heated brow 
 Ah, but I was so much older then 
 I'm younger than that now 
 Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth 
 ""Rip down all hate,"" I screamed 
 Lies that life is black and white 
 Spoke from my skull, I dreamed 
 Romantic facts of musketeers 
 Foundationed deep somehow 
 Ah, but I was so much older then 
 I'm younger than that now 
 Girls' faces formed the forward path 
 From phony jealousy 
 To memorizing politics 
 Of ancient history 
 Flung down by corpse evangelists 
 Unthought of, though, somehow 
 Ah, but I was so much older then 
 I'm younger than that now 
 A self-ordained professor's tongue 
 Too serious to fool 
 Spouted out that liberty 
 Is just equality in school 
 ""Equality,"" I spoke the word 
 As if a wedding vow 
 Ah, but I was so much older then 
 I'm younger than that now 
 In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand 
 At the mongrel dogs who teach 
 Fearing not I'd become my enemy 
 In the instant that I preach 
 My existence led by confusion boats 
 Mutiny from stern to bow 
 Ah, but I was so much older then 
 I'm younger than that now 
 Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats 
 Too noble to neglect 
 Deceived me into thinking 
 I had something to protect 
 Good and bad, I'd define these terms 
 Quite clear, no doubt, somehow 
 Ah, but I was so much older then 
 I'm younger than that now"
44,Bob Dylan,rock,I Don't Believe You,"I can't understand, she let go of my hand 
 And left me here facing the wall 
 I'd sure like to know why she did go 
 But I can't get close to her at all 
 Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime 
 She said she would never forget 
 But now morning is clear, it's like I ain't here 
 She acts like we never met 
 It's all new to me, like some mystery 
 It could even be like a myth 
 But it's hard to think on that she's the same one 
 That last night I was with 
 From darkness, dreams are deserted 
 Am I still dreamin' yet? 
 I wish she'd unlock her voice once and talk 
 'Stead of acting like we never met 
 If she ain't feelin' well, then why don't she tell 
 'Stead of turnin' her back to my face? 
 Without any doubt she seems too far out 
 For me to return to or chase 
 Though her skirt it swayed as the guitar played 
 Her mouth was watery and wet 
 But now something has changed, for she ain't the same 
 She just acts like we never have met 
 If I didn't have to guess, I'd gladly confess 
 To anything I might have tried 
 If I was with her too long or I've done something wrong 
 I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide 
 Though the night ran swirling and whirling 
 I remember her whispering yet 
 But evidently she don't, evidently she won't 
 She just acts like we never have met 
 I'm leavin' today, I'll be on my way 
 Of this I can't say very much 
 But if you want me to, I can be just like you 
 And pretend that we never have touched 
 And if anybody asks me, ""Is it easy to forget?"" 
 I'll say, ""It's easily done 
 You just pick anyone 
 And pretend that you never have met"""
45,Bob Dylan,rock,Ballad In Plain D,"I once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze 
 With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn 
 I courted her proudly but now she is gone 
 Gone as the season she's taken 
 In a young summer's youth, I stole her away 
 From her mother and sister, though close did they stay 
 Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day 
 With strings of guilt, they tried hard to guide us 
 Of the two sisters, I loved the young 
 With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one 
 The constant scrapegoat, she was easily undone 
 By the jealousy of others around her 
 For her parasite sister, I had no respect 
 Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect 
 Countless visions of the other she'd reflect 
 As a crutch for her scenes and her society 
 Myself, for what I did, I cannot be excused 
 The changes I was going through can't even be used 
 For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose 
 The could-be dream-lover of my lifetime 
 With unseen consciousness, I possessed in my grip 
 A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped 
 Noticing not that I'd already slipped 
 To a sin of love's false security 
 From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace 
 Answers of emptiness voice vacancies 
 Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, ""Please- 
 What's wrong, what's exactly the matter?"" 
 And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen 
 The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream 
 At the peak of the night, the king and the queen 
 Tumbled all down into pieces 
 ""The tragic figure,"" her sister did shout. 
 ""Leave her alone, goddamn you, get out."" 
 And I in my armor, turning about 
 And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness 
 Beneath a bare lightbulb the plaster did pound 
 Her sister and I in a screaming battleground 
 And she in between, the victim of sound 
 Soon shattered as a child to the shadows 
 All is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight 
 I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight 
 My mind it was mangled, I ran into the night 
 Leaving all of love's ashes behind me 
 The wind knocks my window, the room it is wet 
 The words to say I'm sorry, I haven't found yet 
 I think of her often and hope whoever she's met 
 Will be fully aware of how precious she is 
 Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me 
 ""How good, how good does it feel to be free?"" 
 And I answer them most mysteriously 
 ""Are birds free from the chains of the skyway?"""
46,Bob Dylan,rock,"It Ain't Me, Babe","Go away from my window 
 Leave at your own chosen speed 
 I'm not the one you want, babe 
 I'm not the one you need 
 You say you're lookin' for someone 
 Who's never weak, but always strong 
 To protect you and defend you 
 Whether you are right or wrong 
 Someone to open each and every door 
 But it ain't me, babe 
 No, no, no, it ain't me, babe 
 It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe 
 Go lightly from the ledge, babe 
 Go lightly on the ground 
 I'm not the one you want, babe 
 I'll only let you down 
 You say you're lookin' for someone 
 Who'll promise never to part 
 Someone to close his eyes to you 
 Someone to close his heart 
 Someone who will die for you and more 
 But it ain't me, babe 
 No, no, no, it ain't me, babe 
 It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe 
 Go melt back in the night 
 Everything inside is made of stone 
 There's nothing in here moving 
 And anyway, I'm not alone 
 You say you're lookin' for someone 
 Who'll pick you up each time you fall 
 To gather flowers constantly 
 And to come each time you call 
 A lover for your life and nothing more 
 But it ain't me, babe 
 No, no, no, it ain't me, babe 
 It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe 
 But it ain't me, babe 
 No, no, no, it ain't me, babe 
 It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe"

 Mixing up the medicine

 Badge out, laid off 
 Says he's got a bad cough 
 Wants to get it paid off 
 Look out kid 
 It's somethin' you did 
 God knows when 
 But you're doin' it again 
 You better duck down the alley way 
 Lookin' for a new friend 
 The man in the coon-skin cap 
 In the big pen 
 Wants eleven dollar bills 
 You only got ten

 Face full of black soot

 Plants in the bed but

 Orders from the D. A. 
 Look out kid 
 Don't matter what you did 
 Walk on your tip toes 
 Don't try No Doz 
 Better stay away from those 
 That carry around a fire hose 
 Keep a clean nose 
 Watch the plain clothes 
 You don't need a weather man 
 To know which way the wind blows

 Hang around a ink well 
 Ring bell, hard to tell 
 If anything is gonna sell 
 Try hard, get barred 
 Get back, write braille 
 Get jailed, jump bail

 Look out kid 
 You're gonna get hit 
 But losers 
 Cheaters 
 Six-time users 
 Hang around the theaters 
 Girl by the whirlpool 
 Lookin' for a new fool 
 Don't follow leaders 
 Watch the parkin' meters 
 Ah, get born, keep warm 
 Short pants, romance, learn to dance 
 Get dressed, get blessed 
 Try to be a success 
 Please her, please him, buy gifts 
 Don't steal, don't lift 
 Twenty years of schoolin' 
 And they put you on the day shift 
 Look out kid 
 They keep it all hid 
 Better jump down a manhole 
 Light yourself a candle 
 Don't wear sandals 
 Try to avoid the scandals 
 Don't wanna be a bum 
 You better chew gum 
 The pump don't work 
 'Cause the vandals took the handles"

 You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees 
 You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees 
 But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole, down upon your knees 
 She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall 
 She never stumbles, she got no place to fall 
 She's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all 
 She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks 
 She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks 
 She's a hypnotist collector, you are a walking antique

50,Bob Dylan,rock,Love Minus Zero/No Limit,"My love, she speaks like silence 
 Without ideals or violence 
 She doesn't have to say she's faithful 
 Yet she's true like ice, like fire 
 People carry roses 
 And make promises by the hours 
 My love, she laughs like the flowers 
 Valentines can't buy her 
 In the dime stores and bus stations 
 People talk of situations 
 Read books, repeat quotations 
 Draw conclusions on the wall 
 Some speak of the future 
 My love, she speaks softly 
 She knows there's no success like failure 
 And that failure's no success at all 
 The cloak and dagger dangles 
 Madams light the candles 
 In ceremonies of the horsemen 
 Even the pawn must hold a grudge 
 Statues made of matchsticks 
 Crumble into one another 
 My love winks, she does not bother 
 She knows too much to argue or to judge 
 The bridge at midnight trembles 
 The country doctor rambles 
 Banker's nieces seek perfection 
 Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring 
 The wind howls like a hammer 
 And the night blows rainy 
 My love, she's like some raven 
 At my window with a broken wing"

 Honey, do you have to ask? 
 Well, I go to pet your monkey 
 I get a face full of claws 
 I ask that who's in the fireplace 
 And you tell me Santa Claus 
 The milkman comes in 
 He's wearing a derby hat 
 And you ask why I don't live here 
 Honey, how come you have to ask me that? 
 Well, I ask for something to eat 
 I'm hungry as a hog 
 So I get brown rice, seaweed 
 And a dirty hot dog 
 I got a hole 
 Where my stomach disappeared 
 Then you ask why I don't live here 
 Honey, I gotta think you're really weird 
 Your grandpa's cane 
 It turns into a sword 
 Your grandma prays to pictures 
 That are pasted on a board 
 Everything inside my pockets 
 Your uncle steals 
 And you ask why I don't live here 
 Honey, I can't believe that you're for real 
 Well, there's fist fights in the kitchen 
 They're enough to make me cry 
 Then the mailman comes in 
 Even he's gotta take a side 
 Even the butler 
 He's got something to prove 
 Then you ask why I don't live here 
 Honey, how come you don't move?"
53,Bob Dylan,rock,Bob Dylan's 115th Dream,"I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land 
 I yelled for Captain Arab I have you understand 
 Who came running to the deck, said, ""Boys, forget the whale 
 We're going over yonder, cut the engines, change the sail 
 Haul on the bowline,"" we sang that melody 
 Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea 
 ""I think I'll call it America,"" I said as we hit land 
 I took a deep breath, I fell down, I could not stand 
 Captain Arab, he started writing up some deeds 
 He said, ""Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads"" 
 Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon 
 He throws us all in jail for carryin' harpoons 
 Ah, me, I busted out, don't even ask me how 
 I went to get some help, I walked by a Guernsey cow 
 Who directed me down to the Bowery slums 
 Where people carried signs around, saying, ""Ban the bums"" 
 I jumped right into line saying, ""I hope that I'm not late"" 
 When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight 
 I went into a restaurant, lookin' for the cook 
 I told them I was the editor of a famous etiquette book 
 The waitress he was handsome, he wore a powder blue cape 
 I ordered some suzette, I said, ""Could you please make that crepe?"" 
 Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boilin' fat 
 Food was flying everywhere, I left without my hat 
 Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank 
 To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank 
 They asked me for some collateral, and I pulled down my pants 
 They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France 
 Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend 
 Who knocked me out and robbed my boots and I was on the street again 
 Well, I rapped upon a house with the U.S. flag upon display 
 I said, ""Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way"" 
 The man says, ""Get out of here, I'll tear you limb from limb"" 
 I said, ""You know they refused Jesus, too.""  He said, ""You're not Him 
 Get out of here before I break your bones, I ain't your pop"" 
 I decided to have him arrested and I went looking for a cop 
 I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab 
 I went out the other door, this Englishman said, ""Fab"" 
 As he saw me leap a hot dog stand and a chariot that stood 
 Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood 
 I ran right through the front door like a hobo sailor does 
 But it was just a funeral parlor, and the man asked me who I was 
 I repeated that my friends were all in jail, with a sigh 
 He gave me his card, he said, ""Call me if they die"" 
 I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street 
 When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet 
 A pay phone was ringing and it just about blew my mind 
 When I picked it up and said hello, this foot came through the line 
 Well, by this time I was fed up at tryin' to make a stab 
 At bringin' back any help for my friends and Captain Arab 
 I decided to flip a coin like either heads or tails 
 Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail 
 So I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip 
 It came up tails, it rhymed with sails, so I made it back to the ship 
 Well, I got back and took the parkin' ticket off the mast 
 I was ripping it to shreds when this Coast Guard boat went past 
 They asked me my name and I said, ""Captain Kidd"" 
 They believed me but they wanted to know what exactly that I did 
 I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed 
 They let me go right away, they were very paranoid 
 Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale 
 That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail 
 But the funniest thing was when I was leavin' the bay 
 I saw three ships a-sailin', they were all heading my way 
 I asked the captain what his name was and how come he didn't drive a truck 
 He said his name was Columbus. I just said, ""Good luck"""
54,Bob Dylan,rock,Mr. Tambourine Man,"Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me 
 I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to 
 Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me 
 In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come followin' you 
 Though I know that evening's empire 
 Has returned into sand 
 Vanished from my hand 
 Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping 
 My weariness amazes me 
 I am branded on my feet 
 I have no one to meet 
 And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming 
 Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me 
 I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to 
 Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me 
 In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come followin' you 
 Take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship 
 My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip 
 My toes too numb to step 
 Wait only for my boot heels to be wandering 
 I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade 
 Into my own parade 
 Cast your dancing spell my way 
 I promise to go under it 
 Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me 
 I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to 
 Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me 
 In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come followin' you 
 Though you might hear laughing spinning, swinging madly across the sun 
 It's not aimed at anyone 
 It's just escaping on the run 
 And, but for the sky, there are no fences facing 
 And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme 
 To your tambourine in time 
 It's just a ragged clown behind 
 I wouldn't pay it any mind 
 It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing 
 Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me 
 I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to 
 Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me 
 In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come followin' you 
 Then take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind 
 Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves 
 The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach 
 Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow 
 Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free 
 Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands 
 With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves 
 Let me forget about today until tomorrow 
 Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me 
 I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to 
 Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me 
 In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come followin' you"
55,Bob Dylan,rock,Gates Of Eden,"Of war and peace the truth just twists, its curfew gull it glides 
 Upon four-legged forest clouds, the cowboy angel rides 
 With his candle lit into the sun, though its glow is waxed in black 
 All except when 'neath the trees of Eden 
 The lamppost stands with folded arms, its iron claws attached 
 To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail, though it shadows metal badge 
 All and all can only fall with a crashing but meaningless blow 
 No sound ever comes from the gates of Eden 
 The savage soldier just sticks his head in sand and then complains 
 Unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf, but still remains 
 Upon the beach where hound dogs bay at ships with tattooed sails 
 Heading for the gates of Eden 
 With a time-rusted compass blade, Aladdin and his lamp 
 Sits with Utopian hermit monks, sidesaddle on the Golden Calf 
 And on their promises of paradise, you will not hear a laugh 
 All except inside the gates of Eden 
 Relationships of ownership, they whisper in the wings 
 To those condemned to act accordingly and wait for succeeding kings 
 And I try to harmonize with songs the lonesome sparrow sings 
 There are no kings inside the gates of Eden 
 The motorcycle black Madonna, two-wheeled gypsy queen 
 And her silver-studded phantom cause the gray flannel dwarf to scream 
 As he weeps to wicked birds of prey who pick upon his bread crumb sins 
 And there are no sins inside the gates of Eden 
 The kingdoms of experience, in the precious winds they rot 
 While paupers change possessions, each one wishing for what the other has got 
 And the princess and the prince discuss what's real and what is not 
 It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden 
 The foreign sun, it squints upon a bed that is never mine 
 As friends and other strangers from their fates try to resign 
 Leaving men wholly, totally free to do anything they wish to do but die 
 And there are no trials inside the gates of Eden 
 At dawn my lover comes to me and tells me of her dreams 
 With no attempts to shovel the glimpse into the ditch of what each one means 
 At times I think there are no words but these to tell what's true 
 And there are no truths outside the gates of Eden"
56,Bob Dylan,rock,"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)","Darkness at the break of noon 
 Shadows even the silver spoon 
 The handmade blade, the child's balloon 
 Eclipses both the sun and moon 
 To understand you know too soon there is no sense in trying 
 Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn 
 Suicide remarks are torn 
 From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn 
 Plays wasted words, proves to warn 
 That he not busy being born is busy dying 
 Temptation's page flies out the door 
 You follow, find yourself at war 
 Watch waterfalls of pity roar 
 You feel to moan but unlike before 
 You discover that you'd just be one more person crying 
 So don't fear if you hear 
 A foreign sound to your ear 
 It's alright, Ma 
 I'm only sighing 
 As some warn victory, some downfall 
 Private reasons great or small 
 Can be seen in the eyes of those that call 
 To make all that should be killed to crawl 
 While others say don't hate nothing at all, except hatred 
 Disillusioned words like bullets bark 
 As human gods aim for their mark 
 Make everything from toy guns that spark 
 To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark 
 It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred 
 While preachers preach of evil fates 
 Teachers teach that knowledge waits 
 Can lead to hundred dollar plates 
 Goodness hides behind its gates 
 But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked 
 And though the rules of the road have been lodged 
 It's only people's games that you got to dodge 
 And it's alright, Ma 
 I can make it 
 Advertising signs that con 
 You into thinking you're the one 
 That can do what's never been done 
 That can win what's never been won 
 Meantime, life outside goes on all around you 
 You lose yourself, you reappear 
 You suddenly find you got nothing to fear 
 Alone you stand with nobody near 
 When a trembling distant voice unclear 
 Startles your sleeping ears to hear that somebody thinks they really found you 
 A question in your nerves is lit 
 Yet you know there is no answer fit 
 To satisfy, insure you not to quit 
 To keep it in your mind and not forget 
 That it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to 
 But though the masters make the rules 
 For the wise men and the fools 
 I got nothing, Ma 
 To live up to 
 For them that must obey authority 
 That they do not respect in any degree 
 Who despise their jobs, their destinies 
 Speak jealously of them that are free 
 Cultivate their flowers to be 
 Nothing more than something they invest in 
 While some on principles baptized 
 To strict party platform ties 
 Social clubs in drag disguise 
 Outsiders they can freely criticize 
 Tell nothing except who to idolize 
 And then say God bless him 
 While one who sings with his tongue on fire 
 Gargles in the rat race choir 
 Bent out of shape from society’s pliers 
 Cares not to come up any higher 
 But rather get you down in the hole 
 That he’s in 
 But I mean no harm nor put fault 
 On anyone that lives in a vault 
 But it’s alright, Ma, if I can’t please him 
 Old lady judges watch people in pairs 
 Limited in sex, they dare 
 To push fake morals, insult and stare 
 While money doesn't talk, it swears 
 Obscenity, who really cares, propaganda, all is phony 
 While them that defend what they cannot see 
 With a killer's pride, security 
 It blows their minds most bitterly 
 For them that think death's honesty 
 Won't fall upon them naturally, life sometimes must get lonely 
 My eyes collide head-on with stuffed 
 Graveyards, false goals, I scuff 
 At pettiness which plays so rough 
 Walk upside-down inside handcuffs 
 Kick my legs to crash it off 
 Say, ""Okay, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"" 
 And if my thought-dreams could be seen 
 They'd probably put my head in a guillotine 
 But it's alright, Ma 
 It's life, and life only"
57,Bob Dylan,rock,"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue","You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last 
 But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast 
 Yonder stands your orphan with his gun 
 Crying like a fire in the sun 
 Look out, the saints are comin' through 
 And it's all over now, Baby Blue 
 The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense 
 Take what you have gathered from coincidence 
 The empty-handed painter from your streets 
 Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets 
 The sky too is folding under you 
 And it's all over now, Baby Blue 
 All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home 
 Your empty-handed army is all going home 
 Your lover who just walked out the door 
 Has taken all his blankets from the floor 
 The carpet too is moving under you 
 And it's all over now, Baby Blue 
 Leave your stepping stones behind there, something calls for you 
 Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you 
 The vagabond who's rapping at your door 
 Is standing in the clothes that you once wore 
 Strike another match, go start anew 
 And it's all over now, Baby Blue"
58,Bob Dylan,rock,Like A Rolling Stone,"Once upon a time you dressed so fine 
 You threw the bums a dime in your prime 
 Didn't you? 
 People'd call, say: ""Beware, doll, you're bound to fall"" 
 You thought they were all 
 Kiddin' you 
 You used to laugh about 
 Everybody that was hanging out 
 Now you don't talk so loud 
 Now you don't seem so proud 
 About having to be scrounging 
 For your next meal 
 How does it feel? 
 How does it feel 
 To be without a home 
 Like a complete unknown 
 Like a rolling stone? 
 Oh, you've gone to the finest school, alright, miss lonely 
 But you know you only used to get 
 Juiced in it 
 Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street 
 And now you're gonna have to get 
 Used to it 
 You say you'd never compromise 
 With the mystery tramp, but now you realize 
 He's not selling any alibis 
 As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes 
 And say: ""Do you want to 
 Make a deal?"" 
 How does it feel? 
 How does it feel 
 To be on your own 
 With no direction home 
 A complete unknown 
 Like a rolling stone? 
 Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns 
 On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did 
 Tricks for you 
 You never understood that it ain't no good 
 You shouldn't let other people get your 
 Kicks for you 
 You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat 
 Who carried on his shoulder a siamese cat 
 Ain't it hard when you discover that 
 He really wasn't where it's at 
 After he took from you everything 
 He could steal? 
 How does it feel? 
 How does it feel 
 To hang on your home 
 With no direction home 
 Like a complete unknown 
 Like a rolling stone? 
 Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people 
 They're all drinking thinking that they 
 Got it made 
 Exchanging all their precious gifts 
 But you'd better take your diamond ring 
 You'd better pawn it, baby 
 You used to be so amused 
 At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used 
 Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse 
 When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose 
 You're invisible now, you got no secrets 
 To conceal 
 How does it feel? 
 How does it feel 
 To be on your own 
 With no direction home 
 Like a complete unknown 
 Like a rolling stone?"
59,Bob Dylan,rock,Tombstone Blues,"The sweet pretty things are in bed now, of course 
 The city fathers, they're trying to endorse 
 The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse 
 But the town has no need to be nervous 
 The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits 
 To Jezebel the nun, she violently knits 
 A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits 
 At the head of the Chamber of Commerce 
 Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes 
 Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food 
 I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues 
 The hysterical bride in the penny arcade 
 Screaming, she moans, ""I've just been made"" 
 Then sends for the doctor who pulls down the shade 
 And says, ""My advice is to not let the boys in"" 
 Now the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside 
 He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride 
 ""Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride 
 You will not die, it's not poison"" 
 Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes 
 Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food 
 I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues 
 Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief 
 Looks up at his hero the Commander-in-Chief 
 Saying, ""Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief 
 Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"" 
 The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly 
 Saying, ""Death to all those who would whimper and cry"" 
 And dropping a barbell, he points to the sky 
 Saying, ""The sun's not yellow, it's chicken"" 
 Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes 
 Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food 
 I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues 
 The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save 
 Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves 
 Puts the pied pipers in prison and fattens the slaves 
 Then sends them out to the jungle 
 Gypsy Davey with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps 
 With his faithful slave Pedro, behind him he tramps 
 With a fantastic collection of stamps 
 To win friends and influence his uncle 
 Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes 
 Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food 
 I'm in trouble with the tombstone blues 
 The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone 
 Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown 
 At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone 
 But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter 
 I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill 
 I would set him in chains at the top of the hill 
 Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille 
 He could die happily ever after 
 Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes 
 Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food 
 I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues 
 Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped a bed roll 
 Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole 
 And the National Bank, at a profit, sells road maps for the soul 
 To the old folks home and the college 
 I wish I could write you a melody so plain 
 That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane 
 That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain 
 Of your useless and pointless knowledge 
 Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes 
 Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food 
 I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues"
60,Bob Dylan,rock,"It Takes A Lot To Laugh, It Takes A Train To Cry","Well, I ride on the mail train, babe, can't buy a thrill 
 Well, I've been up all night leanin' on the windowsill 
 Well, if I die on top of the hill 
 And if I don't make it, you know my baby will 
 Don't the moon look good, mama, shinin' through the trees? 
 Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E's? 
 Don't the sun look good goin' down over the sea? 
 But don't my gal look fine when she's comin' after me? 
 Now the wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost 
 I went to tell everybody, but I could not get across 
 Well, I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your boss 
 Don't say I never warned you when your train gets lost"
61,Bob Dylan,rock,From A Buick 6,"I got this graveyard woman, you know she keeps my kids 
 But my soulful mama, you know she keeps me hid 
 She's a junkyard angel and she always gives me bread 
 Well, if I go down dyin', you know she's bound to put a blanket on my bed 
 Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge 
 I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge 
 Here she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with a thread 
 Well, if I go down dyin', you know she's bound to put a blanket on my bed 
 Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much 
 She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch 
 She keeps this four-ten all loaded with lead 
 Well, if I go down dyin', you know she's bound to put a blanket on my bed 
 Well, you know I need a steam shovel, mama, to keep away the dead 
 I need a dump truck, baby, to unload my head 
 She brings me everything and more, and just like I said 
 Well, if I go down dyin', you know she's bound to put a blanket on my bed"
62,Bob Dylan,rock,Ballad Of A Thin Man,"You walk into the room 
 With your pencil in your hand 
 You see somebody naked 
 And you say, ""Who is that man?"" 
 You try so hard 
 But you don't understand 
 Just what you'll say 
 When you get home 
 Because something is happening here 
 But you don't know what it is 
 Do you, Mister Jones? 
 You raise up your head 
 And you ask, ""Is this where it is?"" 
 And somebody points to you and says 
 ""It's his""

 And somebody else says, ""Where what is?"" 
 And you say, ""Oh my God

 To be such a freak?"" 
 And you say, ""Impossible"" 
 As he hands you a bone 
 And something is happening here 
 But you don't know what it is 
 Do you, Mister Jones? 
 You have many contacts 
 Among the lumberjacks 
 To get you facts 
 When someone attacks your imagination 
 But nobody has any respect 
 Anyway they already expect you 
 To all give a check 
 To tax-deductible charity organizations 
 You've been with the professors 
 And they've all liked your looks 
 With great lawyers you have 
 Discussed lepers and crooks 
 You've been through all of 
 F. Scott Fitzgerald's books

 It's well known 
 But something is happening here 
 And you don't know what it is 
 Do you, Mister Jones? 
 Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you 
 And then he kneels 
 He crosses himself 
 And then he clicks his high heels 
 And without further notice 
 He asks you how it feels 
 And he says, ""Here is your throat back 
 Thanks for the loan"" 
 And you know something is happening 
 But you don't know what it is 
 Do you, Mister Jones? 
 Now you see this one-eyed midget 
 Shouting the word ""Now"" 
 And you say, ""For what reason?"" 
 And he says, ""How?"" 
 And you say, ""What does this mean?"" 
 And he screams back, ""You're a cow 
 Give me some milk 
 Or else go home"" 
 And you know something is happening 
 But you don't know what it is 
 Do you, Mister Jones? 
 Well, you walk into the room 
 Like a camel and then you frown 
 You put your eyes in your pocket 
 And your nose on the ground 
 There ought to be a law 
 Against you comin' around 
 You should be made 
 To wear earphones 
 'Cause something is happening 
 And you don't know what it is

 Now when all the clowns that you have commissioned 
 Have died in battle or in vain 
 And you're sick of all this repetition 
 Won't you come see me, Queen Jane? 
 Won't you come see me, Queen Jane? 
 Oh when all of your advisers heave their plastic 
 At your feet to convince you of your pain 
 Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic 
 Won't you come see me, Queen Jane? 
 Won't you come see me, Queen Jane? 
 Now when all of the bandits that you turn your other cheek to

 Now if you see Saint Annie, please tell her, ""Thanks a lot"" 
 I cannot move, my fingers are all in a knot 
 I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot 
 And my best friend, my doctor won't even say what it is I've got 
 Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the goddess of gloom 
 She speaks good English, and she invites you up into her room 
 And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon 
 And she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon 
 Up on Housing Project Hill, it's either fortune or fame 
 You must pick one or the other, though neither of them are to be what they claim 
 If you're lookin' to get silly, you better go back to from where you came 
 Because the cops don't need you and, man, they expect the same 
 Now all the authorities, they just stand around and boast 
 How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post 
 And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast 
 Who looked so fine at first but left looking just like a ghost 
 I started out on burgundy but soon hit the harder stuff 
 Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough

 They're painting the passports brown

 The circus is in town 
 Here comes the blind commissioner

 One hand is tied to the tightrope walker 
 The other is in his pants 
 And the riot squad, they're restless 
 They need somewhere to go 
 As Lady and I look out tonight 
 From Desolation Row 
 Cinderella, she seems so easy 
 ""It takes one to know one,"" she smiles 
 And puts her hands in her back pocket 
 Bette Davis style 
 And in comes Romeo, he's moaning 
 ""You belong to me, I believe"" 
 And someone says, ""You're in the wrong place, my friend 
 You'd better leave"" 
 And the only sound that's left 
 After the ambulances go 
 Is Cinderella sweeping up 
 On Desolation Row 
 Now the moon is almost hidden 
 The stars are beginning to hide 
 The fortune telling lady 
 Has even taken all her things inside 
 All except for Cain and Abel 
 And the hunchback of Notre Dame 
 Everybody's making love 
 Or else expecting rain 
 And the good Samaritan, he's dressing 
 He's getting ready for the show 
 He's going to the carnival 
 Tonight on Desolation Row 
 Ophelia, she's 'neath the window 
 For her I feel so afraid 
 On her 22nd birthday 
 She already is an old maid 
 To her death is quite romantic 
 She wears an ironed vest 
 Her profession's her religion 
 Her sin is her lifelessness 
 And though her eyes are fixed upon 
 Noah's great rainbow 
 She spends her time peeking into 
 Desolation Row 
 Einstein disguised as Robin Hood 
 With his memories in a trunk 
 Passed this way an hour ago 
 With his friend, a jealous monk 
 Now he looked so immaculately frightful 
 As he bummed a cigarette 
 Then he went off sniffing drainpipes 
 And reciting the alphabet 
 You would not think to look at him 
 But he was famous long ago 
 For playing the electric violin 
 On Desolation Row 
 Dr. Filth, he keeps his world 
 Inside of a leather cup 
 But all his sexless patients 
 They are trying to blow it up 
 Now his nurse, some local loser 
 She's in charge of the cyanide hole 
 And she also keeps the cards that read 
 ""Have mercy on his soul"" 
 They all play on the penny whistle 
 You can hear them blow 
 If you lean your head out far enough 
 From Desolation Row 
 Across the street they've nailed the curtains 
 They're getting ready for the feast 
 The phantom of the opera 
 In a perfect image of a priest 
 They are spoon-feeding Casanova 
 To get him to feel more assured 
 Then they'll kill him with self-confidence 
 After poisoning him with words 
 And the phantom shouting to skinny girls 
 ""Get out of here if you don't know"" 
 Casanova is just being punished 
 For going to Desolation Row 
 At midnight all the agents 
 And the superhuman crew 
 Come out and round up everyone 
 That knows more than they do 
 And they bring them to the factory 
 Where their heart attack machine 
 Is strapped across their shoulders 
 And then the kerosene 
 Is brought down from the castles 
 By insurance men who go 
 Check to see that nobody is escaping 
 To Desolation Row 
 Praise be to Nero's Neptune 
 The Titanic sails at dawn 
 Everybody's shouting 
 ""Which side are you on?"" 
 And Ezra Pound and T.S. Elliot 
 Fighting in the captain's tower 
 While calypso singers laugh at them 
 And fishermen hold flowers 
 Between the windows of the sea 
 Where lovely mermaids flow 
 And nobody has to think too much 
 About Desolation Row 
 Yes, I received your letter yesterday 
 About the time the doorknob broke 
 When you asked me how I was doing 
 Was that some kind of joke? 
 All these people that you mentioned 
 Yes, I know them, they are quite lame 
 I had to rearrange their faces 
 And give them all another name 
 Right now I can't read too good 
 Don't send me no more letters, no 
 Not unless you mail them from 
 Desolation Row"
67,Bob Dylan,rock,Rainy Day Women #12 & 35,"Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good 
 They'll stone you just like they said they would 
 They'll stone you when you're tryin' to go home 
 Then they'll stone you when you're there all alone 
 But I would not feel so all alone 
 Everybody must get stoned 
 Well, they'll stone you when you're walkin' on the street 
 They'll stone you when you're tryin' to keep your seat 
 They'll stone you when you're walkin' on the floor 
 They'll stone you when you're walkin' to the door 
 But I would not feel so all alone 
 Everybody must get stoned 
 They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table 
 They'll stone you when you are young and able 
 They'll stone you when you're tryin' to make a buck 
 They'll stone you and then they'll say good luck 
 Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone 
 Everybody must get stoned 
 Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end 
 Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again 
 They'll stone you when you're riding in your car 
 They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar 
 Yes, but I would not feel so all alone 
 Everybody must get stoned, alright 
 Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone 
 They'll stone you when you are walking home 
 They'll stone you and then say you are brave 
 They'll stone you when you're sent down in your grave 
 But I would not feel so all alone 
 Everybody must get stoned"
68,Bob Dylan,rock,Pledging My Time,"Well, early in the morning to late at night 
 I got a poison headache, but I feel alright 
 I'm pledging my time to you 
 Hopin' you'll come through too 
 Well, the hobo got too high and he came to me naturally 
 He stole my baby, then he wanted to steal me 
 I'm pledging my time to you 
 Hopin' you'll come through too 
 Won't you come with me, baby, I'll take you where you wanna go 
 And if it don't work out, you'll be the first to know 
 I'm pledging my time to you 
 Hopin' you'll come through too 
 Well, the room is so stuffy I can hardly breathe 
 Everybody's gone but me and you, and I can't be the last to leave 
 I'm pledging my time to you 
 Hopin' you'll come through too 
 Well, they sent for the ambulance, then one was sent 
 Somebody got lucky, but it was an accident 
 I'm pledging my time to you 
 Hopin' you'll come through too"
69,Bob Dylan,rock,Visions Of Johanna,"Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're tryin' to be so quiet? 
 We'll sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it 
 And Louise holds a handful of rain 
 Tempting you to defy it 
 Lights flicker from the opposite loft 
 In this room the heat pipes just cough 
 The country music station plays soft 
 But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off 
 Just Louise 
 And her lover, so entwined 
 And these visions of Johanna 
 That conquer my mind 
 In the empty lot where the ladies play blind man's bluff with the key chain 
 And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D Train 
 We can hear the nightwatchman click his flashlight 
 Ask himself if it's him or them that's insane 
 Louise, she's alright, she's just near 
 She's delicate and seems like the mirror 
 But she makes it all to concise and clear 
 That Johanna's not here 
 The ghost of electricity 
 Howls in the bones of her face 
 Where these visions of Johanna 
 Have now taken my place 
 Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously 
 He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously 
 And when bringing her name up 
 He speaks of a farewell kiss to me 
 He's sure got a lot of gall 
 To be so useless and all 
 Muttering small talk at the wall 
 While I'm in the hall 
 Oh, how can I explain? 
 It's so hard to get on 
 And these visions of Johanna 
 They've kept me up past the dawn 
 Inside the museums, infinity goes up on trial 
 Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while 
 But Mona Lisa must have had the highway blues 
 You can tell by the way she smiles 
 See the primitive wallflower freeze 
 When the jelly-faced women all sneeze 
 Hear the one with the mustache say ""Jeez, 
 I can't find my knees"" 
 Both jewels and binoculars 
 Hang from the head of the mule 
 But these visions of Johanna 
 They make it all seem so cruel 
 The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him 
 Saying, ""Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him"" 
 But like Louise always says 
 ""You can't look at much, can you man?"" as she herself prepares for him 
 My Madonna, she still has not showed 
 We see this empty cage now corrode 
 Where her cape of the stage once had flowed 
 The fiddler, he now steps to the road 
 He writes ""Everything's been returned which was owed"" 
 On the back of the fish truck that loads 
 While my conscience explodes 
 The harmonicas play 
 The skeleton keys and the rain 
 And these visions of Johanna 
 Are now all that remain"
70,Bob Dylan,rock,One Of Us Must Know (Sooner Or Later),"I didn't mean to treat you so bad 
 You shouldn't take it so personal 
 I didn't mean to make you so sad 
 You just happened to be there, that's all 
 When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile 
 I thought that it was well understood 
 That you'd be comin' back in a little while 
 I didn't know that you were sayin' goodbye for good 
 But sooner or later, one of us must know 
 That you just did what you're supposed to do 
 Sooner or later, one of us must know 
 That I really did try to get close to you 
 I couldn't see what you could show me 
 Your scarf had kept your mouth well-hid 
 I couldn't see how you could know me 
 But you said you knew me and I believed you did 
 When you whispered in my ear 
 And asked me if I was leavin' with you or her 
 I didn't realize just what I did hear 
 I didn't realize how young you were 
 But sooner or later, one of us must know 
 That you just did what you're supposed to do 
 Sooner or later, one of us must know 
 That I really did try to get close to you 
 I couldn't see when it started snowin' 
 Your voice was all that I heard 
 I couldn't see where we were goin' 
 But you said you knew and I took your word 
 And then you told me later as I apologized 
 That you were just kiddin' me, you weren't really from the farm 
 And I told you as you clawed out my eyes 
 That I never really meant to do you any harm 
 But sooner or later, one of us must know 
 That you just did what you're supposed to do 
 Sooner or later, one of us must know 
 That I really did try to get close to you"
71,Bob Dylan,rock,I Want You,"The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ grinder cries 
 The silver saxophones say I should refuse you 
 The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn 
 But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you 
 I want you 
 I want you 
 I want you so bad 
 Honey, I want you 
 The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep 
 And the saviors who are fast asleep, they wait for you 
 And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup 
 And ask me to open up the gate for you 
 I want you 
 I want you 
 Yes, I want you so bad 
 Honey, I want you 
 Now all my fathers, they've gone down 
 True love, they've been without it 
 And all their daughters put me down 
 'Cause I don't think about it 
 Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid 
 She knows that I'm not afraid to look at her 
 She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see 
 She knows where I'd like to be, but it doesn't matter 
 I want you 
 I want you 
 Yes, I want you so bad 
 Honey, I want you 
 Now your dancing child with his Chinese suit, he spoke to me, I took his flute 
 No, I wasn't that cute to him, was I? 
 But I did it because he lied and because he took you for a ride 
 And because time was on his side and because I 
 Want you 
 I want you 
 Yes, I want you so bad 
 Honey, I want you"
72,Bob Dylan,rock,Stuck Inside Of Mobile With The Memphis Blues Again,"Ah, the rag man draws circles up and down the block 
 I'd ask him what the matter was, but I know that he don't talk 
 And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape 
 But deep inside my heart, I know I can't escape 
 Oh, mama 
 Can this really be the end? 
 To be stuck inside of Mobile 
 With the Memphis blues again? 
 Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells 
 Speaking to some French girl who says she knows me well 
 And I would send a message to find out if she's talked 
 But the post office has been stolen and the mailbox is locked 
 Oh, mama 
 Can this really be the end? 
 To be stuck inside of Mobile 
 With the Memphis blues again? 
 Mona tried to tell me to stay away from the train line 
 She said that all the railroad men just drink up your blood like wine 
 And I said, ""Oh, I didn't know that, but then again, there's only one I've met 
 And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette"" 
 Oh, mama 
 Can this really be the end? 
 To be stuck inside of Mobile 
 With the Memphis blues again? 
 Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks 
 But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked 
 But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control 
 When he built a fire on Main Street and shot it full of holes 
 Oh, mama 
 Can this really be the end? 
 To be stuck inside of Mobile 
 With the Memphis blues again? 
 Now the senator came down here, showing everyone his gun 
 Handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son 
 And me, I nearly got busted, and wouldn't it be my luck 
 To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck? 
 Oh, mama 
 Is this really the end? 
 To be stuck inside of Mobile 
 With the Memphis blues again? 
 Now the teen preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed 
 With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest 
 But he cursed me when I proved to him, then I whispered, said ""Not even you can hide 
 You see, you're just like me, I hope you're satisfied"" 
 Oh, mama 
 Can this really be the end? 
 To be stuck inside of Mobile 
 With the Memphis blues again? 
 Now the rain man gave me two cures, then he said, ""Jump right in"" 
 The one was Texas medicine, the other was just railroad gin 
 And like a fool, I mixed them, and it strangled up my mind 
 And now people just get uglier, and I have no sense of time 
 Oh, mama 
 Can this really be the end? 
 To be stuck inside of Mobile 
 With the Memphis blues again? 
 When Ruthie says come see her in honky-tonk lagoon 
 Where I can watch her waltz for free 'neath her Panamanian moon 
 And I say, ""Ah, come on now, you know about my debutante"" 
 And she says, ""Your debutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want"" 
 Oh, mama 
 Can this really be the end? 
 To be stuck inside of Mobile 
 With the Memphis blues again? 
 Now the bricks lay on Grand Street where the neon madmen climb 
 They all fall there so perfectly, it all seems so well-timed 
 And here I sit so patiently, waiting to find out what price 
 You have to pay to get out of going through all these things twice 
 Oh, mama 
 Is this really the end? 
 To be stuck here inside of Mobile 
 With the Memphis blues again?"
73,Bob Dylan,rock,Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat,"Well, I see you got your brand new, leopard-skin pill-box hat 
 Yes, I see you got your brand new, leopard-skin pill-box hat 
 Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under somethin' like that 
 Under your brand new, leopard-skin pill-box hat 
 Well, you look so pretty in it, honey, can I jump on it sometime? 
 Yes, I just wanna see if it's really the expensive kind 
 You know it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine 
 Your brand new, leopard-skin pill-box hat 
 Well, if you wanna see the sun rise, honey, I know where 
 We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare 
 Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sittin' there 
 In your brand new, leopard-skin pill-box hat 
 Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you, it's bad for your health, he said 
 Yes, I disobeyed his orders, I came to see you, but I found him there instead 
 You know, I don't mind him cheatin' on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head 
 Your brand new, leopard-skin pill-box hat 
 Well, I see you got a new boyfriend, no, I never seen him before 
 Well, I saw you makin' love with him, you forgot to close the garage door 
 You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for 
 It's your brand new, leopard-skin pill-box hat"
74,Bob Dylan,rock,Just Like A Woman,"Nobody feels any pain 
 Tonight as I stand inside the rain 
 Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes 
 But lately I see her ribbons and her bows 
 Have fallen from her curls 
 She takes just like a woman 
 Yes, she does, she makes love just like a woman 
 Yes, she does, and she aches just like a woman 
 But she breaks just like a little girl 
 Queen Mary, she's my friend 
 Yes, I believe I'll go see her again 
 Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed 
 'Til she finally sees that she's like all the rest 
 With her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls 
 She takes just like a woman 
 Yes, she makes love just like a woman 
 Yes, she does, and she aches just like a woman 
 But she breaks just like a little girl 
 It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst 
 So I came in here 
 And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse 
 Is this pain in here, I can't stay in here, ain't it clear 
 That I just can't fit 
 Yes, I believe that it's time for us to quit 
 But when we meet again, introduced as friends 
 Please don't let on that you knew me when 
 I was hungry and it was your world 
 Ah, you fake just like a woman 
 Yes, you do, you make love just like a woman 
 Yes, you do, then you ache just like a woman 
 But you break just like a little girl"
75,Bob Dylan,rock,Most Likely You Go Your Way (And I'll Go Mine),"You say you love me 
 And you're thinkin' of me 
 But you know you could be wrong 
 You say you told me 
 That you wanna hold me 
 But you know you're not that strong 
 I just can't do what I done before 
 I just can't beg you any more 
 I'm gonna let you pass 
 And I'll go last 
 Then time will tell just who fell 
 And who's been left behind 
 When you go your way and I go mine 
 You say you disturb me 
 And you don't deserve me 
 But you know sometimes you lie 
 You say you're shakin' 
 And you're always achin' 
 But you know how hard you try 
 Sometimes it gets so hard to care 
 It can't be this way ev'rywhere 
 And I'm gonna let you pass 
 Yes, and I'll go last 
 Then time will tell just who fell 
 And who's been left behind 
 When you go your way and I go mine 
 The judge, he holds a grudge 
 He's gonna call on you 
 But he's badly built 
 And he walks on stilts 
 Watch out he don't fall on you 
 You say you're sorry 
 For tellin' stories 
 That you know I believe are true 
 You say ya got some 
 Other kinda lover 
 And yes, I believe you do 
 You say my kisses are not like his 
 But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is 
 I'm just gonna let you pass 
 Yes, and I'll go last 
 Then time will tell who fell 
 And who's been left behind 
 When you go your way and I go mine"
76,Bob Dylan,rock,Temporary Like Achilles,"Standing on your window, honey, yes, I've been here before 
 Feeling so harmless, I'm looking at your second door 
 How come you don't send me no regards? 
 You know I want your lovin', honey, why are you hard? 
 Kneeling 'neath your ceiling, yes, I guess I've been here for a while 
 I'm tryin' to read your portrait, but I'm helpless like a rich man's child 
 How come you send someone out to have me barred? 
 You know I want your lovin', honey, why are you hard? 
 Like a poor fool in his prime 
 Yes, I know you can hear me walk 
 But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime 
 Or is it just solid rock? 
 Well, I lean into your hallway, lean against your velvet door 
 I watch upon your scorpion who crawls across your circus floor 
 Just what do you think you have to guard? 
 You know I want your lovin', honey, but you're so hard 
 Achilles is in your alleyway, he don't want me here, he does brag 
 He's pointing to the sky and he's hungry, like a man in drag 
 How come you get someone like him to be your guard? 
 You know I want your lovin', honey, but you're so hard"
77,Bob Dylan,rock,Absolutely Sweet Marie,"Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can't jump it 
 Sometimes it gets so hard, you see 
 I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet 
 With all these promises you left for me 
 But where are you tonight, Sweet Marie? 
 Well, I waited for you when I was a-half sick 
 Yes, I waited for you when you hated me 
 Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic 
 When you knew I had some other place to be 
 Now, where are you tonight, Sweet Marie? 
 Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously 
 But then, now again, not too many can be like you, fortunately 
 Well, six white horses that you did promise 
 Were finally delivered down to the penitentiary 
 But to live outside the law, you must be honest 
 I know you always say that you agree 
 Alright, so where are you tonight, Sweet Marie? 
 Well, I don't know how it happened 
 But the river-boat captain, he knows my fate 
 But everybody else, even yourself 
 They're just gonna have to wait 
 Well, I got the fever down in my pockets 
 The Persian drunkard, he follows me 
 Yes, I can take him to your house but I can't unlock it 
 You see, you forgot to leave me with the key 
 Ah, where are you tonight, Sweet Marie? 
 Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed 
 That a man can't give his address out to bad company 
 And now I stand here lookin' at your yellow railroad 
 In the ruins of your balcony 
 Wondering where you are tonight, Sweet Marie"
78,Bob Dylan,rock,4th Time Around,"When she said, ""Don't waste your words, they're just lies,"" I cried she was deaf 
 And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes, and said, ""What else you got left?"" 
 It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, ""Don't forget 
 Everybody must give something back for something they get"" 
 I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come 
 And she buttoned her boot, and straightened her suit, and she said, ""Don't get cute"" 
 So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs 
 And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum 
 She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked 
 And after finding out I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked 
 I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense 
 Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against 
 Her Jamaica rum, and when she did come, I asked her for some 
 She said, ""No, dear,"" I said, ""Your words aren't clear, you'd better spit out your gum"" 
 She screamed 'til her face got so red, then she fell on the floor 
 And I covered up and then thought I'd go look through her drawer 
 And when I was through, I filled up my shoe and brought it to you 
 And you, you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time 
 And I, I never took much, I never asked for your crutch 
 Now don't ask for mine"
79,Bob Dylan,rock,Obviously 5 Believers,"Early in the mornin', early in the mornin'

 I won't let you down, I won't let you down, no I won't 
 You know I can if you can, honey 
 But, honey, please don't

 Five believers, five believers all dressed like men 
 Tell your mama not to worry because 
 Yes, they're just my friends 
 Early in the mornin', early in the mornin'

80,Bob Dylan,rock,Sad Eyed Lady Of The Lowlands,"With your mercury mouth in the missionary times 
 And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes 
 And your silver cross and your voice like chimes 
 Oh, who do they think could bury you? 
 With your pockets well-protected at last 
 And your streetcar visions which you place on the grass 
 And your flesh like silk and your face like glass 
 Who could they get to carry you? 
 Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands 
 Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes 
 My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums 
 Should I put them by your gate, or sad-eyed lady, should I wait? 
 With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace 
 And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace 
 And your basement clothes and your hollow face 
 Who among them did think he could outguess you? 
 With your silhouette when the sunlight dims 
 Into your eyes where the moonlight swims 
 And your matchbook songs and your gypsy hymns 
 Who among them would try to impress you? 
 Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands 
 Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes 
 My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums 
 Should I put them by your gate, or sad-eyed lady, should I wait? 
 The kings of Tyrus, with their convict list 
 Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss 
 And you wouldn't know it would have happened like this 
 But who among them really wants just to kiss you? 
 With your childhood flames on your midnight rug 
 And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs 
 And your cowboy mouth and your curfew plugs 
 Who among them do you think could resist you? 
 Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands 
 Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes 
 My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums 
 Should I put them by your gate, or sad-eyed lady, should I wait? 
 Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide 
 To show you where the dead angels are that they used to hide 
 But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side? 
 How could they ever mistake you? 
 They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm 
 But with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm 
 And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms 
 How could they ever have persuaded you? 
 Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands 
 Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man's come 
 My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums 
 Should I put them by your gate, or sad-eyed lady, should I wait? 
 With your sheet metal memory of Cannery Row 
 And your magazine husband who one day just had to go 
 And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show 
 Who among them do you think would employ you? 
 Now you stand with your thief, you're on his parole 
 With your holy medallion in your fingertips now enfold 
 And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul 
 Who among them could ever think he could destroy you? 
 Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands 
 Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes 
 My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums 
 Should I put them by your gate, or sad-eyed lady, should I wait?"
81,Bob Dylan,rock,John Wesley Harding,"John Wesley Harding was a friend to the poor 
 He traveled with a gun in every hand 
 All along this countryside he opened many a door 
 But he was never known to hurt an honest man 
 'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about 
 With his lady by his side he took a stand 
 And soon the situation there was all but straightened out 
 For he was always known to lend a helping hand 
 All across the telegraph his name, it did resound 
 But no charge held against him could they prove 
 And there was no man around who could track or chain him down 
 He was never known to make a foolish move"
82,Bob Dylan,rock,As I Went Out One Morning,"As I went out one morning 
 To breathe air around Tom Paine's 
 I spied the fairest damsel 
 That ever did walk in chains 
 I offered her my hand 
 She took me by the arm 
 I knew that very instant 
 She meant to do me harm 
 ""Depart from me this moment"" 
 I told her with my voice 
 Said she, ""But I don't wish to"" 
 Said I, ""But you have no choice"" 
 ""I beg you, sir,"" she pleaded 
 From the corners of her mouth 
 ""I will secretly accept you 
 And together we'll fly south"" 
 Just then, Tom Paine himself 
 Came running from across the field 
 Shouting at this lovely girl 
 And commanding her to yield 
 And as she was letting go her grip 
 Up Tom Paine did run 
 ""I'm sorry, sir,"" he said to me 
 ""I'm sorry for what she's done"""
83,Bob Dylan,rock,I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine,"I dreamed I saw St. Augustine 
 Alive as you or me 
 Tearing through these quarters in 
 The utmost misery 
 With a blanket underneath his arm 
 And a coat of solid gold 
 Searching for the very souls 
 Whom already have been sold 
 ""Arise, arise,"" he cried so loud 
 With a voice without restraint 
 ""Come out, ye gifted kings and queens 
 And hear my sad complaint 
 No martyr is among ye now 
 Whom you can call your own 
 But go on your way accordingly 
 But know you're not alone"" 
 I dreamed I saw St. Augustine 
 Alive with fiery breath 
 And I dreamed I was amongst the ones 
 That put him out to death 
 Oh, I awoke in anger 
 So alone and terrified 
 I put my fingers against the glass 
 And bowed my head and cried"
84,Bob Dylan,rock,All Along The Watchtower,"""There must be some way out of here"" 
 Said the joker to the thief 
 ""There's too much confusion 
 I can't get no relief 
 Businessmen, they drink my wine 
 Plowmen dig my earth 
 None of them along the line 
 Know what any of it is worth"" 
 ""No reason to get excited"" 
 The thief, he kindly spoke 
 ""There are many here among us 
 Who feel that life is but a joke 
 But you and I, we've been through that 
 And this is not our fate 
 So let us not talk falsely now 
 The hour is getting late"" 
 All along the watchtower 
 Princes kept the view 
 While all the women came and went 
 Barefoot servants too 
 Outside in the distance 
 A wildcat did growl 
 Two riders were approaching 
 The wind began to howl"
85,Bob Dylan,rock,The Ballad Of Frankie Lee And Judas Priest,"Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest, they were the best of friends 
 So when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens 
 And placed them on a footstool just above the potted plain 
 Sayin', ""Take your pick, Frankie Boy, my loss will be your gain"" 
 Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin 
 But with the cold eyes of Judas on him, his head began to spin 
 ""Could you please not stare at me like that?"" he said, ""it's just my foolish pride 
 But sometimes a man must be alone, and this is no place to hide"" 
 Well, Judas, he just winked and said, ""Alright, I'll leave you here 
 But you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear"" 
 ""I'm gonna start my pickin' right now, just tell me where you'll be"" 
 Judas pointed down the road and said, ""Eternity"" 
 ""Eternity?"" said Frankie Lee, with a voice as cold as ice 
 ""That's right,"" said Judas, ""Eternity, though you might call it paradise"" 
 ""I don't call it anything,"" said Frankie Lee with a smile 
 ""Alright,"" said Judas Priest, ""I'll see you after a while"" 
 Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feelin' low and mean 
 When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene 
 Saying, ""Are you Frankie Lee the gambler, whose father's deceased? 
 Well, if you are, there's a fellow callin' you down the road and they say his name is Priest"" 
 ""Oh, yes, he is my friend,"" said Frankie Lee in fright 
 ""I do recall him very well, in fact he just left my sight"" 
 ""Yes, that's the one,"" said the stranger, as quiet as a mouse 
 ""Oh, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house"" 
 Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked, he dropped everything and ran 
 Until he came unto the spot where Judas Priest did stand 
 ""What kind of house is this,"" he said, ""Where I have come to roam?"" 
 ""It's not a house,"" says Judas Priest, ""it's not a house, it's a home"" 
 Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled, he soon lost all control 
 Over everything which he had made while the mission bells did toll 
 He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun 
 With four and twenty windows and a woman's face in every one 
 Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap 
 And foaming at the mouth, he began to make his midnight creep 
 For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst 
 Into the arms of Judas Priest, which is where he died of thirst 
 No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest 
 Except, of course, the little neighbor boy who carried him to rest 
 And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed 
 And muttered underneath his breath, ""Nothing is revealed"" 
 Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song 
 Is simply that one should never be where one does not belong 
 So when you see your neighbor carrying somethin', help him with his load 
 And don't go mistaking paradise for that home across the road"
86,Bob Dylan,rock,Drifter's Escape,"""Oh, help me in my weakness,"" I heard the drifter say 
 As they carried him from the courtroom and were taking him away 
 ""My trip hasn't been a pleasant one, and my time, it isn't long 
 And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong"" 
 Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside, a tear came to his eye 
 ""You'd fail to understand,"" he said, ""Why must you even try?"" 
 Outside the crowd was stirring, you could hear it from the door 
 Inside the judge was stepping down while the jury cried for more 
 ""Oh, stop that cursed jury,"" cried the attendant and the nurse 
 ""The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse"" 
 Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape 
 And while everybody knelt to pray, the drifter did escape"
87,Bob Dylan,rock,Dear Landlord,"Dear landlord 
 Please don't put a price on my soul 
 My burden is heavy 
 My dreams are beyond control 
 When that steamboat whistle blows 
 I'm gonna give you all I got to give 
 And I do hope you receive it well 
 Depending on the way you feel that you live 
 Dear landlord 
 Please heed these words that I speak 
 I know you've suffered much 
 But in this you are not so unique 
 All of us, at times, we might work too hard 
 To have it too fast and too much 
 And anyone can fill his life up with things 
 He can see but he just cannot touch 
 Dear landlord 
 Please don't dismiss my case 
 I'm not about to argue 
 I'm not about to move to no other place 
 Now, each of us has his own special gift 
 And you know this was meant to be true 
 And if you don't underestimate me 
 I won't underestimate you"
88,Bob Dylan,rock,I Am A Lonesome Hobo,"I am a lonesome hobo without family or friends 
 Where another man's life might begin, that's exactly where mine ends 
 I have tried my hand at bribery, blackmail, and deceit 
 And I've served time for everything 'cept beggin' on the street 
 Well, once I was rather prosperous, there was nothing I did lack 
 I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth and silk upon my back 
 But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame 
 Which led me to my fatal doom, to wander off in shame 
 Kind ladies and kind gentlemen, soon I will be gone 
 But let me just warn you all, before I do pass on 
 Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code 
 And hold your judgment for yourself, lest you wind up on this road"
89,Bob Dylan,rock,I Pity The Poor Immigrant,"I pity the poor immigrant 
 Who wishes he would've stayed home 
 Who uses all his power to do evil 
 But in the end is always left so alone 
 That man whom with his fingers cheats 
 And whom lies with every breath 
 Who passionately hates his life 
 And likewise fears his death 
 I pity the poor immigrant 
 Whose strength is spent in vain 
 Whose heaven is like Ironsides 
 Whose tears are like rain 
 Who eats but is not satisfied 
 Who hears but does not see 
 Who falls in love with wealth itself 
 And turns his back on me 
 I pity the poor immigrant 
 Who tramples through the mud 
 Who fills his mouth with laughing 
 And who builds his town with blood 
 Whose visions in the final end 
 Must shatter like the glass 
 I pity the poor immigrant 
 When his gladness comes to pass"
90,Bob Dylan,rock,The Wicked Messenger,"There was a wicked messenger, from Eli he did come 
 With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter 
 When questioned who had sent for him, he answered with his thumb 
 For his tongue, it could not speak, but only flatter 
 He stayed behind the assembly hall, it was there he made his bed 
 Oftentimes he could be seen returning 
 Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand which read 
 ""The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning"" 
 Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part 
 And the people that confronted him were many 
 And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart 
 ""If you cannot bring good news, then don't bring any"""
91,Bob Dylan,rock,Down Along The Cove,"Down along the cove, I spied my true love comin' my way 
 Down along the cove, I spied my true love comin' my way 
 I said, ""Lord have mercy, mama 
 It sure is good to see you comin' today"" 
 Down along the cove, I spied my little bundle of joy 
 Down along the cove, I spied my little bundle of joy 
 She said, ""Lord have mercy, honey 
 I'm so glad you're my boy"" 
 Down along the cove, we walked together hand in hand 
 Down along the cove, we walked together hand in hand 
 Everybody watchin' us go by 
 Knows we're in love, yes, they understand"
92,Bob Dylan,rock,I'll Be Your Baby Tonight,"Close your eyes, close the door 
 You don't have to worry anymore 
 I'll be your baby tonight 
 Shut the light, shut the shade 
 You don't have to be afraid 
 I'll be your baby tonight 
 Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away 
 We're gonna forget it 
 That big fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon 
 But we're gonna let it, you won't regret it 
 Kick your shoes off, do not fear 
 Bring that bottle over here 
 I'll be your baby tonight"
93,Bob Dylan,rock,To Be Alone With You,"To be alone with you 
 Just you and me 
 Now won't you tell me true 
 Ain't that the way it ought to be? 
 To hold each other tight 
 The whole night through 
 Everything is always right 
 When I'm alone with you 
 To be alone with you 
 At the close of the day 
 With only you in view 
 While evening slips away 
 It only goes to show 
 That while life's pleasure's with you 
 The only one I know 
 Is when I'm alone with you 
 They say the night time is the right time 
 To be with the one you love 
 Too many thoughts get in the way in the day 
 But you're always what I'm thinking of 
 I wish the night was here 
 Bringing me all of your charms 
 When only you are near 
 To hold me in your arms 
 I'll always thank the Lord 
 When my working day is through 
 I get my sweet reward 
 To be alone with you"
94,Bob Dylan,rock,I Threw It All Away,"I once held her in my arms 
 She said she would always stay 
 But I was cruel, I treated her like a fool 
 I threw it all away 
 Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand 
 And rivers that ran through every day 
 I must have been mad, I never knew what I had 
 Until I threw it all away 
 Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round 
 Love and only love, it can't be denied 
 No matter what you think about it, you just won't be able to do without it 
 Take a tip from one who's tried 
 So if you find someone that gives you all of her love 
 Take it to your heart, don't let it stray 
 One thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurtin' 
 If you throw it all away, if you throw it all away"
95,Bob Dylan,rock,Peggy Day,"Peggy Day stole my poor heart away 
 By golly, what more can I say? 
 Love to spend the night with Peggy Day 
 Peggy Night makes my future look so bright 
 Man, that girl is out of sight 
 Love to spend the day with Peggy Night 
 Well, you know ever even before I learned her name 
 You know I loved her just the same 
 And I tell 'em all, wherever I may go, just so they'll know 
 That she's my little lady and I love her so 
 Peggy Day stole my poor heart away 
 Turned my skies to blue from gray 
 Love to spend the night with Peggy Day 
 Peggy Day stole my poor heart away 
 By golly, what more can I say? 
 Love to spend the night with Peggy Day 
 Love to spend the night with Peggy Day"
96,Bob Dylan,rock,Lay Lady Lay,"Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed 
 Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed 
 Whatever colors you have in your mind 
 I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine 
 Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed 
 Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile 
 Until the break of day, let me see you make him smile 
 His clothes are dirty but his hands are clean 
 And you're the best thing that he's ever seen 
 Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile 
 Why wait any longer for the world to begin? 
 You can have your cake and eat it too 
 Why wait any longer for the one you love? 
 When he's standing in front of you 
 Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed 
 Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead 
 I long to see you in the morning light 
 I long to reach for you in the night 
 Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead"
97,Bob Dylan,rock,One More Night,"One more night, the stars are in sight 
 But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be 
 Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight 
 But tonight no light will shine on me 
 Oh, it's shameful and it's sad, I lost the only pal I had 
 I just could not be what she wanted me to be 
 I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky 
 But tonight no light will shine on me 
 I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true 
 I had no idea what a woman in love would do 
 One more night, I will wait for the light 
 While the wind blows high above the tree 
 Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go 
 But tonight no light will shine on me 
 One more night, the moon is shining bright 
 And the wind blows high above the tree 
 Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go 
 But tonight no light will shine on me"
98,Bob Dylan,rock,Tell Me That It Isn't True,"I have heard rumors all over town 
 They say that you're planning to put me down 
 All I'd like you to do 
 Is tell me that it isn't true 
 They say that you've been seen with some other man 
 That he's tall, dark, and handsome, and you're holding his hand 
 Darling, I'm a-countin' on you 
 Tell me that it isn't true 
 To know that some other man 
 Is holding you tight 
 It hurts me all over 
 It doesn't seem right 
 All of these awful things that I have heard 
 I don't want to believe them, all I want is your word 
 So darlin' you better come through 
 Tell me that it isn't true 
 All of these awful things that I have heard 
 I don't want to believe them, all I want is your word 
 So darlin' I'm countin' on you 
 Tell me that it isn't true"
99,Bob Dylan,rock,Country Pie,"Just like old Saxophone Joe 
 When he's got the hogshead up on his toe 
 Oh me, oh my 
 Love that country pie 
 Listen to the fiddler play 
 When he's playin' 'til the break of day 
 Oh me, oh my 
 Love that country pie 
 Raspberry, strawberry, lemon and lime 
 What do I care? 
 Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum 
 Call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there 
 Saddle me up a big white goose 
 Tie me on her and turn her loose 
 Oh me, oh my 
 Love that country pie 
 I don't need much, that ain't no lie 
 Ain't runnin' any race 
 Give to me my country pie 
 I won't throw it up in anybody's face 
 Shake me up that old peach tree 
 Little Jack Horner got nothin' on me 
 Oh me, oh my 
 Love that country pie"
100,Bob Dylan,rock,Tonight I'll Be Staying Here With You,"Throw my ticket out the window 
 Throw my suitcase out there too 
 Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore 
 'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you 
 I should have left this town this morning 
 But it was more than I could do 
 For your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long 
 For tonight when I'll be staying here with you 
 Is it really any wonder 
 The love that a stranger might receive? 
 You cast your spell and I went under 
 I find it so difficult to leave 
 I can hear that whistle blowin' 
 I see that stationmaster too 
 If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat 
 'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you 
 Throw my ticket out the window 
 Throw my suitcase out there too 
 Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore 
 'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you"

 How'm I supposed to get any ridin' done? Hmm. 
 All the tired horses in the sun 
 How'm I supposed to get any ridin' done? Hmm. 
 All the tired horses in the sun 
 How'm I supposed to get any ridin' done? Hmm. 
 All the tired horses in the sun 
 How'm I supposed to get any ridin' done? Hmm. 
 All the tired horses in the sun 
 How'm I supposed to get any ridin' done? Hmm."
102,Bob Dylan,rock,Alberta #1,"Alberta let your hair hang low 
 Alberta let your hair hang low 
 I'll give you more gold 
 Than your apron can hold 
 If you'd only let your hair hang low 
 Alberta what's on your mind 
 Alberta what's on your mind 
 You keep me worried and bothered 
 All of the time 
 Alberta what's on your mind 
 Alberta don't you treat me unkind 
 Alberta don't you treat me unkind 
 Oh my heart is so sad 
 'Cause I want you so bad 
 Alberta don't you treat me unkind

103,Bob Dylan,rock,I Forgot More Than You'll Ever Know,"I forgot more than you'll ever know about her 
 You think you know the smile on her lips 
 The thrill and the touch of her fingertips 
 But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her 
 You think you'll find heaven of bliss 
 In each caress, in each tender kiss 
 But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her 
 You stole her love from me one day 
 You didn't care, oh, it hurt me 
 But you can never steal away memories of what used to be 
 You think she's yours, to have and to hold 
 Someday you'll learn, when her love grows cold 
 But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her"
104,Bob Dylan,rock,Days Of 49,"I'm ol' Tom Moore from the bummers' shore 
 In the good ol' golden days 
 They call me a bummer and a ginsot too 
 But what cares I for praise 
 I wander round from town to town 
 Just like a rovin' sign 
 And all the people say 
 There goes Tom Moore in the days of '49. 
 In the days of old, in the days of gold 
 How often times I repine 
 For the days of old when we dug up the gold 
 In the days of '49. 
 My comrades they all loved me well 
 A jolly saucy crew 
 A few hard cases I will recall 
 Though they all were brave and true 
 Whatever the pitch they never would flinch 
 They never would fret or whine 
 Like good old bricks they stood the kicks 
 In the days of '49. 
 In the days of old, in the days of gold 
 How oftimes I repine 
 For the days of old when we dug up the gold 
 In the days of '49. 
 There was New York Jake the butcher's boy 
 He was always gettin' tight 
 And every time that he'd got booked 
 He was spoiling for a fight 
 That Jake rampaged against a knife 
 In the hands of ol' Bob Stein 
 An' over Jake they held a wake 
 In the days of '49. 
 In the days of old, in the days of gold 
 How often times I repine 
 For the days of old when we dug up the gold 
 In the days of '49. 
 There was Poker Bill one of the boys 
 Who was always in a game 
 Whether he lost or whether he won 
 To him it was always the same 
 He would ante up and draw his cards 
 And he would you go a hatful blind 
 In a game with death, Bill lost his breath 
 In the days of '49. 
 In the days of old, in the days of gold 
 In the days times I repine 
 In the days of old, in the days of gold 
 Those were days of '49. 
 There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo 
 I never will forget 
 He would roar all day and he'd roar all night 
 And I guess he's roarin' yet 
 One day he fell in a prospect hole 
 In a roarin' bad design 
 And in that hole he roared out his soul 
 In the days of '49. 
 In the days of old, in the days of gold 
 How oftimes I repine 
 For the days of old when we dug up the gold 
 In the days of '49. 
 Of the comrades all that I've had 
 There's none that's left to boast 
 And I'm left alone in my misery 
 Like some ol' poor wanderin' ghost 
 And I pass by from town to town 
 They call me the ramblin' sign 
 There goes Tom Moore, a-bummer's shore 
 In the days of '49. 
 In the days of old, in the days of gold 
 How often times I repine 
 For the days of old when we dug up the gold 
 In the days of '49. 
 In the days of old when we dug up the gold 
 How oftimes I repine 
 For the days of old, in the days of gold 
 In the days of '49."
105,Bob Dylan,rock,Early Mornin' Rain,"In the early morning rain, with a dollar in my hand 
 With an aching in my heart, and my pockets full of sand 
 I'm a long way from home, and I miss my loved ones so 
 In the early morning rain, with nowhere to go 
 Out on runway number nine, a big 707's set to go 
 I'm stuck here in the ground, where the cold wind blows 
 The liquor tasted good, and the women all were fast 
 There she goes my friend, she's rolling down at last 
 Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high 
 She's away and westward bound, far above the clouds she'll fly 
 Where the morning rain don't fall, and the sun always shines 
 She'll be flying over my home, in about three hours time 
 This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me 
 'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I might be 
 You can't jump a jet plane, like you can a freight train 
 So I'd best be on my way, in the early morning rain"
106,Bob Dylan,rock,In Search Of Little Sadie,"Went out last night just to take a little round 
 I met my little Sadie and I brought her down 
 I ran right home and I went to bed 
 With a .44 smokeless under my head. 
 I began to think what a deed I done 
 I grabbed my head and I began to run 
 I made a good run but I run too slow 
 They overtook me down in Jericho. 
 Standin' on the corner as he's ringin' my bell 
 Up stepped the sheriff of Thomasville 
 He says, ""Young man is your name Brown? 
 Remember you blowed little Sadie down?"" 
 ""Oh, yes sir my name is Lee 
 I murdered little Sadie in first degree"" 
 ""First degree and second degree 
 If you got any papers, will you serve them to me."" 
 Well they took me downtown and they dressed me in black 
 They put me on a train and they sent me back 
 I had no one for to go my bail 
 They crammed me back into the county jail, 
 Oh yes they did. 
 Now the judge and the jury they took their stand 
 The judge had the papers in his right hand 
 Forty-one days, forty-one nights 
 Forty-one years with the ball and stripes, oh no. 
 Went out last night to take a little round 
 I met my little Sadie and I blowed her down 
 I run right home and I went to bed 
 A .44 smokeless under my head"

 I want my arms around you 
 And so I beg you: Let it be me. 
 Don't take this heaven from one 
 If you must cling someone 
 Now and forever, let it be me. 
 Each time we meet, love 
 I find complete love 
 Without your sweet love, what would life be? 
 So never leave me lonely 
 Tell me that you love me only 
 And say you'll always let it be me."

109,Bob Dylan,rock,Belle Isle,"One evening for pleasure I rambled to view 
 The fair fields all alone 
 Down by the banks of Loch Eiron 
 Where beauty and pleasure were known. 
 I spied a fair maid at her labour 
 Which caused me to stay for a while 
 And I thought of a goddess to beauty 
 Bloomin' bright star of Bright Isle. 
 I humbled myself to her beauty 
 ""Fair maiden, where do you belong? 
 Are you from heaven descended 
 Abiding in Cupid's fair throne ?"" 
 ""Young man, I will tell you a secret 
 It's true I'm a maid that is poor 
 And to part from my vows and my promise 
 Is more than my heart can endure. 
 Therefore I remain at my service 
 And go through all my hardship and toil 
 And wait for the lad that has left me 
 All alone on the banks of Belle Isle"" 
 ""Young maiden I wish not to banter 
 It's true I come here in disguise 
 I came here to fulfill our last promise 
 And hope to give you a surprise. 
 I've known you're a maid I love dearly 
 And you've been in my heart all the while 
 For me there is no other damsel 
 Than my bloomin' bright star of Belle Isle"""
110,Bob Dylan,rock,Living The Blues,"Since you've been gone, 
 I've been walking around 
 With my head bowed down to my shoes. 
 I've been living the blues 
 Every night without you. 
 I don't have to go far 
 To know where you are, 
 Strangers all give me the news. 
 I've been living the blues 
 Every night without you. 
 I think that it's best, 
 I soon get some rest 
 And forget my pride. 
 But I can't deny 
 This feeling that I 
 Carry for you deep down inside. 
 If you see me this way, 
 You'd come back and you'd stay, 
 Oh, how could you refuse. 
 I've been living the blues 
 Every night without you"
111,Bob Dylan,rock,Copper Kettle,"Get you a copper kettle 
 Get you a copper coil 
 Fill it with new made corn mash 
 And never more you'll toil 
 You'll just lay there by the juniper 
 While the moon is bright 
 Watch them jugs a-filling 
 In the pale moonlight 
 Build you a fire with hickory 
 Hickory, ash, and oak 
 Don't use no green or rotten wood 
 It'll get you by the smoke 
 We'll just lay there by the juniper 
 While the moon is bright 
 Watch them jugs a-filling 
 In the pale moonlight 
 My daddy, he made whiskey 
 My granddaddy, he did too 
 We ain't paid no whiskey tax 
 Since 1792 
 We'll just lay there by the juniper 
 While the moon is bright 
 Watch them jugs a-filling 
 In the pale moonlight"

 And it seems like I gotta travel on. 
 And it seems like I gotta travel on. 
 That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way 
 Going home to stay, Going home to stay 
 That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way 
 And I feel like I just wanna travel on 
 Done laid around, done stayed around, this old town too long 
 Summer's almost gone, winter's comin' on 
 Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long 
 And it seems like I gotta travel on. 
 And it seems like I gotta travel on. 
 There's a lonesome freight at six'o eight, a comin' through the town 
 I'll be homeward bound, I'll be homeward bound 
 A lonesome freight at six'o eight comin' on through the town 
 And I'll feel like I just a want to travel on 
 Done laid around, done stayed around, this old town too long 
 Summer's almost gone, winter's comin' on 
 Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long 
 And it seems like I gotta travel on. 
 And it seems like I gotta travel on."
113,Bob Dylan,rock,Blue Moon,"Blue moon, you saw me standing alone 
 Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own. 
 Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for 
 You heard me saying a prayer for someone I really care for. 
 And suddenly there appeared before me the only one my arms could ever hold 
 I heard someone whisper, ""Please, adore me"" 
 And when I looked my moon had turned to gold. 
 Blue moon, now I'm no longer alone 
 Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own 
 Without a love of my own."
114,Bob Dylan,rock,The Boxer,"I am just a poor boy 
 Though my story's seldom told 
 I have squandered my resistance 
 For a pocketful of mumbles 
 Such are promises, all lies and jest 
 Still a man hears what he wants to hear 
 And disregards the rest. 
 When I left my home and family 
 I was no more than a boy 
 In the company of strangers 
 In the quiet of the railway station 
 Running scared, laying low 
 Seeking out the poorer quarters 
 Where the ragged people go 
 Looking for the places only they would know. 
 Asking only workman's wages 
 I come looking for a job 
 But I get no offers 
 Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue 
 I do declare 
 There were times when I was so lonesome 
 I took some comfort there. 
 Now the years go rushing by me 
 They are rocking evenly 
 I am older than I once was, 
 But I'm younger than I'll be, that's not unusual. 
 No it isn't strange. 
 After changes upon changes we are more, or less the same. 
 After changes we are more, or less the same. 
 Then I'm laying out my winter clothes 
 And wishing I was gone, going home 
 Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me 
 Leading me 
 Going home. 
 In the clearing stands a boxer 
 And a fighter by his trade 
 And he carries the reminders 
 Of every glove that laid him down 
 And cut him till he cried out 
 In his anger and his shame 
 ""I am leaving, I am leaving"" 
 But the fighter still remains."
115,Bob Dylan,rock,Quinn The Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn),"Everybody's building ships and boats 
 Some are building monuments 
 Others, jotting down notes 
 Everybody's in despair 
 Every girl and boy 
 But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here 
 Everybody's gonna jump for joy 
 Oh, come all without, come all within 
 You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn 
 Come all without, come all within 
 You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn 
 Oh y'know, I like to do just like the rest 
 Y'know, I like my sugar sweet 
 But jumping queues and making haste 
 Y'know, ain't my cup of meat 
 Everybody's out there 
 Feeding pigeons out on a limb 
 When Quinn the Eskimo gets here 
 The pigeons gonna run to him 
 Oh, come all without, come all within 
 Yeah, you'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn 
 Come all without, come all within 
 You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn 
 Whoa, guitar now 
 Cat's mew and cow's meow 
 Y'know, I can recite 'em all 
 Tell me where it hurts you, honey 
 I'll tell you who to call 
 Nobody can get any sleep 
 Y'know their stepping on everybody's toes 
 Quinn the Eskimo gets here 
 Everybody's gonna wanna dose 
 Oh, come all without, come all within 
 You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn 
 Oh, come all without, come all within 
 You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn"
116,Bob Dylan,rock,Take Me As I Am,"Why must you always try to make me over? 
 Take me as I am or let me go 
 White lilies never grow on stalks of clover 
 Take me as I am or let me go. 
 You're trying to reshape me in a moment 
 In the image of someone you used to know 
 I won't be a stand-in for an old love 
 Take me as I am or let me go. 
 You've tried to change me ever since you've met me 
 Take me as I am or let me go. 
 If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me 
 Take me as I am or let me go. 
 You're trying to reshape me in a mould love 
 In the image of someone you used to know 
 But I won't be a stand-in for an old love 
 Take me as I am or let me go."
117,Bob Dylan,rock,Take A Message To Mary,"These are the words of a frontier man 
 Who lost his love when he turned bad 
 Take a message to Mary 
 But don't tell here where I am 
 Take a message to Mary 
 But don't say I'm in a jam 
 You can tell her that I had to see the world 
 Tell her that my ship set sail 
 You can say she'd better not wait for me 
 But don't tell her I'm in jail, oh don't tell her I'm in jail 
 Take a message to Mary 
 But don't tell her what I've done 
 Please, don't mention the stage coach 
 And the shot from a carried gun 
 You better tell her that I had to change my plans 
 And cancel out the wedding-day 
 But please, don't mention the lonely cell 
 Where I'm gonna pine away, until my dying-day 
 Take a message to Mary 
 But don't tell her all you know 
 My heart is aching for Mary 
 Lord know I miss her so 
 Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu 
 Tell her I'm searching for gold 
 You can say she better find someone new 
 To cherish and to hold, oh Lord, this cell is so cold"
118,Bob Dylan,rock,It Hurts Me Too,"So run here baby, put your little hands in mine 
 I've got something to tell you 
 I know you're gonna change your mind 
 When things go wrong, so wrong with you 
 It hurts me too. 
 I want you, baby, just to understand 
 I don't wanna be your boss, baby 
 I just wanna be your man 
 When things go wrong, so wrong with you 
 It hurts me too. 
 Now when you go home, you don't have to get along 
 Come back to me, baby 
 Where I live that's where you belong 
 When things go wrong, so wrong with you 
 It hurts me too. 
 I love you baby, and you know that it's true 
 I wouldn't mistreat you, baby 
 Nothing in this world is like you 
 Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you 
 It hurts me too 
 When things go wrong, so wrong with you 
 It hurts me too. 
 So run here baby, put your little hands in mine 
 I've got something to tell you, baby 
 I know you're gonna change your mind 
 When things go wrong, so wrong with you 
 Don't you know, really, don't you know it hurts me too."
119,Bob Dylan,rock,Minstrel Boy,"Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin? 
 Who's gonna let it roll? 
 Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin? 
 Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul? 
 Oh, Lucky's been drivin' a long, long time 
 And now he's stuck on top of the hill 
 With twelve forward gears, it's been a long hard climb 
 And with all of them ladies, though, he's lonely still 
 Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin? 
 Who's gonna let it roll? 
 Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin? 
 Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul? 
 Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil 
 Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load 
 Beneath his boundaries, what more can I tell 
 With all of his travelin', but I'm still on that road 
 Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin? 
 Who's gonna let it roll? 
 Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin? 
 Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?"

 You keep me worried and bothered 
 All of the time

 Babe, I couldn't find the door 
 Couldn't even see the floor 
 I'd be sad and blue 
 If not for you 
 If not for you 
 Babe, I'd lay awake all night 
 Wait for the morning light 
 To shine in through 
 But it would not be new 
 If not for you 
 If not for you 
 My sky would fall 
 Rain would gather, too 
 Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all 
 I'd be lost if not for you 
 And you know it's true 
 If not for you 
 My sky would fall 
 Rain would gather, too 
 Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all 
 Oh, what would I do 
 If not for you 
 If not for you 
 Winter would have no spring 
 Couldn't hear the robin sing 
 I just wouldn't have a clue 
 Anyway, it wouldn't ring true 
 If not for you 
 If not for you 
 If not for you"
122,Bob Dylan,rock,Day Of The Locusts,"Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration 
 The birdies were flying from tree to tree 
 There was little to say, there was no conversation 
 As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree 
 And the locusts sang off in the distance 
 Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody 
 Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance 
 Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singin' for me 
 I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking 
 Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb 
 I was ready to leave, I was already walkin' 
 But the next time I looked there was light in the room 
 And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill 
 Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody 
 Oh, the locusts sang that high whining trill 
 Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singin' for me 
 Outside of the gates the trucks were unloadin' 
 The weather was hot, a-nearly 90 degrees 
 The man standin' next to me, his head was exploding 
 Whoa, I was prayin' the pieces wouldn't fall on me 
 Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance 
 Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody 
 Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance 
 Now, the locusts sang and they were singin' for me 
 I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma 
 Took hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive 
 Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota 
 Sure was glad to get out of there alive 
 And the locusts sang, whoa, it give me a chill 
 Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody 
 And the locusts sang with that high whinin' trill 
 Yeah, the locusts sang and they was singin' for me 
 Singin' for me, whoa, singin' for me"
123,Bob Dylan,rock,Time Passes Slowly,"Time passes slowly up here in the mountains 
 We sit beside bridges and walk beside fountains 
 Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream 
 Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream 
 Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-lookin' 
 We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cookin' 
 Starin' out the window to the stars high above 
 Time passes slow when you're searchin' for love 
 Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town 
 Ain't no reason to go to the fair 
 Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down 
 Ain't no reason to go anywhere 
 Time passes slowly up here in the daylight 
 Stare straight ahead and try so hard to stay right 
 Like a red rose of summer that blooms in the day 
 Time passes slowly then fades away"
124,Bob Dylan,rock,Went To See The Gypsy,"I went to see The Gypsy 
 Staying in a big hotel 
 He smiled when he saw me comin' an' he said: ""well, well, well"" 
 His room was dark and crowded 
 Lights were low and dim 
 ""How are you""? he said to me 
 I said it back to him 
 I went down to the lobby 
 To make a small call out 
 A pretty dancing girl was there and she began to shout 
 Go on back to see The Gypsy 
 He can move you from the rear 
 Drive you from your fear 
 Bring you through the mirror 
 He did it in Las Vegas 
 An' he can do it here 
 Outside the lights were shining 
 On the river of tears 
 I watched him from the distance with the music in my ears 
 I went back to see The Gypsy 
 It was nearly early dawn 
 The Gypsy's door was open wide but The Gypsy was gone 
 And that pretty dancing girl 
 She could not be found 
 So I watched that sun come rising from a little Minnesota town 
 From that little Minnesota town"
125,Bob Dylan,rock,Winterlude,"Winterlude, Winterlude, oh darlin' 
 Winterlude by the road tonight 
 Tonight there will be no quarrelin' 
 Ev'rything is gonna be all right 
 Oh, I see by the angel beside me 
 That love has a reason to shine 
 You're the one I adore, come over here and give me more 
 Then Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine 
 Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple 
 Winterlude by the corn in the field 
 Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel 
 Then come back and cook up a meal 
 Well, come out when the skating rink glistens 
 By the sun, near the old crossroads sign 
 The snow is so cold, but our love can be bold 
 Winterlude, this dude thinks your'e fine 
 Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy 
 Winterlude by the telephone wire 
 Winterlude, it's makin' me lazy 
 Come on, sit by the logs in the fire 
 The moonlight reflects from the window 
 Where the snowflakes, they cover the sand 
 Come out tonight, ev'rything will be tight 
 Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand"
126,Bob Dylan,rock,If Dogs Run Free,"If dogs run free, then why not we 
 Across the swooping plain? 
 My ears hear a symphony 
 Of two mules, trains and rain 
 The best is always yet to come 
 That's what they explain to me 
 Just do your thing, you'll be king 
 If dogs run free 
 If dogs run free, why not me 
 Across the swamp of time? 
 My mind weaves a symphony 
 And tapestry of rhyme 
 Oh, winds which rush my tale to thee 
 So it may flow and be 
 To each his own, it's all unknown 
 If dogs run free 
 If dogs run free, then what must be 
 Must be, and that is all 
 True love can make a blade of grass 
 Stand up straight and tall 
 In harmony with the cosmic sea 
 True love needs no company 
 It can cure the soul, it can make it whole 
 If dogs run free"
127,Bob Dylan,rock,New Morning,"Can't you hear that rooster crowin'? 
 Rabbit runnin' down across the road 
 Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through 
 So happy just to see you smile 
 Underneath the sky of blue 
 On this new morning, new morning 
 On this new morning with you 
 Can't you hear that motor turnin'? 
 Automobile comin' into style 
 Comin' down the road for a country mile or two 
 So happy just to see you smile 
 Underneath the sky of blue 
 On this new morning, new morning 
 On this new morning with you 
 The night passed away so quickly 
 It always does when you're with me 
 Can't you feel that sun a-shinin'? 
 Ground hog runnin' by the country stream 
 This must be the day that all of my dreams come true 
 So happy just to be alive 
 Underneath the sky of blue 
 On this new morning, new morning 
 On this new morning with you 
 So happy just to be alive 
 Underneath the sky of blue 
 On this new morning, new morning 
 On this new morning with you 
 New morning"

 Her and her boyfriend went to California 
 Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune 
 My best friend said, ""Now didn' I warn ya 
 Brighton girls are like the moon 
 Brighton girls are like the moon"" 
 Looks like a-nothing but rain 
 Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street 
 Hope that it don't sleet 
 Build me a cabin in Utah 
 Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout 
 Have a bunch of kids who call me ""Pa""

 That must be what it's all about"

130,Bob Dylan,rock,The Man In Me,"The man in me will do nearly any task 
 And as for compensation, there's a-little he would ask 
 Take a woman like you 
 To get through to the man in me 
 Storm clouds are raging all around my door 
 I think to myself I might not take it any more 
 Take a woman like your kind 
 To find the man in me 
 But, oh, what a wonderful feeling 
 Just to know that you are near 
 It sets my a heart a-reeling 
 From my toes up to my ears 
 The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from bein' seen 
 But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine 
 Took a woman like you 
 To get through to the man in me"
131,Bob Dylan,rock,Three Angels,"Three angels up above the street 
 Each one playing a horn 
 Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out 
 They've been there since Christmas morn 
 The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash 
 Then a lady in a bright orange dress 
 One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels 
 The Tenth Avenue bus goin' west 
 The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around 
 A man with a badge skips by 
 Three fellas crawlin' on their way back to work 
 Nobody stops to ask why 
 The bakery truck stops outside of that fence 
 Where the angels stand high on their poles 
 The driver peeks out, trying to find one face 
 In this concrete world full of souls 
 The angels play on their horns all day 
 The whole earth in progression seems to pass by 
 But does anyone hear the music they play 
 Does anyone even try?"
132,Bob Dylan,rock,Father Of Night,"Father of night, Father of day 
 Father, who taketh the darkness away 
 Father, who teacheth the bird to fly 
 Builder of rainbows up in the sky 
 Father of loneliness and pain 
 Father of love and Father of rain 
 Father of day, Father of night 
 Father of black, Father of white 
 Father, who build the mountain so high 
 Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky 
 Father of time, and Father of dreams 
 Father, who turneth the rivers and streams 
 Father of grain, Father of wheat 
 Father of cold and Father of heat 
 Father of air and Father of trees 
 Who dwells in our hearts and our memories 
 Father of minutes, Father of days 
 Father of whom we most solemnly praise"

 They say that Pat Garrett's got your number 
 So sleep with one eye open when you slumber 
 Every little sound just might be thunder

 There's always some new stranger sneakin' glances 
 Some trigger-happy fool willin' to take chances 
 And some old whore from San Pedro to make advances

 Billy, don't it make ya feel so low-down 
 To be shot down by the man who was your friend? 
 Hang on to your woman if you got one 
 Remember in El Paso, once, you shot one 
 She may have been a whore, but she was a hot one

137,Bob Dylan,rock,Lily Of The West,"When first I came to Louisville, some pleasure there to find 
 A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind 
 Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips, like arrows pierced my breast 
 The name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West 
 (And the name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West) 
 I courted lovely Flora, some pleasure for to find 
 But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind 
 She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me off my rest 
 Then go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West 
 (Then go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West) 
 'Way down in yonder shady grove, a man of high degree 
 Conversing with my Flora there, which seemed so strange to me 
 And the answer that she gave to him, it sore did me oppress 
 I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West 
 (I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West) 
 I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand 
 I seized him by the collar, and boldly made him stand 
 Being mad by desperation, I pierced him through the breast 
 All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West 
 (All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West) 
 I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea; 
 They placed me in the witness box, and then commenced on me 
 Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest 
 Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West 
 (Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West)"

 Like a river flows surely to the sea 
 Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be 
 Take my hand, take my whole life too 
 For I can't help falling in love with you

 Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be

 The engine gave a crack and the whistle gave a squall 
 Captain gone through the hole-in-the-wall 
 Oh Sarah Jane 
 Sarah Jane 
 Ain't nothin' to do 
 But to set down and sing 
 And rock about my Sarah Jane 
 Yankee built boats to shoot them Rebels 
 My gun's steady gonna hold it level 
 Sarah Jane 
 Sarah Jane 
 Ain't nothin' to do 
 But to set down and sing 
 And rock about my Sarah Jane 
 I've got a wife and five little children 
 I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan 
 Sarah Jane 
 Sarah Jane 
 Ain't nothin' to do 
 But to set down and sing 
 And rock about my Sarah Jane"
140,Bob Dylan,rock,The Ballad Of Ira Hayes,"Gather round me people and a story I will tell 
 About a brave young Indian you should remember well 
 From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band 
 They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona land 
 Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed 
 Till their white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed 
 Now Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds 
 But when war came he volunteers and forgot the white man's greed 
 Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore 
 Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war 
 Yes, call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore 
 Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war. 
 They started up Iwo Jima Hill, 250 men 
 But only 27 lived to walk back down that hill again 
 And when the fight was over and the Old Glory raised 
 One of the men who held it high was the Indian Ira Hayes 
 Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore 
 Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war 
 Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore 
 Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war 
 Now Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land 
 He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand 
 But he was just a Pima Indian, no money, no crops, no chance 
 And at home nobody cared what Ira had done and the when did the Indian's dance 
 Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore 
 Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war 
 Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore 
 Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war 
 And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home 
 They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone 
 He died drunk early one morning, alone in the land he had fought to save 
 Two inches of water in a lonely ditch was the grave for Ira Hayes 
 Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore 
 Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war 
 Yes, call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore 
 Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war 
 Yes, call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry 
 And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died 
 Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore 
 Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war 
 Yes, call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore 
 Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war"
141,Bob Dylan,rock,Mr. Bojangles,"I knew a man Bojangles and he'd dance for you in worn out shoes 
 Silver hair, a ragged shirt and baggy pants, that old soft shoe 
 He'd jump so high, he'd jump so high, will he likely touch down? 
 Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance. 
 I met him in a cell in New Orleans, I was down and out 
 He looked to me to be the eye of age as he spoke right out 
 He talked of life, he talked of life, laughing slapped his leg stale 
 Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance. 
 He said the name Bojangles and he danced a lick all across the cell 
 He grabbed his pants for a better stance, oh he jumped so high and he 
 Clicked up his heels 
 He let go laugh, he let go laugh, shook back his clothes all around 
 Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance, yeah, dance. 
 He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs through out the south 
 He spoke with tears of 15 years of how his dog and him just traveled about 
 Hid dog up and died, he up and died, and after 20 years he still grieves 
 Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance. 
 He said ""I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips 
 But most of the time I spend behind these county bars, 'cause I drinks a bit"" 
 He shook his head, yes he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, Please? 
 Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance, dance, Mr Bojangles, dance."
142,Bob Dylan,rock,Mary Ann,"Oh, fare thee well, my own true love, fare thee well but for a while 
 The ship is waiting and the wind blows high 
 And I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann. 
 (I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann) 
 Ten thousand miles away from home, ten thousand miles or more 
 The sea may freeze and the earth may burn 
 If I never no more return to you, Mary Ann. 
 (If I never no more return to you, Mary Ann.) 
 Oh, don't you see that crow fly high, she'll surely turn to white 
 If never I prove false to you 
 Let the day turn to night, my dear, Mary Ann. 
 (Day will turn to night, my dear, Mary Ann) 
 If I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two 
 And a great big bowl for to mix it in 
 I'd pour a drink for you, my dear, Mary Ann 
 Yes, I'd pour a drink for, you my dear, Mary Ann."
143,Bob Dylan,rock,Big Yellow Taxi,"They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot 
 A pink hotel, a boutique and a swinging hot spot 
 Don't it always go to show 
 You never know what you got till it's gone? 
 They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot. 
 They took all the trees, they put them in a tree museum 
 They charged the people a dollar and a half just to see them 
 Don't it always go to show 
 You never know what you got till it's gone? 
 They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot. 
 Hey farmer, farmer, put away that D.D.T 
 Give me spots on my apples but leave me the birds and the bees, please, 
 Don't it always go to show 
 You never know what you got till it's gone? 
 They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot. 
 Late last night I heard my screen door slam 
 A big yellow taxi took my girl away 
 Don't it always go to show 
 You never know what you got till it's gone? 
 They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot."
144,Bob Dylan,rock,A Fool Such As I,"Now and then there's a fool such as I 
 Pardon me if I'm sentimental, came to say goodbye 
 Don't be angry, don't be angry with me, should I cry 
 When you are gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by 
 Now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I. 
 Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you 
 You taught me how to love and now you happened to be untrue 
 I am a fool but I love you, dear, yes I will until the day I die. 
 Now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I. 
 Pardon me if I'm sentimental, came to say goodbye 
 Don't be angry, don't be angry with me, should I cry 
 When you are gone, when you are gone, I will dream a little 
 I will dream as years go by 
 Now and then, now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I. 
 Now and then there's a fool, a fool such as I am over you 
 You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through 
 I am a fool, yes, but I love you dear, I will love you dear 
 Till the day, till the day I die 
 Now and then, now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I. 
 Now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I. 
 Now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I."
145,Bob Dylan,rock,Spanish Is The Loving Tongue,"Broke my heart, lost my soul 
 Adios, mi corazon 
 Spanish is the loving tongue 
 Soft as music, light as spray 
 It was a girl I learned it from 
 Living down Sonora way 
 Well, I don't look much like a lover 
 Still I say her love words over 
 Mostly when I'm all alone 
 Mi amor, mi corazon. 
 Haven't seen her since that night 
 I can't cross the line you know 
 They want me for a gamblin' fight 
 Like as not it's better so 
 Still I always kind of missed her 
 Since that last sad night I kissed her 
 Broke her heart, lost my own 
 Adios, mi corazon 
 Broke her heart, lost my own 
 Adios, mi corazon 
 Adios, mi corazon 
 Adios, mi corazon"
146,Bob Dylan,rock,On A Night Like This,"On a night like this 
 So glad you came around 
 Hold on to me so tight 
 And heat up some coffee grounds 
 We got much to talk about 
 And much to reminisce 
 It sure is right 
 On a night like this 
 On a night like this 
 So glad you've come to stay 
 Hold on to me, pretty miss 
 Say you'll never go away to stray 
 Run your fingers down my spine 
 Bring me a touch of bliss 
 It sure feels right 
 On a night like this 
 On a night like this 
 I can't get any sleep 
 The air is so cold outside 
 And the snow's so deep 
 Build a fire, throw on logs 
 And listen to it hiss 
 And let it burn, burn, burn, burn 
 On a night like this 
 Put your body next to mine 
 And keep me company 
 There is plenty a room for all 
 So please don't elbow me 
 Let the four winds blow 
 Around this old cabin door 
 If I'm not too far off I think we did this once before 
 There's more frost on the window glass 
 With each new tender kiss 
 But it sure feels right 
 On a night like this"
147,Bob Dylan,rock,"Going, Going, Gone","I've just reached a place 
 Where the willow don't bend 
 There's not much more to be said 
 It's the top of the end 
 I'm going 
 I'm going 
 I'm gone 
 I'm closin' the book 
 On the pages and the text 
 And I don't really care 
 What happens next 
 I'm just going 
 I'm going 
 I'm gone 
 I been hangin' on threads 
 I been playin' it straight 
 Now, I've just got to cut loose 
 Before it gets late 
 So I'm going 
 I'm going 
 I'm gone 
 Grandma said, ""Boy, go and follow your heart 
 And you'll be fine at the end of the line 
 All that's gold isn't meant to shine 
 Don't you and your one true love ever part."" 
 I been walkin' the road 
 I been livin' on the edge 
 Now, I've just got to go 
 Before I get to the ledge 
 So I'm going 
 I'm just going 
 I'm gone"
148,Bob Dylan,rock,Tough Mama,"Tough Mama 
 Meat shakin' on your bones 
 I'm gonna go down to the river and get some stones 
 Sister's on the highway with that steel-drivin' crew 
 Papa's in the big house, his workin' days are through 
 Tough Mama 
 Can I blow a little smoke on you? 
 Dark Beauty 
 Won't you move it on over and make some room? 
 It's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom 
 Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise 
 You came through it all the way, flyin' through the skies 
 Dark Beauty 
 With that long night's journey in your eyes 
 Sweet Goddess 
 Born of a blinding light and a changing wind 
 Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you've been 
 Jack the Cowboy went up north 
 He's buried in your past 
 The Lone Wolf went out drinking 
 That was over pretty fast 
 Sweet Goddess 
 Your perfect stranger's comin' in at last 
 Silver Angel 
 With the badge of the lonesome road sewed in your sleeve 
 I'd be grateful if this golden ring you would receive 
 Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch 
 I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch 
 Sweet Goddess 
 It must be time to carve another notch 
 I'm crestfallen 
 The world of illusion is at my door 
 I ain't a-haulin' any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore 
 The prison walls are crumblin', there is no end in sight 
 I've gained some recognition but I lost my appetite 
 Dark Beauty 
 Meet me at the border late tonight"
149,Bob Dylan,rock,Hazel,"Hazel, dirty-blonde hair 
 I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere 
 You got something I want plenty of 
 Ooh, a little touch of your love 
 Hazel, stardust in your eye 
 You're goin' somewhere and so am I 
 I'd give you the sky high above 
 Ooh, for a little touch of your love 
 Oh no, I don't need any reminder 
 To know how much I really care 
 But it's just making me blinder and blinder 
 Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there 
 Hazel, you called and I came 
 Now don't make me play this waiting game 
 You've got something I want plenty of 
 Ooh, a little touch of your love"
150,Bob Dylan,rock,Something There Is About You,"Something there is about you that strikes a match in me 
 Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free? 
 Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be 
 Somethin' that crossed over from another century? 
 Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth 
 Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walkin' the hills of old Duluth 
 There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black night and then there was Ruth 
 Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth 
 Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings 
 Don't have to look no further, you're the soul of many things 
 I could say that I'd be faithful, I could say it in one sweet, easy breath 
 But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death 
 Something there is about you that moves with style and grace 
 I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place 
 My hand's on the sabre and you've picked up the baton 
 Somethin' there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on"
151,Bob Dylan,rock,Forever Young,"May God bless and keep you always 
 May your wishes all come true 
 May you always do for others 
 And let others do for you 
 May you build a ladder to the stars 
 And climb on every rung 
 And may you stay forever young 
 Forever young 
 Forever young 
 May you stay forever young 
 May you grow up to be righteous 
 May you grow up to be true 
 May you always know the truth 
 And see the light surrounding you 
 May you always be courageous 
 Stand upright and be strong 
 And may you stay forever young 
 Forever young 
 Forever young 
 May you stay forever young 
 May your hands always be busy 
 May your feet always be swift 
 May you have a strong foundation 
 When the winds of changes shift 
 May your heart always be joyful 
 May your song always be sung 
 And may you stay forever young 
 Forever young 
 Forever young 
 May you stay forever young"
152,Bob Dylan,rock,Dirge,"I hate myself for lovin' you 
 And the weakness that it showed 
 You were just a painted face 
 On a trip down Suicide Road 
 The stage was set, the lights went out 
 All around the old hotel 
 I hate myself for lovin' you 
 And I'm glad the curtain fell 
 I hate that foolish game we played 
 And the need that was expressed 
 And the mercy that you showed to me 
 Whoever would have guessed? 
 I went out on lower Broadway 
 And I felt that place within 
 That hollow place where martyrs weep 
 And angels play with sin 
 Heard your songs of freedom 
 And man forever stripped 
 Acting out his folly 
 While his back is being whipped 
 Like a slave in orbit 
 He's beaten till he's tame 
 All for a moment's glory 
 And it's a dirty, rotten shame 
 There are those who worship loneliness 
 I'm not one of them 
 In this age of fiberglass 
 I'm searching for a gem 
 The crystal ball up on the wall 
 Hasn't shown me nothing yet 
 I've paid the price of solitude 
 But at last I'm out of debt 
 I can't recall a useful thing 
 You ever did for me 
 'Cept pat me on the back one time 
 When I was on my knees 
 We stared into each other's eyes 
 Till one of us would break 
 No use to apologize 
 What difference would it make? 
 So sing your praise of progress 
 And of the doom machine 
 The naked truth is still taboo 
 Whenever it can be seen 
 Lady Luck, who shines on me 
 Will tell you where I'm at 
 I hate myself for lovin' you 
 But I should get over that"
153,Bob Dylan,rock,You Angel You,"You angel you 
 You got me under your wing 
 The way you walk and the way you talk 
 I feel I could almost sing. 
 You angel you 
 You're as fine as anything's fine 
 I just want to watch you talk 
 With your memory on my mind 
 You know, I can't sleep at night for trying. 
 Yes, I never did feel this way before 
 I never did get up and walk the floor 
 If this is love then give me more 
 And more and more and more and more. 
 You angel you 
 You're as fine as can be 
 The way you walk and the way you talk 
 Is the way it ought to be. 
 You know, I can't sleep at night for trying. 
 Never did feel this way before 
 Never did get up and walk the floor 
 If this is love then give me more 
 And more and more and more and more. 
 You angel you 
 You got me under your wing 
 The way you walk and the way you talk 
 I swear it makes me sing."
154,Bob Dylan,rock,Never Say Goodbye,"Twilight on the frozen lake 
 North wind about to break 
 On footprints in the snow 
 Silence down below. 
 You're beautiful beyond words 
 You're beautiful to me 
 You can make me cry 
 Never say goodbye. 
 Time is all I have to give 
 You can have it if you choose 
 With me you can live 
 Never say goodbye. 
 My dreams are made of iron and steel 
 With a big bouquet 
 Of roses hanging down 
 From the heavens to the ground. 
 The crashing waves roll over me 
 As I stand upon the sand 
 Wait for you to come 
 And grab hold of my hand. 
 Oh, baby, baby, baby blue 
 You'll change your last name, too 
 You've turned your hair to brown 
 Love to see it hangin' down."
155,Bob Dylan,rock,Wedding Song,"I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love, 
 I love you more than money and more than the stars above, 
 Love you more than madness, more than waves upon the sea, 
 Love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me. 
 Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete, 
 I've said goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street, 
 To the courtyard of the jester which is hidden from the sun, 
 I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun. 
 You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live, 
 When I was deep in poverty you taught me how to give, 
 Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole, 
 Quenched my thirst and satisfied the burning in my soul. 
 You gave me babies one, two, three, what is more, you saved my life, 
 Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife, 
 My thoughts of you don't ever rest; they'd kill me if I lie, 
 I'd sacrifice the world for you and watch my senses die. 
 The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth, 
 We'll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth, 
 What's lost is lost; we can't regain what went down in the flood, 
 But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood. 
 It's never been my duty to remake the world at large, 
 Nor is it my intention to sound a battle charge, 
 'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend, 
 And if there is eternity I'd love you there again. 
 Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side. 
 And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride, 
 You're the other half of what I am; you're the missing piece. 
 And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease. 
 You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see, 
 Just bein' next to you is a natural thing for me. 
 And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on, 
 'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone."
156,Bob Dylan,rock,Tangled Up In Blue,"Early one morning, the sun was shining 
 I was laying in bed 
 Wondering if she'd changed it all 
 If her hair was still red 
 Her folks, they said our lives together 
 Sure was gonna be rough 
 They never did like mama's homemade dress 
 Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough 
 And I was standing on the side of the road 
 Rain falling on my shoes 
 Heading out for the east coast 
 Lord knows I've paid some dues getting through 
 Tangled up in blue 
 She was married when we first met 
 Soon to be divorced 
 I helped her out of a jam, I guess 
 But I used a little too much force 
 We drove that car as far as we could 
 Abandoned it out west 
 Split up on a dark, sad night 
 Both agreeing it was best 
 She turned around to look at me 
 As I was walking away 
 I heard her say over my shoulder 
 ""We'll meet again someday on the avenue"" 
 Tangled up in blue 
 I had a job in the great north woods 
 Working as a cook for a spell 
 But I never did like it all that much 
 And one day the axe just fell 
 So I drifted down to New Orleans 
 Where I's lucky for to be employed 
 Working for a while on a fishing boat 
 Right outside of Delacroix 
 But all the while I was alone 
 The past was close behind 
 I seen a lot of women 
 But she never escaped my mind and I just grew 
 Tangled up in blue 
 She was working in a topless place 
 And I stopped in for a beer 
 I just kept looking at the sight of her face 
 In the spotlight so clear 
 And later on when the crowd thinned out 
 I's just about to do the same 
 She was standing there in back of my chair 
 Said, ""Tell me, don't I know your name?"" 
 I muttered something underneath my breath 
 She studied the lines on my face 
 I must admit I felt a little uneasy 
 When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe 
 Tangled up in blue 
 She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe 
 ""I thought you'd never say hello,"" she said 
 ""You look like the silent type"" 
 Then she opened up a book of poems 
 And handed it to me 
 Written by an Italian poet 
 From the thirteenth century 
 And every one of them words rang true 
 And glowed like burning coal 
 Pouring off of every page 
 Like it was written in my soul from me to you 
 Tangled up in blue 
 I lived with them on Montague Street 
 In a basement down the stairs 
 There was music in the cafés at night 
 And revolution in the air 
 Then he started into dealing with slaves 
 And something inside of him died 
 She had to sell everything she owned 
 And froze up inside 
 And when finally the bottom fell out 
 I became withdrawn 
 The only thing I knew how to do 
 Was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew 
 Tangled up in blue 
 So now I'm going back again 
 I got to get her somehow 
 All the people we used to know 
 They're an illusion to me now 
 Some are mathematicians 
 Some are carpenter's wives 
 Don't know how it all got started 
 I don't what they do with their lives 
 But me, I'm still on the road 
 Heading for another joint 
 We always did feel the same 
 We just saw it from a different point of view 
 Tangled up in blue"
157,Bob Dylan,rock,Simple Twist Of Fate,"They sat together in the park 
 As the evening sky grew dark 
 She looked at him and he felt a spark 
 Tingle to his bones 
 'Twas then he felt alone 
 And wished that he'd gone straight 
 And watched out for a simple twist of fate 
 They walked alone by the old canal 
 A little confused, I remember well 
 And stopped into a strange hotel 
 With a neon burning bright 
 He felt the heat of the night 
 Hit him like a freight- 
 Train moving with a simple twist of fate 
 A saxophone someplace far off played 
 As she was walking on by the arcade 
 As the light bust through a beat up shade 
 Where he was waking up 
 She dropped a coin into the cup 
 Of a blind man at the gate 
 And forgot about a simple twist of fate 
 He woke up; the room was bare 
 He didn't see her anywhere 
 He told himself he didn't care 
 Pushed the window open wide 
 Felt an emptiness inside 
 To which he just could not relate 
 Brought on by a simple twist of fate 
 He hears the ticking of the clocks 
 And walks along with a parrot that talks 
 Hunts her down by the waterfront docks 
 Where the sailors all come in 
 Maybe she'll pick him out again 
 How long must he wait 
 One more time for a simple twist of fate 
 People tell me it's a sin 
 To know and feel too much within 
 I still believe she was my twin 
 But I lost the ring 
 She was born in spring 
 But I was born too late 
 Blame it on a simple twist of fate"
158,Bob Dylan,rock,You're A Big Girl Now,"Our conversation was short and sweet 
 It nearly swept me offa my feet 
 And I'm back in the rain 
 Oh, and you are on dry land 
 You made it there somehow 
 You're a big girl now 
 Bird on the horizon, sitting on a fence 
 He's singing his song for me at his own expense 
 And I'm just like that bird 
 Oh, singing just for you 
 I hope that you can hear 
 Hear me singing through these tears 
 Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast 
 Oh but what a shame, that all we've shared can't last 
 I can change I swear 
 Oh, see what you can do 
 I can make it through 
 You can make it too 
 Love is so simple, to quote a phrase 
 You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days 
 Oh I know where I can find you 
 Oh, in somebody's room 
 It's a price I have to pay 
 You're a big girl all the way 
 A change in the weather is known to be extreme 
 But what's the sense in changing horses in midstream 
 I'm going out of my mind 
 Oh, with a pain that stops and starts 
 Like a corkscrew to my heart 
 Ever since we've been apart"
159,Bob Dylan,rock,Idiot Wind,"Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press 
 Whoever it is I wish they'd cut it out quick but when they will I can only guess 
 They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy 
 She inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me 
 I can't help it if I'm lucky 
 People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act 
 Their minds are filled with big ideas, images and distorted facts 
 Even you, yesterday you had to ask me where it was at 
 I couldn't believe after all these years, you didn't know me better than that 
 Sweet lady 
 Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your mouth 
 Blowing down the backroads headin' south 
 Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth 
 You're an idiot, babe 
 It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe 
 I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike 
 I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like 
 There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pourin' out of my boxcar door 
 You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war 
 After losin' every battle 
 I woke up on the roadside, daydreamin' 'bout the way things sometimes are 
 Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are makin' me see stars 
 You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies 
 One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzin' around your eyes 
 Blood on your saddle 
 Idiot wind, blowing through the flowers on your tomb 
 Blowing through the curtains in your room 
 Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth 
 You're an idiot, babe 
 It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe 
 It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart 
 You tamed the lion in my cage but it just wasn't enough to change my heart. 
 Now everything's a little upside down, as a matter of fact the wheels have stopped 
 What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top 
 You're on the bottom 
 I noticed at the ceremony, your corrupt ways had finally made you blind 
 I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes don't look into mine 
 The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned 
 I waited for you on the running boards, near the cypress trees, while the springtime turned 
 Slowly into autumn 
 Idiot wind, blowing like a circle around my skull 
 From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol 
 Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth 
 You're an idiot, babe 
 It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe 
 I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read 
 Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishin' I been somebody else instead 
 Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy 
 I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory 
 And all your ragin' glory 
 I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free 
 I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me 
 You'll never know the hurt I suffered nor the pain I rise above 
 And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness or your kind of love 
 And it makes me feel so sorry 
 Idiot wind, blowing through the buttons of our coats 
 Blowing through the letters that we wrote 
 Idiot wind, blowing through the dust upon our shelves 
 We're idiots, babe 
 It's a wonder we can even feed ourselves"
160,Bob Dylan,rock,You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go,"I've seen love go by my door 
 It's never been this close before 
 Never been so easy or so slow 
 I been shootin' in the dark too long 
 When something's not right it's wrong 
 You're gonna make me lonesome when you go 
 Dragon clouds so high above 
 I've only known careless love 
 It always has hit me from below 
 But this time 'round it's more correct 
 Right on target so direct 
 You're gonna make me lonesome when you go 
 Purple clover, Queen Anne lace 
 Crimson hair across your face 
 You can make me cry but you don't know 
 Can't remember what I was thinking of 
 You might be spoiling me too much love 
 You're gonna make me lonesome when you go 
 Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy 
 Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme 
 Blue river running slow and lazy 
 I could stay with you forever and never realize the time 
 Situations have ended sad 
 Relationships have all been bad 
 Mine have been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's 
 But there's no way I can compare 
 All them scenes to this affair, 
 You're gonna make me lonesome when you go 
 You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing 
 Staying far behind without you 
 You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying 
 You're gonna make me give myself a good talking to 
 I'll look for you in old Honolulu 
 San Francisco or Ashtabula 
 You're gonna have to leave me now I know 
 But I'll see you in the sky above 
 In the tall grass in the ones I love 
 You're gonna make me lonesome when you go"
161,Bob Dylan,rock,Meet Me In The Morning,"Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha 
 Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha 
 Honey, we could be in Kansas 
 By time the snow begins to thaw. 
 They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn 
 They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn 
 Honey you wouldn't know it by me 
 Every day's been darkness since you been gone. 
 Little rooster crowin', there must be something on his mind 
 Little rooster crowin', there must be something on his mind 
 Well, I feel just like that rooster 
 Honey, ya treat me so unkind. 
 Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above 
 Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above 
 Well, you know I even outrun the hound dogs 
 Honey, you know I've earned your love. 
 Look at the sun sinkin' like a ship 
 Look at the sun sinkin' like a ship 
 Ain't that just like my heart, babe 
 When you kissed my lips?"
162,Bob Dylan,rock,"Lily, Rosemary And The Jack Of Hearts","The festival was over, the boys were all plannin' for a fall 
 The cabaret was quiet except for the drillin' in the wall 
 The curfew had been lifted and the gamblin' wheel shut down 
 Anyone who had any sense had already left town 
 He was standin' in the doorway lookin' like the Jack of Hearts 
 He moved across the mirrored room, ""Set it up for everyone,"" he said 
 Then everyone commenced to do what they were doin' before he turned their heads 
 Then he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin 
 ""Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"" 
 Then he moved into the corner, face down like the Jack of Hearts 
 Backstage the girls were playin' five-card stud by the stairs 
 Lily had two queens, she was hopin' for a third to match her pair 
 Outside the streets were fillin' up, the window was open wide 
 A gentle breeze was blowin', you could feel it from inside 
 Lily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts 
 Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine 
 He made his usual entrance lookin' so dandy and so fine 
 With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place 
 He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste 
 But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the Jack of Hearts 
 Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town 
 She slipped in through the side door lookin' like a queen without a crown 
 She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear 
 ""Sorry, darlin', that I'm late,"" but he didn't seem to hear 
 He was starin' into space over at the Jack of Hearts 
 ""I know I've seen that face somewhere,"" Big Jim was thinkin' to himself 
 ""Maybe down in Mexico or a picture up on somebody's shelf"" 
 But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights did dim 
 And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him 
 Starin' at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts 
 Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child 
 She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled 
 She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs 
 With men in every walk of life which took her everywhere 
 But she'd never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts 
 The hangin' judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined 
 The drillin' in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind 
 It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring 
 And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king 
 No, nothin' ever would except maybe the Jack of Hearts 
 Rosemary started drinkin' hard and seein' her reflection in the knife 
 She was tired of the attention, tired of playin' the role of Big Jim's wife 
 She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide 
 Was lookin' to do just one good deed before she died 
 She was gazin' to the future, riding on the Jack of Hearts 
 Lily took her dress off and buried it away 
 ""Has your luck run out?"" she laughed at him, ""Well, I guess you must 
 Have known it would someday 
 Be careful not to touch the wall, there's a brand-new coat of paint 
 I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're lookin' like a saint"" 
 Down the hallway footsteps were comin' for the Jack of Hearts 
 The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair 
 ""There's something funny going on,"" he said, ""I can just feel it in the air"" 
 He went to get the hangin' judge, but the hangin' judge was drunk 
 As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk 
 There was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts 
 No one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick 
 The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked 
 And Big Jim was standin' there, ya couldn't say surprised 
 Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes 
 She was with Big Jim but she was leanin' to the Jack of Hearts 
 Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall 
 And cleaned out the bank safe, it's said they got off with quite a haul 
 In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground 
 For one more member who had business back in town 
 But they couldn't go no further without the Jack of Hearts 
 The next day was hangin' day, the sky was overcast and black 
 Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back 
 And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink 
 The hangin' judge was sober, he hadn't had a drink 
 The only person on the scene missin' was the Jack of Hearts 
 The cabaret was empty now, a sign said, ""Closed for repair"" 
 Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair 
 She was thinkin' 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw 
 Thinkin' 'bout Rosemary and thinkin' about the law 
 But, most of all she was thinkin' 'bout the Jack of Hearts"
163,Bob Dylan,rock,If You See Her Say Hello,"If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier 
 She left here last early spring, is livin' there, I hear 
 Say for me that I'm all right though things get kind of slow 
 She might think that I've forgotten her, don't tell her it isn't so. 
 We had a falling-out, like lovers often will 
 And to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill 
 And though our separation, it pierced me to the heart 
 She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart. 
 If you get close to her, kiss her once for me 
 I always have respected her for doing what she did and gettin' free 
 Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way 
 Though the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay. 
 I see a lot of people as I make the rounds 
 And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town 
 And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off 
 Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm gettin' soft. 
 Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past 
 I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast 
 If she's passin' back this way, I'm not that hard to find 
 Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time."
164,Bob Dylan,rock,Shelter From The Storm,"'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood 
 When blackness was a virtue the road was full of mud 
 I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form 
 ""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm"" 
 And if I pass this way again, you can rest assured 
 I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word 
 In a world of steel-eyed death, and men who are fighting to be warm. 
 ""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm"" 
 Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved 
 Everything up to that point had been left unresolved 
 Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm 
 ""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm"" 
 I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail 
 Poisoned in the bushes an' blown out on the trail 
 Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn 
 ""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm"" 
 Suddenly I turned around and she was standin' there 
 With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair 
 She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns 
 ""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm"" 
 Now there's a wall between us, somethin' there's been lost 
 I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed 
 Just to think that it all began on an noneventful morn 
 ""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm"" 
 Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount 
 But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts 
 And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn 
 ""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm"" 
 I've heard newborn babies wailin' like a mournin' dove 
 And old men with broken teeth stranded without love 
 Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn? 
 ""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm"" 
 In a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes 
 I bargained for salvation an' she gave me a lethal dose 
 I offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn 
 ""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm"" 
 Well, I'm livin' in a foreign country but I'm bound to cross the line 
 Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine 
 If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born 
 ""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm"""
165,Bob Dylan,rock,Buckets Of Rain,"Buckets of rain 
 Buckets of tears 
 Got all them buckets comin' out of my ears. 
 Buckets of moonbeams in my hand, 
 You got all the love, honey baby, 
 I can stand. 
 I been meek 
 And hard like an oak 
 I seen pretty people disappear like smoke. 
 Friends will arrive, friends will disappear, 
 If you want me, honey baby, 
 I'll be here. 
 I like your smile 
 And your fingertips 
 I like the way that you move your hips. 
 I like the cool way you look at me, 
 Everything about you is bringing me 
 Misery. 
 Little red wagon 
 Little red bike 
 I ain't no monkey but I know what I like. 
 I like the way you love me strong and slow, 
 I'm takin' you with me, honey baby, 
 When I go. 
 Life is sad 
 Life is a bust 
 All ya can do is do what you must. 
 You do what you must do and ya do it well, 
 I do it for you, honey baby, 
 Can't you tell?"
166,Bob Dylan,rock,Odds And Ends,"I stand in awe and I shake my face 
 You break your promise all over the place 
 You promised to love me, but what do I see 
 Just you comin' and spillin' juice over me 
 Odds and ends, odds and ends 
 Lost time is not found again 
 Now, you take your file and you bend my head 
 I never can remember anything that you've said 
 You promised to love me, but what do I know 
 You're always spillin' juice on me like you got someplace to go 
 Odds and ends, odds and ends 
 Lost time is not found again 
 Now, I've had enough, my box is clean 
 You know what I'm sayin' and you know what I mean 
 From now on you'd best get on someone else 
 While you're doin' it, keep that juice to yourself 
 Odds and ends, odds and ends 
 Lost time is not found again"
167,Bob Dylan,rock,Orange Juice Blues (Blues For Breakfast),"I had a hard time waking this morning 
 I got a lot of things on my mind 
 Like those friends of yours, they keep bringing me down 
 Just hangin' around all the time 
 I've had a hard time waking most mornings 
 And it's been that way for a month or more 
 You've had things your way but now I've got to say 
 I'm on my way out the door 
 Why don't you get right, try to get right, baby 
 You haven't been right with me, why don't you get right? 
 Try and get right, baby 
 Don't you remember how it used to be? 
 You had a hard time waking this morning 
 And I can see it in your empty eyes 
 But there's no need for talking or walking around the block 
 Just to figure out the reason why 
 I have a hard time handing out warnings 
 I'll just slide on out the door 
 'Cause I'm tired of everything being beautiful, beautiful 
 And I ain't coming back no more 
 Why can't you get right, try to get right, baby 
 You haven't been right with me, why don't you get right? 
 Try and get right, baby 
 Don't you remember how it used to be?"
168,Bob Dylan,rock,Million Dollar Bash,"Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged 
 Turtle, that friend of hers with his cheques all forged 
 And his cheeks in a chunk with his cheese in the cash 
 They all wanna be there at that million dollar bash 
 Ooh, baby, ooh-ee 
 Ooh, baby, ooh-ee 
 It's that million dollar bash 
 Everybody from right now to over there and back

 Come now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash 
 We're all gonna meet at that million dollar bash 
 Ooh, baby, ooh-ee 
 Ooh, baby, ooh-ee 
 It's that million dollar bash 
 Well, I took my counselor out to the barn 
 Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn 
 Then along came Jones, emptied the trash 
 Everybody went down to that million dollar bash 
 Ooh, baby, ooh-ee 
 Ooh, baby, ooh-ee 
 It's that million dollar bash 
 Well, I'm hittin' it too hard, my stones won't take 
 I get up in the mornin' but it's too early to wake 
 First it's hello, goodbye, then push and then crash 
 But we're all gonna make it at that million dollar bash 
 Ooh, baby, ooh-ee 
 Ooh, baby, ooh-ee 
 It's that million dollar bash 
 Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist 
 I punched myself in the face with my fist 
 I took my potatoes down to be mashed 
 And I made it on over to that million dollar bash 
 Ooh, baby, ooh-ee 
 Ooh, baby, ooh-ee 
 It's that million dollar bash"
169,Bob Dylan,rock,Yazoo Street Scandal,"Stranded out in the night, 
 Eliza took me down 
 To see the widow give 
 Rain to the town. 
 It's against the law 
 To be a tonic man 
 But the widow knows 
 She's got the upper hand. 
 So I went on in 
 Feelin' kinda wheezy. 
 You know she soothed my mind, boys, 
 She rocked me kinda slow and easy 
 All day and all night. 
 Pick a card before you go 
 It's a long trip to Mexico. 
 Eliza wait by the door, 
 I can't stay here anymore, no, no. 
 Then she took a pill 
 She washed her feet in the mud 
 She said ""look out son, you know, 
 I just ordered a flood 
 For forty days and forty nights"". 
 Then I dropped my shoes, 
 Eliza called my name. 
 She said it looked to her 
 Like it's gonna rain. 
 Then the cotton king 
 Came in chokin' 
 And the widow laughed and said, 
 ""I ain't jokin'."" 
 ""Take once for all"" 
 She said, ""Now don't ya tease me. 
 I just fell in love, boy, 
 So rock me kinda slow and kinda easy, 
 All day and all night."" 
 Sweet william said 
 With a drunken head, 
 ""If I had a boat, 
 I'd help y'all float"". 
 Eliza stood there watching, 
 William in a trance, 
 As the widow did 
 The St. vitus dance. 
 But just then an old man 
 With a boat named ""Breezy"" 
 Said, ""You can ride with Clyde, boys, 
 If you rock it kinda slow and easy, 
 All day and all night""."
170,Bob Dylan,rock,Goin' To Acapulco,"I'm goin' down to Rosemary's 
 She never does me wrong 
 She puts it to me plain as day 
 And gives it to me for a song. 
 It's a wicked life but what the hell 
 Everybody's got to eat 
 And I'm just the same as anyone else 
 When it comes to scratchin' for my meat. 
 Goin' to Acapulco 
 Goin' on the run 
 Goin' down to see soccer 
 Goin' to have some fun 
 Yeah! Goin' to have some fun. 
 Now whenever I am gettin' up 
 And can't find what I need 
 I just make it down to Rosemary's 
 And get somethin' quick to eat. 
 It's not a bad way to make a livin' 
 And I ain't complainin' none 
 For I can plow my plum and drink my rum 
 And then go on home and have my fun. 
 Goin' to Acapulco 
 Goin' on the run 
 Goin' down to see soccer 
 Goin' to have some fun 
 Yeah! Goin' to have some fun. 
 Now when someone offers me a joke 
 I just say, ""No thanks."" 
 I try to tell them like it is 
 And keep away from pranks. 
 Like every time you know when the well breaks down 
 I just go pump on it some 
 Rosemary, she likes to go to big places 
 And just sit there waitin' for me to come. 
 Goin' to Acapulco 
 Goin' on the run 
 Goin' down to see soccer 
 Gonna have some fun 
 Yeah! Goin' to have some fun."
171,Bob Dylan,rock,Katie's Been Gone,"Katie's been gone since the spring time. 
 She wrote one time and sent her love. 
 Katie's been gone for such a long time now. 
 I wonder what kind of love she's thinkin' of. 
 Dear Katie, if you can hear me, 
 I can't wait to have you near me. 
 Dear Katie, since you caught that bus, 
 Well, I don't know how things are with us. 
 I'm still here and you're out there. 
 Katie laughed when I said I was lonely. 
 She said, there's no need to feel that way. 
 Katie said that I was her only one 
 But then I wonder why she didn't wanna stay. 
 Dear Katie, if I am the only one, 
 How much longer will you be gone? 
 Oh, Katie, won't you tell me straight: 
 How much longer do I have to wait? 
 I believe you but please come through. 
 I know it's wrong to be apart this long. 
 You should be here, near me. 
 Katie's been gone and 
 Now her face is slowly fading from my mind. 
 She's gone to find some newer places, 
 Left the old life far behind. 
 Dear Katie, don't you miss your home? 
 I don't see why you had to roam. 
 Dear Katie, since you've been away 
 I lose a little something every day. 
 I need you here, but you're still out there. 
 Dear Katie, please drop me a line, 
 Just write, love, tell me you're fine. 
 Oh, Katie, if you can hear me, 
 I just can't wait to have you near me. 
 I can only think where are you, what you do, 
 May be there's someone new."
172,Bob Dylan,rock,Lo And Behold!,"I pulled out for San Antone, 
 I never felt so good. 
 My woman said she'd meet me there 
 And of course, I knew she would. 
 The coachman, he hit me for my hook 
 And he asked me my name. 
 I gave it to him right away, 
 Then I hung my head in shame. 
 Lo and behold! Lo and behold! 
 Lookin' for my lo and behold, 
 Get me out of here, my dear man! 
 I come into Pittsburgh 
 At six-thirty flat. 
 I found myself a vacant seat 
 And I put down my hat. 
 ""What's the matter, Molly dear, 
 What's the matter with your mound?"" 
 ""What's it to you, Moby Dick? 
 This is chicken town!"" 
 Lo and behold! Lo and behold! 
 Lookin' for my lo and behold, 
 Get me out of here, my dear man! 
 I bought myself a herd of moose, 
 One she could call her own. 
 Well, she came out the very next day 
 To see where they had flown. 
 I'm goin' down to Tennessee, 
 Get me a truck or somethin'. 
 Gonna save my money and rip it up! 
 Lo and behold! Lo and behold! 
 Lookin' for my lo and behold, 
 Get me out of here, my dear man! 
 Now, I come in on a ferris wheel 
 And boys, I sure was slick. 
 I come in like a ton of bricks, 
 Laid a few tricks on 'em.

 When I get there, I'm wonderin' what she'll do 
 Now, in my day, I've made some foolish moves 
 But back then, I didn't worry about a thing 
 Now and again, I still wonder to myself 
 Was it her sweet love or the way that she could sing? 
 So I'm goin' down the road to see Bessie 
 Ooh, see her soon

174,Bob Dylan,rock,Clothes Line Saga,"After a while we took in the clothes 
 Nobody said very much 
 Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants 
 Which nobody really wanted to touch 
 Mama come in and picked up a book 
 An' Papa asked her what it was 
 Someone else asked, ""What do you care?"" 
 Papa said, ""Well, just because.."" 
 Then they started to take back their clothes 
 Hang'em on the line 
 It was January the thirtieth 
 And everybody was feelin' fine. 
 The next day, everybody got up 
 Seein' if the clothes were dry 
 The dogs were barking, a neighbor passed 
 Mama, of course, she said, ""Hi."" 
 ""Have you heard the news?"" he said with a grin 
 ""The Vice President's gone mad!"" 
 ""Where?"" ""Downtown."" ""When?"" ""Last night."" 
 ""Hmm, say, that's too bad."" 
 ""Well, there's nothing we can do about it,"" said the neighbor 
 ""It's just something we're gonna have to forget."" 
 ""Yes, I guess so."" said Ma 
 Then she asked me if the clothes were still wet. 
 I reached up, touched my shirt 
 And the neighbor said, ""Are those clothes yours?"" 
 I said, ""Some of them, not all of them."" 
 He said, ""You always help out around here with the chores?"" 
 I said, ""Sometime, not all the time."" 
 And my neighbor, he blew his nose 
 Just as papa yelled outside 
 ""Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes."" 
 Well, I just do what I'm told so I did it, of course 
 I went back in the house and Mama met me 
 And then I shut all the doors."

177,Bob Dylan,rock,Tears Of Rage,"We carried you in our arms 
 On Independence Day 
 And now you throw us all aside 
 And put us on our way. 
 Oh, what dear daughter would 'neath the sun 
 Would treat a father so? 
 To wait upon him hand and foot 
 Yet always answer, ""No""? 
 Tears of rage, tears of grief 
 Why am I always the one who must be the thief? 
 Come to me now, you know, we're so alone 
 And life is brief. 
 It was all pointed out the way to go 
 And scratched your name in sand, 
 Though you just thought that it was nothing more 
 Than a place for you to stand. 
 Now, I want you to know that while you watched, 
 You discovered there was no one true. 
 That I myself really thought 
 It was just a childish thing to do. 
 Tears of rage, tears of grief 
 Why am I always the one who must be the thief? 
 Come to me now, you know, we're so alone 
 And life is brief. 
 It was all very, very painless 
 When you ran out to receive 
 All that false instruction 
 Which we never could believe. 
 And now the heart is filled with gold 
 As if it was a purse. 
 But, oh, what kind of love is this 
 Which goes from bad to worse? 
 Tears of rage, tears of grief 
 Why am I always the one who must be the thief? 
 Come to me now, you know, we're so alone 
 And life is brief."
178,Bob Dylan,rock,Too Much Of Nothing,"Too much of nothing 
 Can make a man feel ill at ease 
 One man's temper rises 
 While another man's temper might freeze 
 Now it's a day of confession 
 And we cannot mock a soul 
 Oh, when there's too much of nothing 
 No one has control 
 Say hello to Valerie 
 Say hello to Vivian 
 Give her all my salary 
 On the waters of oblivion 
 Well, yes, too much of nothing 
 Can cause a man to weep 
 He can walk the streets like most and boast of 
 What he'd like to keep 
 But it's all been done before 
 It's all been written in the book 
 And when there's too much of nothing 
 Nobody should look 
 Say hello to Valerie 
 Say hello to Vivian 
 Give her all my salary 
 On the waters of oblivion 
 Now, too much of nothing 
 Can make a man a liar 
 It can cause some men to sleep on nails 
 It can cause others to eat fire 
 Everybody's doin' somethin' 
 I've heard it in a dream 
 But when there's too much of nothing 
 It just makes a fella mean 
 Say hello to Valerie 
 Say hello to Vivian 
 Give her all my salary 
 On the waters of oblivion"

 Sometimes I wonder how ya knew

 Ruben remus ain't no doctor 
 I knew the man and tried to remember 
 Just where it was that I'd seen his face. 
 Long ago, in a movie show, 
 He was like that man singin' bass. 
 Knew him by his nurs'ry rhyme: 
 The story of the rabbit man. 
 Fell right in and said to him: 
 ""I'd like to help you if I can."" 
 I know the film would only shock ya, 
 Ruben remus ain't no doctor! 
 He only needed what you had, 
 Asked for nothing more, 
 Said he'd like to take you on, 
 But it's been done before. 
 You couldn't see he's a travelin' man 
 And he cannot take your hand. 
 It's very hard to understand 
 Why his songs were never banned. 
 Guess the man would never knock ya, 
 Ruben remus ain't no doctor! 
 No one seen ya since he's been gone, 
 It's been a day, maybe more. 
 I took a walk in your yard 
 And knocked on your back door.

 I'm not the man who did ya in.

 Apple's got your fly. 
 I went down to the river on a Saturday morn, 
 A-lookin' around just to see who's born. 
 I found a little chicken down on his knees, 
 I went up and yelled to him, 
 ""Please, please, please!"" 
 He said, ""Don't ya tell Henry, 
 Don't ya tell Henry, 
 Don't ya tell Henry,

 I went down to the corner at a-half past ten, 
 I's lookin' around, I wouldn't say when. 
 I looked down low, I looked above, 
 And who did I see but the one I love. 
 She said, ""Don't ya tell Henry, 
 Don't ya tell Henry, 
 Don't ya tell Henry,

 Now, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve, 
 A-lookin' around just to see myself. 
 I spotted a horse and a donkey, too, 
 I looked for a cow and I saw me a few. 
 They said, ""Don't ya tell Henry, 
 Don't ya tell Henry, 
 Don't ya tell Henry,

 Now, I went down to the pumphouse the other night, 
 A-lookin' around, it was outa sight. 
 I looked high and low for that big ol' tree, 
 I did go upstairs but I didn't see nobody but me. 
 I said, ""Don't ya tell Henry,

186,Bob Dylan,rock,Nothing Was Delivered,"Nothing was delivered 
 And I tell this truth to you, 
 Not out of spite or anger 
 But simply because it's true. 
 Now, I hope you won't object to this, 
 Giving back all of what you owe, 
 The fewer words you have to waste on this, 
 The sooner you can go. 
 Nothing is better, nothing is best, 
 Take heed of this and get plenty of rest. 
 Nothing was delivered 
 But I can't say I sympathize 
 With what your fate is going to be, 
 Yes, for telling all those lies. 
 Now you must provide some answers 
 For what you sell has not been received, 
 And the sooner you come up with them, 
 The sooner you can leave. 
 Nothing is better, nothing is best, 
 Take heed of this and get plenty rest. 
 (Now you know) 
 Nothing was delivered 
 And it's up to you to say 
 Just what you had in mind 
 When you made ev'rybody pay. 
 No, nothing was delivered, 
 Yes, 'n' someone must explain 
 That as long as it takes to do this 
 Then that's how long that you'll remain. 
 Nothing is better, nothing is best, 
 Take heed of this and get plenty rest."

190,Bob Dylan,rock,Hurricane,"Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night 
 Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall. 
 She sees the bartender in a pool of blood, 
 Cries out, ""My God, they've killed them all!"" 
 Here comes the story of the Hurricane, 
 The man the authorities came to blame 
 For somethin' that he never done. 
 Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been 
 The champion of the world. 
 Three bodies lyin' there does Patty see 
 And another man named Bello, movin' around mysteriously. 
 ""I didn't do it,"" he says, and he throws up his hands 
 ""I was only robbin' the register, I hope you understand. 
 I saw them leavin',"" he says, and he stops 
 ""One of us had better call up the cops."" 
 And so Patty calls the cops 
 And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin' 
 In the hot New Jersey night. 
 Meanwhile, far away in another part of town 
 Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around. 
 Number one contender for the middleweight crown 
 Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down 
 When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road 
 Just like the time before and the time before that. 
 In Paterson that's just the way things go. 
 If you're black you might as well not show up on the street 
 'Less you wanna draw the heat. 
 Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops. 
 Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin' around 
 He said, ""I saw two men runnin' out, they looked like little apes 
 They jumped into a white car without-of-state plates."" 
 And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head. 
 Cop said, ""Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead"" 
 So they took him to the infirmary 
 And though this man could hardly see 
 He told 'em he could identify the guilty men. 
 Four in the mornin' and they haul Rubin in, 
 They took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs. 
 The wounded man looks up through his one dyin' eye 
 Says, ""Why'd you bring him in here for? He ain't the guy!"" 
 Yes, here's the story of the Hurricane, 
 The man the authorities came to blame 
 For somethin' that he never done. 
 Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been 
 The champion of the world. 
 Four months later, the ghettos are in flame, 
 Rubin's in South America, fightin' for his name 
 While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game 
 And the cops are puttin' the screws to him, lookin' for somebody to blame. 
 ""Remember that murder that happened in a bar? 
 Remember you said you saw the getaway car? 
 You think you'd like to play ball with the law? 
 Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw runnin' that night? 
 Don't forget that you are white."" 
 Arthur Dexter Bradley said, ""I'm really not sure."" 
 The cop said, ""A poor boy like you could use a break 
 We got you for the motel job and we're talkin' to your friend Bello 
 You don't wanta have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow. 
 You'll be doin' society a favor. 
 That sonofabitch is brave and gettin' braver. 
 We want to put his ass in stir 
 We want to pin this triple murder on him 
 He ain't no Gentleman Jim."" 
 Rubin could take a man out with just one punch 
 But he never did like to talk about it all that much. 
 ""It's my work,"" he'd say, ""I do it for pay 
 And when it's over I'd just as soon go on my way 
 Up to some paradise 
 Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice 
 And ride a horse along the trail."" 
 But then they took him to the jailhouse 
 Where they try to turn a man into a mouse. 
 All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance 
 The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance. 
 The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums 
 To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum 
 And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger. 
 No one doubted that he pulled the trigger. 
 And though they could not produce the gun, 
 The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed 
 And the all-white jury agreed. 
 Rubin Carter was falsely tried. 
 The crime was murder one, guess who testified? 
 Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied 
 And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride. 
 How can the life of such a man 
 Be in the palm of some fool's hand? 
 To see him obviously framed 
 Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land 
 Where justice is a game. 
 Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties 
 Are free to drink martinis and watch the sunrise 
 While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell 
 An innocent man in a living hell. 
 Yes, that's the story of the Hurricane, 
 But it won't be over till they clear his name 
 And give him back the time he's done. 
 Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been 
 The champion of the world."
191,Bob Dylan,rock,Isis,"I married Isis on the fifth day of May, 
 But I could not hold on to her very long. 
 So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away 
 For the wild unknown country where I could not go wrong. 
 I came to a high place of darkness and light. 
 The dividing line ran through the center of town. 
 I hitched up my pony to a post on the right, 
 Went in to the laundry to wash my clothes down. 
 A man in the corner approached me for a match. 
 I knew right away he was not ordinary. 
 He said, ""Are you lookin' for somethin' easy to catch?"" 
 I said, ""I got no money."" He said, ""That ain't necessary."" 
 We set out that night for the cold in the North. 
 I gave him my blanket, and he gave me his word. 
 I said, ""Where are we goin'?"" He said we'd be back by the fourth. 
 I said, ""That's the best news that I've ever heard."" 
 I was thinkin' about turquoise, I was thinkin' about gold, 
 I was thinkin' about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace. 
 As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold, 
 I was thinkin' about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless. 
 How she told me that one day we would meet up again, 
 And things would be different the next time we wed, 
 If I only could hang on and just be her friend. 
 I still can't remember all the best things she said. 
 We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice. 
 He said, ""There's a body I'm tryin' to find. 
 If I carry it out it'll bring a good price."" 
 'Twas-a then that I knew what he had on his mind. 
 The wind it was howlin' and the snow was outrageous. 
 We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn. 
 When he died I was hopin' that it wasn't contagious, 
 But I made up my mind that I had to go on. 
 I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty. 
 There was no jewels, no nothin', I felt I'd been had. 
 When I saw that my partner was just bein' friendly, 
 When I took up his offer I must-a been mad. 
 I picked up his body and I dragged him inside, 
 Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover. 
 I said a quick prayer then I felt satisfied. 
 Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her. 
 She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise. 
 Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed, 
 I came in from the East with the sun in my eyes. 
 I cursed her one time then I rode on ahead. 
 She said, ""Where ya been?"" I said, ""No place special."" 
 She said, ""You look different."" I said, ""Well, I guess."" 
 She said, ""You been gone."" I said, ""That's only natural."" 
 She said, ""You gonna stay?"" I said, ""If you want me to, yes."" 
 Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child. 
 What drives me to you is what drives me insane. 
 I still can remember the way that you smiled 
 On the fifth day of May in the drizzlin' rain."
192,Bob Dylan,rock,Mozambique,"I like to spend some time in Mozambique 
 The sunny sky is aqua blue 
 And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek. 
 It's very nice to stay a week or two 
 And maybe fall in love just me and you. 
 There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique 
 And plenty time for good romance 
 And everybody likes to stop and speak 
 To give the special one you seek a chance 
 And maybe say hello with just a glance. 
 Lying next to her by the ocean 
 Reaching out and touching her hand, 
 Whispering your secret emotion 
 Magic in a magical land. 
 And when it's time for leaving Mozambique, 
 To say goodbye to sand and sea, 
 You turn around to take a final peek 
 And you see why it's so unique to be 
 Among the lovely people living free 
 Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique."
193,Bob Dylan,rock,One More Cup Of Coffee (Valley Below),"Your breath is sweet 
 Your eyes are like two jewels in the sky. 
 Your back is straight, your hair is smooth 
 On the pillow where you lie. 
 But I don't sense affection 
 No gratitude or love 
 Your loyalty is not to me 
 But to the stars above. 
 One more cup of coffee for the road, 
 One more cup of coffee 'fore I go 
 To the valley below. 
 Your daddy he's an outlaw 
 And a wanderer by trade 
 He'll teach you how to pick and choose 
 And how to throw the blade. 
 He oversees his kingdom 
 So no stranger does intrude 
 His voice it trembles as he calls out 
 For another plate of food. 
 One more cup of coffee for the road, 
 One more cup of coffee 'fore I go 
 To the valley below. 
 Your sister sees the future 
 Like your mama and yourself. 
 You've never learned to read or write 
 There's no books upon your shelf. 
 And your pleasure knows no limits 
 Your voice is like a meadowlark 
 But your heart is like an ocean 
 Mysterious and dark. 
 One more cup of coffee for the road, 
 One more cup of coffee 'fore I go 
 To the valley below."
194,Bob Dylan,rock,"Oh, Sister","Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms 
 You should not treat me like a stranger. 
 Our Father would not like the way that you act 
 And you must realize the danger. 
 Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you 
 And one deserving of affection? 
 And is our purpose not the same on this earth, 
 To love and follow 
 His direction? 
 We grew up together 
 From the cradle to the grave 
 We died and were reborn 
 And then mysteriously saved. 
 Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door, 
 Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow. 
 Time is an ocean but it ends at the shore 
 You may not see me tomorrow."
195,Bob Dylan,rock,Joey,"Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when 
 Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion 
 Always on the outside of whatever side there was 
 When they asked him why it had to be that way, ""Well,"" he answered, ""just because."" 
 Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last. 
 They called Joe ""Crazy,"" the baby they called ""Kid Blast."" 
 Some say they lived off gambling and runnin' numbers too. 
 It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue. 
 Joey, Joey, 
 King of the streets, child of clay. 
 Joey, Joey, 
 What made them want to come and blow you away? 
 There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that 
 No one ever knew for sure where they were really at. 
 When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost hit the roof. 
 He went out that night to seek revenge, thinkin' he was bulletproof. 
 The war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets 
 Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats 
 Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners. 
 They stashed them away in a basement, called them amateurs. 
 The hostages were tremblin' when they heard a man exclaim, 
 ""Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."" 
 But Joey stepped up, he raised his hand, said, ""We're not those kind of men. 
 It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."" 
 Joey, Joey, 
 King of the streets, child of clay. 
 Joey, Joey, 
 What made them want to come and blow you away? 
 The police department hounded him, they called him Mr. Smith 
 They got him on conspiracy, they were never sure who with. 
 ""What time is it?"" said the judge to Joey when they met 
 ""Five to ten,"" said Joey. The judge says, ""That's exactly what you get."" 
 He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich 
 They threw him in the hole one time for tryin' to stop a strike. 
 His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand 
 What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand. 
 When they let him out in '71 he'd lost a little weight 
 But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great. 
 He tried to find the way back into the life he left behind 
 To the boss he said, ""I have returned and now I want what's mine."" 
 Joey, Joey, 
 King of the streets, child of clay. 
 Joey, Joey, 
 Why did they have to come and blow you away? 
 It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun 
 ""I'm around too many children,"" he'd say, ""they should never know of one."" 
 Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong deadly foe, 
 Emptied out the register, said, ""Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."" 
 One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York 
 He could see it comin' through the door as he lifted up his fork. 
 He pushed the table over to protect his family 
 Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy. 
 Joey, Joey, 
 King of the streets, child of clay. 
 Joey, Joey, 
 What made them want to come and blow you away? 
 Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep. 
 I heard his best friend Frankie say, ""He ain't dead, he's just asleep."" 
 Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave 
 I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save. 
 The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned 
 They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born. 
 And someday if God's in heaven overlookin' His preserve 
 I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve. 
 Joey, Joey, 
 King of the streets, child of clay. 
 Joey, Joey, 
 What made them want to come and blow you away?"
196,Bob Dylan,rock,Romance In Durango,"Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun 
 Dust on my face and my cape, 
 Me and Magdalena on the run 
 I think this time we shall escape. 
 Sold my guitar to the baker's son 
 For a few crumbs and a place to hide, 
 But I can get another one 
 And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride. 
 No llores, mi querida 
 Dios nos vigila 
 Soon the horse will take us to Durango. 
 Agarrame, mi vida 
 Soon the desert will be gone 
 Soon you will be dancing the fandango. 
 Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people 
 Hoofbeats like castanets on stone. 
 At night I dream of bells in the village steeple 
 Then I see the bloody face of Ramon. 
 Was it me that shot him down in the cantina 
 Was it my hand that held the gun? 
 Come, let us fly, my Magdalena 
 The dogs are barking and what's done is done. 
 No llores, mi querida 
 Dios nos vigila 
 Soon the horse will take us to Durango. 
 Agarrame, mi vida 
 Soon the desert will be gone 
 Soon you will be dancing the fandango. 
 At the corrida we'll sit in the shade 
 And watch the young torero stand alone. 
 We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed 
 When they rode with Villa into Torreon. 
 Then the padre will recite the prayers of old 
 In the little church this side of town. 
 I will wear new boots and an earring of gold 
 You'll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown. 
 The way is long but the end is near 
 Already the fiesta has begun. 
 The face of God will appear 
 With His serpent eyes of obsidian. 
 No llores, mi querida 
 Dios nos vigila 
 Soon the horse will take us to Durango. 
 Agarrame, mi vida 
 Soon the desert will be gone 
 Soon you will be dancing the fandango. 
 Was that the thunder that I heard? 
 My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain 
 Come sit by me, don't say a word 
 Oh, can it be that I am slain? 
 Quick, Magdalena, take my gun 
 Look up in the hills, that flash of light. 
 Aim well my little one 
 We may not make it through the night. 
 No llores, mi querida 
 Dios nos vigila 
 Soon the horse will take us to Durango. 
 Agarrame, mi vida 
 Soon the desert will be gone 
 Soon you will be dancing the fandango."
197,Bob Dylan,rock,Black Diamond Bay,"Up on the white veranda 
 She wears a necktie and her Panama hat. 
 Her passport shows a face 
 From another time and place 
 She looks nothin' like that. 
 And all the remnants of her recent past 
 Are scattered in the wild wind. 
 She walks across the marble floor 
 Where a voice from the gambling room is callin' her to come on in. 
 She smiles, walks the other way 
 As the last ship sails and the moon fades away 
 From Black Diamond Bay. 
 As the mornin' light breaks open, the Greek comes down 
 And he asks for a rope and a pen that will write. 
 ""Pardon, monsieur,"" the desk clerk says, 
 Carefully removes his fez, 
 ""Am I hearin' you right?"" 
 And as the yellow fog is liftin' 
 The Greek is quickly headin' for the second floor. 
 She passes him on the spiral staircase 
 Thinkin' he's the Soviet Ambassador, 
 She starts to speak, but he walks away 
 As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway 
 On Black Diamond Bay. 
 A soldier sits beneath the fan 
 Doin' business with a tiny man who sells him a ring. 
 Lightning strikes, the lights blow out. 
 The desk clerk wakes and begins to shout, 
 ""Can you see anything?"" 
 Then the Greek appears on the second floor 
 In his bare feet with a rope around his neck, 
 While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, 
 Says, ""Open up another deck."" 
 But the dealer says, ""Attendez-vous, s'il vous plait,"" 
 As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away 
 From Black Diamond Bay. 
 The desk clerk heard the woman laugh 
 As he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough. 
 He tried to grab the woman's hand, 
 Said, ""Here's a ring, it cost a grand."" 
 She said, ""That ain't enough."" 
 Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags 
 While a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb. 
 She passed the door that the Greek had locked, 
 Where a handwritten sign read, ""Do Not Disturb."" 
 She knocked upon it anyway 
 As the sun went down and the music did play 
 On Black Diamond Bay. 
 ""I've got to talk to someone quick!"" 
 But the Greek said, ""Go away,"" and he kicked the chair to the floor. 
 He hung there from the chandelier. 
 She cried, ""Help, there's danger near 
 Please open up the door!"" 
 Then the volcano erupted 
 And the lava flowed down from the mountain high above. 
 The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner 
 Thinking of forbidden love. 
 But the desk clerk said, ""It happens every day,"" 
 As the stars fell down and the fields burned away 
 On Black Diamond Bay. 
 As the island slowly sank 
 The loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room. 
 The dealer said, ""It's too late now. 
 You can take your money, but I don't know how 
 You'll spend it in the tomb."" 
 The tiny man bit the soldier's ear 
 As the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew, 
 While she's out on the balcony, where a stranger tells her, 
 ""My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."" 
 She sheds a tear and then begins to pray 
 As the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away 
 From Black Diamond Bay. 
 I was sittin' home alone one night in L.A., 
 Watchin' old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news. 
 It seems there was an earthquake that 
 Left nothin' but a Panama hat 
 And a pair of old Greek shoes. 
 Didn't seem like much was happenin', 
 So I turned it off and went to grab another beer. 
 Seems like every time you turn around 
 There's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear 
 And there's really nothin' anyone can say 
 And I never did plan to go anyway 
 To Black Diamond Bay."
198,Bob Dylan,rock,Sara,"I laid on a dune, I looked at the sky, 
 When the children were babies and played on the beach. 
 You came up behind me, I saw you go by, 
 You were always so close and still within reach. 
 Sara, Sara, 
 Whatever made you want to change your mind? 
 Sara, Sara, 
 So easy to look at, so hard to define. 
 I can still see them playin' with their pails in the sand, 
 They run to the water their buckets to fill. 
 I can still see the shells fallin' out of their hands 
 As they follow each other back up the hill. 
 Sara, Sara, 
 Sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life, 
 Sara, Sara, 
 Radiant jewel, a mystical wife. 
 Sleepin' in the woods by a fire in the night, 
 Drinkin' white rum in a Portugal bar, 
 Them playin' leapfrog and hearin' about Snow White, 
 You in the marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar. 
 Sara, Sara, 
 It's all so clear, I could never forget, 
 Sara, Sara, 
 Lovin' you is the one thing I'll never regret. 
 I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells, 
 I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through, 
 Stayin' up for days in the Chelsea Hotel, 
 Writin' ""Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands"" for you. 
 Sara, Sara, 
 Wherever we travel we're never apart. 
 Sara, oh Sara, 
 Beautiful lady, so dear to my heart. 
 How did I meet you? I don't know. 
 A messenger sent me in a tropical storm. 
 You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow 
 And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm. 
 Sara, oh Sara, 
 Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress, 
 Sara, Sara, 
 Ya must forgive me my unworthiness. 
 Now the beach is deserted except for some kelp 
 And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore. 
 You always responded when I needed your help, 
 You gave me a map and a key to your door. 
 Sara, oh Sara, 
 Glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow, 
 Sara, oh Sara, 
 Don't ever leave me, don't ever go."
199,Bob Dylan,rock,Changing Of The Guards,"Sixteen years 
 Sixteen banners united over the field 
 Where the good shepherd grieves 
 Desperate men, desperate women divided 
 Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves 
 Fortune calls 
 I stepped forth from the shadows, to the marketplace 
 Merchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down 
 She's smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born 
 On midsummer's eve, near the tower 
 The cold-blooded moon 
 The captain waits above the celebration 
 Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid 
 Whose ebony face is beyond communication 
 The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid 
 They shaved her head 
 She was torn between Jupiter and Apollo 
 A messenger arrived with a black nightingale 
 I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow 
 Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil 
 I stumbled to my feet 
 I rode past destruction in the ditches 
 With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo 
 Renegade priests and treacherous young witches 
 Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you 
 The palace of mirrors 
 Where dog soldiers are reflected 
 The endless road and the wailing of chimes 
 The empty rooms where her memory is protected 
 Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times 
 She wakes him up 
 Forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking 
 Near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks 
 She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking 
 He's pulling her down and she's clutching on to his long golden locks 
 Gentlemen, he said 
 I don't need your organization, I've shined your shoes 
 I've moved your mountains and marked your cards 
 But Eden is burning, either get ready for elimination 
 Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards 
 Peace will come 
 With tranquility and splendor on the wheels of fire 
 But will offer no reward when her false idols fall 
 And cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating 
 Between the King and the Queen of Swords"
200,Bob Dylan,rock,New Pony,"I had a pony, her name was Lucifer 
 I had a pony, her name was Lucifer 
 She broke her leg and needed shooting 
 I swear it hurt me more than it could have hurted her 
 Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X 
 Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X 
 She got such a sweet disposition 
 I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next 
 I got a new pony, she knows how to fox-trot, lope and pace 
 Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to fox-trot, lope and pace 
 She got great big hind legs 
 Long black shaggy hair hangin' in her face 
 Ev'rybody says you're usin' voodoo, I seen your feet walk by themselves 
 Oh well ev'rybody says you're usin' voodoo, I seen your feet walk by themselves 
 Oh, baby, but that god you been prayin' to 
 Gonna give ya back what you wishin' on someone else 
 Come over here pony, I, I wanna climb up one time on you 
 Oh well come over here pony, I, I wanna climb up one time on you 
 You know so nasty and your'e so bad 
 But I swear I love you, yes I do"
201,Bob Dylan,rock,No Time To Think,"In death, you face life with a child and a wife 
 Who sleep-walks through your dreams into walls 
 You're a soldier of mercy, and you're cold and you curse 
 ""He who cannot be trusted must fall"" 
 Loneliness, tenderness, high society, notoriety 
 You fight for the throne and you travel alone 
 Unknown as you slowly sink 
 And there's no time to think 
 In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity 
 In secret, for pieces of change 
 The empress attracts you but oppression distracts you 
 It makes you feel violent and strange 
 Memory, ecstasy, tyranny, hypocrisy 
 Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss 
 In the valley of the missing link 
 And there's no time to think 
 Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you 
 Her worst is better than best 
 I've seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes 
 And I feel so depressed 
 China doll, alcohol, duality, mortality 
 Mercury rules you and destiny fools you 
 Like the plague, with a dangerous wink 
 And there's no time to think 
 Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you 
 Where the lion lies down with the lamb 
 I'd have paid the traitor and killed him much later 
 But that's just the way that I am 
 Paradise, sacrifice, mortality, reality 
 But the magician is quicker and his game 
 Is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink 
 And there's no time to think 
 Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us 
 He's contented when you're under his thumb 
 Madmen oppose him, your kindness throws him 
 To survive it you play deaf and dumb 
 Equality, liberty, humility, simplicity 
 You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear 
 At the back of your head as you drink 
 And there's no time to think 
 Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow 
 Will offer their heads for a prayer 
 You can't find no salvation, have no expectations 
 Anytime, anyplace, anywhere 
 Mercury, gravity, nobility, humility 
 You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper 
 That is leading you onto the brink 
 And there's no time to think 
 You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity 
 For pleasure you must now resist 
 Lovers obey you but they cannot sway you 
 They're not even sure you exist 
 Socialism, hypnotism, patriotism, materialism 
 Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws 
 And the sound of the keys as they clink 
 And there's no time to think 
 The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl 
 With the rose in her hair 
 Starlight in the East you finally released 
 You're stranded with nothing to share 
 Loyalty, unity, epitome, rigidity 
 You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 
 'Neath the moon shinin' bloody and pink 
 And there's no time to think 
 Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you 
 But no, you will not be deceived 
 Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt 
 You can give but you cannot receive 
 No time to choose when the truth must die 
 No time to lose or say goodbye 
 No time to prepare for the victim that's there 
 No time to suffer or blink 
 And no time to think"
202,Bob Dylan,rock,"Baby, Stop Crying","You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe 
 But you're back where you belong 
 Go get me my pistol, babe 
 Honey, I can't tell right from wrong 
 Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying 
 Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying 
 Baby, please stop crying 
 You know, I know, the sun will always shine 
 But baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind 
 Go down to the river, babe 
 Honey, I will meet you there 
 Go down to the river, babe 
 Honey, I will pay your fare 
 Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying 
 Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying 
 Baby, please stop crying 
 You know, I know, the sun will always shine 
 But baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind 
 If you're looking for assistance, babe 
 Or if you just want some company 
 Or if you just want a friend you can talk to 
 Honey, come and see about me 
 Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying 
 Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying 
 Baby, please stop crying 
 You know, I know, the sun will always shine 
 But baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind 
 You been hurt so many times 
 And I know what you're thinking of 
 Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe 
 To see that you're madly in love 
 But baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying 
 Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying 
 Baby, please stop crying 
 You know, I know, the sun will always shine 
 But baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind"
203,Bob Dylan,rock,Is Your Love In Vain?,"Do you love me, or are you just extending goodwill? 
 Do you need me half as bad as you say, or are you just feeling guilt? 
 I've been burned before and I know the score 
 So you won't hear me complain 
 Will I be able to count on you 
 Or is your love in vain? 
 Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude? 
 When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude? 
 Do you know my world, do you know my kind 
 Or must I explain? 
 Will you let me be myself 
 Or is your love in vain? 
 Well I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind 
 I've been in and out of happiness 
 I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings 
 And I've never been too impressed 
 All right, I'll take a chance, I will fall in love with you 
 If I'm a fool you can have the night, you can have the morning too 
 Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow 
 Do you understand my pain? 
 Are you willing to risk it all 
 Or is your love in vain? 
 Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow 
 Do you understand my pain? 
 Are you willing to risk it all 
 Or is your love in vain?"
204,Bob Dylan,rock,Señor (Tales Of Yankee Power),"Senor, senor, can you tell me where we're headin'? 
 Lincoln County Road or Armageddon? 
 Seem like I been down this way before 
 Is there any truth in that, senor? 
 Senor, senor, do you know where she's hidin'? 
 How long are we gonna be ridin'? 
 How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door? 
 Will there be any comfort there, senor? 
 There's a wicked wind still blowin' on that upper deck 
 There's an iron cross still hanging down from around her neck 
 There's a marchin' band still playin' in that vacant lot 
 Where she held me in her arms one time and said, ""Forget me not"" 
 Senor, senor, I can see that painted wagon 
 I can smell the tail of the dragon 
 Can't stand the suspense anymore 
 Can you tell me who to contact here, senor? 
 Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled 
 Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field 
 A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring 
 She said, ""Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing"" 
 Senor, senor, you know their hearts they're as hard as leather 
 Well, give me a minute, let me get it together 
 I just gotta pick myself up off the floor 
 I'm ready when you are, senor 
 Senor, senor, let's overturn these tables 
 Disconnect these cables 
 This place don't make sense to me no more 
 Can you tell me what we're waiting for, senor?"
205,Bob Dylan,rock,True Love Tends To Forget,"I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes 
 When she's near me she's so hard to recognize 
 But I finally realize there's no room for regret 
 True love, true love, true love tends to forget 
 Hold me, baby be near 
 You told me that you'd be sincere 
 But every day of the year like playin' Russian roulette 
 True love, true love, true love tends to forget 
 I was lyin' down in the reeds without any oxygen 
 I saw you in the wilderness among the men 
 I saw you drift into infinity and come back again 
 All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when 
 You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell 
 You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well 
 And this weekend in hell is making me sweat 
 True love, true love, true love tends to forget 
 True love, true love, true love tends to forget 
 I was lyin' down in the reeds without any oxygen 
 I saw you in the wilderness among the men 
 Saw you drift into infinity and come back again 
 All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when 
 You belong to me, baby, without a doubt 
 Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out 
 Don't keep me knockin' about from Mexico to Tibet 
 True love, true love, true love tends to forget"
206,Bob Dylan,rock,We Better Talk This Over,"I think we better talk this over 
 Maybe when we both get sober 
 You'll understand I'm only a man 
 Doin' the best that I can 
 This situation can only get rougher 
 Why should we needlessly suffer? 
 Let's call it a day, go our own different ways 
 Before we decay 
 You don't have to be afraid of looking into my face 
 We've done nothing to each other time will not erase 
 I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling 
 You been two-faced, you been double-dealing 
 I took a chance, got caught in the trance 
 Of a downhill dance 
 Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me? 
 I'm exiled, you can't convert me 
 I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways 
 With both eyes glazed 
 You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone 
 Somewheres in this universe there's a place that you can call home 
 I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow 
 If I have to beg, steal or borrow 
 It'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half 
 Look at each other and laugh 
 But I don't think it's liable to happen 
 Like the sound of one hand clappin' 
 The vows that we kept are now broken and swept 
 'Neath the bed where we slept 
 Don't think of me and fantasize on what we never had 
 Be grateful for what we've shared together and be glad 
 Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope? 
 Eventually we'll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope 
 Oh, babe, time for a new transition 
 I wish I was a magician 
 I would wave a wand and tie back the bond 
 That we've both gone beyond"
207,Bob Dylan,rock,Where Are You Tonight?,"There's a long-distance train rolling through the rain 
 Tears on the letter I write 
 There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missin' her so much 
 But she's drifting like a satellite 
 There's a neon light ablaze in a green smoky haze 
 And laughter down on Elizabeth Street 
 There's a lonesome bell tone in that valley of stone 
 Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat 
 Her father would emphasize you got to be more than street-wise 
 But he practiced what he preached from the heart 
 A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me 
 The time and the place that we'd part 
 There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage 
 And a longtime golden-haired stripper onstage 
 And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page 
 Of a book that nobody can write 
 Oh, where are you tonight? 
 The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure 
 To live it you had to explode 
 In that last hour of need, we entirely agreed 
 Sacrifice was the code of the road 
 I left town at dawn, with Marcel and St. John 
 Strong men belittled by doubt 
 I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were 
 But she had some way of finding them out 
 He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same 
 She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf 
 She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair 
 And discovered her invisible self 
 There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped 
 There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped 
 As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape 
 Well I won't, but then maybe again, I might 
 Oh, if I could just find you tonight 
 I fought with my twin, that enemy within 
 Till both of us fell by the way 
 Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees 
 While the law looks the other way 
 Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes 
 The man you were lovin' could never get clean 
 It felt out of place, my foot in his face 
 But he shoulda stayed where his money was green 
 I bit into the root of forbidden fruit 
 With the juice running down my leg 
 Then I dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss 
 Who always was too proud to beg 
 There's a white diamond gloom on the dark side of this room 
 And a pathway that leads up to the stars 
 If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise 
 Just remind me to show you the scars 
 There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived 
 If I'm-a there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived 
 I can't believe it, I can't believe I'm alive 
 But without you it doesn't seem right 
 Oh, where are you tonight?"
208,Bob Dylan,rock,Gotta Serve Somebody,"You may be an ambassador 
 To England or France 
 You might like to gamble

209,Bob Dylan,rock,Precious Angel,"Precious angel, under the sun, 
 How was I to know you'd be the one 
 To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone 
 How weak was the foundation I was standing upon? 
 Now there's spiritual warfare and flesh and blood breaking down. 
 You either got faith or you got unbelief and there ain't no neutral ground. 
 The enemy is subtle, how be it we are so deceived 
 When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe? 
 Shine your light, shine your light on me 
 Shine your light, shine your light on me 
 Shine your light, shine your light on me 
 You know I just couldn't make it by myself. 
 I'm a little too blind to see. 
 My so-called friends have fallen under a spell. 
 They look me squarely in the eye and they say, All is well. 
 Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high 
 When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die? 
 Sister, lemme tell you about a vision I saw. 
 You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law. 
 You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him about Mohammed 
 In the same breath. 
 You never mentioned one time the Man who came and died a criminal's death. 
 Shine your light, shine your light on me 
 Shine your light, shine your light on me 
 Shine your light, shine your light on me 
 You know I just couldn't make it by myself. 
 I'm a little too blind to see. 
 Precious angel, you believe me when I say 
 What God has given to us no man can take away. 
 We are covered in blood, girl, you know our forefathers were slaves. 
 Let us hope they've found mercy in their bone-filled graves. 
 You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight, 
 You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night. 
 But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed 
 On the way out of Egypt, through Ethiopia, to the judgment hall of Christ. 
 Shine your light, shine your light on me 
 Shine your light, shine your light on me 
 Shine your light, shine your light on me 
 You know I just couldn't make it by myself. 
 I'm a little too blind to see."
210,Bob Dylan,rock,I Believe In You,"They ask me how I feel 
 And if my love is real 
 And how I know I'll make it through 
 And they, they look at me and frown 
 They'd like to drive me from this town 
 They don't want me around 
 'Cause I believe in you 
 They show me to the door 
 They say don't come back no more 
 'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to 
 And I walk out on my own 
 A thousand miles from home 
 But I don't feel alone 
 'Cause I believe in you 
 I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter 
 I believe in you even though we be apart 
 I believe in you even on the morning after 
 Oh, when the dawn is nearing 
 Oh, when the night is disappearing 
 Oh, this feeling is still here in my heart 
 Don't let me drift too far 
 Keep me where you are 
 Where I will always be renewed 
 And that which you've given me today 
 Is worth more than I could pay 
 And no matter what they say 
 I believe in you 
 I believe in you when winter turn to summer 
 I believe in you when white turn to black 
 I believe in you even though I be outnumbered 
 Oh, though the earth may shake me 
 Oh, though my friends forsake me 
 Oh, even that couldn't make me go back 
 Don't let me change my heart 
 Keep me set apart 
 From all the plans they do pursue 
 And I, I don't mind the pain 
 Don't mind the driving rain 
 I know I will sustain 
 'Cause I believe in you"
211,Bob Dylan,rock,Slow Train,"Sometimes I feel so low-down and disgusted 
 Can't help but wonder what's happenin' to my companions, 
 Are they lost or are they found, have they counted the cost it'll take to bring 
 Down 
 All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon? 
 There's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend. 
 I had a woman down in Alabama, 
 She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic, 
 She said, ""Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out, 
 You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."" 
 There's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend. 
 All that foreign oil controlling American soil, 
 Look around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassed. 
 Sheiks walkin' around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose rings, 
 Deciding America's future from Amsterdam and to Paris 
 And there's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend. 
 Man's ego is inflated, his laws are outdated, they don't apply no more, 
 You can't rely no more to be standin' around waitin' 
 In the home of the brave, Jefferson turnin' over in his grave, 
 Fools glorifying themselves, trying to manipulate Satan 
 And there's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend. 
 Big-time negotiators, false healers and woman haters, 
 Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition 
 But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency, 
 All non-believers and men stealers talkin' in the name of religion 
 And there's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend. 
 People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting 
 Oh, you know it costs more to store the food than it do to give it. 
 They say lose your inhibitions, follow your own ambitions, 
 They talk about a life of brotherly love, show me someone who knows how to 
 Live it. There's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend. 
 Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talkin' boy she could destroy 
 A real suicide case, but there was nothin' I could do to stop it, 
 I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy 
 But it sure do bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets, 
 There's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend."
212,Bob Dylan,rock,Gonna Change My Way Of Thinking,"Gonna change my way of thinking, 
 Make myself a different set of rules. 
 Gonna change my way of thinking, 
 Make myself a different set of rules. 
 Gonna put my good foot forward, 
 And stop being influenced by fools. 
 So much oppression, 
 Can't keep track of it no more. 
 So much oppression, 
 Can't keep track of it no more. 
 Sons becoming husbands to their mothers, 
 And old men turning young daughters into whores. 
 Stripes on your shoulders, 
 Stripes on your back and on your hands. 
 Stripes on your shoulders, 
 Stripes on your back and on your hands. 
 Swords piercing your side, 
 Blood and water flowing through the land. 
 Well don't know which one is worse, 
 Doing your own thing or just being cool. 
 Well don't know which one is worse, 
 Doing your own thing or just being cool. 
 You remember only about the brass ring, 
 You forget all about the golden rule. 
 You can mislead a man, 
 You can take ahold of his heart with your eyes. 
 You can mislead a man, 
 You can take ahold of his heart with your eyes. 
 But there's only one authority, 
 And that's the authority on high. 
 I got a God-fearing woman, 
 One I can easily afford. 
 I got a God-fearing woman, 
 One I can easily afford. 
 She can do the Georgia crawl, 
 She can walk in the spirit of the Lord. 
 Jesus said, ""Be ready, 
 For you know not the hour in which I come."" 
 Jesus said, ""Be ready, 
 For you know not the hour in which I come."" 
 He said, ""He who is not for Me is against Me,"" 
 Just so you know where He's coming from. 
 There's a kingdom called Heaven, 
 A place where there is no pain of birth. 
 There's a kingdom called Heaven, 
 A place where there is no pain of birth. 
 Well the Lord created it, mister, 
 About the same time He made the earth."

 But if you do right to me, baby, 
 I'll do right to you, too. 
 Ya got to do unto others 
 Like you'd have them, like you'd have them, do unto you. 
 Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,

 Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married.

 Ya got to do unto others 
 Like you'd have them, like you'd have them, do unto you. 
 Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,

214,Bob Dylan,rock,When You Gonna Wake Up?,"God don't make no promises that He don't keep. 
 You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep. 
 When you gonna wake up, 
 When you gonna wake up 
 When you gonna wake up 
 And strengthen the things that remain? 
 Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts. 
 Karl Marx has got ya by the throat, and Henry Kissinger's got you tied up in knots. 
 When you gonna wake up, 
 When you gonna wake up 
 When you gonna wake up 
 And strengthen the things that remain? 
 You got innocent men in jail, 
 Your insane asylums are filled, 
 You got unrighteous doctors 
 Dealing drugs that'll never cure your ills. 
 When you gonna wake up, 
 When you gonna wake up 
 When you gonna wake up 
 And strengthen the things that remain? 
 You got men who can't hold their peace and women who can't control their tongues, 
 The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young. 
 When you gonna wake up, 
 When you gonna wake up 
 When you gonna wake up 
 And strengthen the things that remain? 
 Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools, 
 You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules. 
 When you gonna wake up, 
 When you gonna wake up 
 When you gonna wake up 
 And strengthen the things that remain? 
 Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move, 
 Instant inner peace and every step you take has got to be approved. 
 When you gonna wake up, 
 Said when you gonna wake up 
 When you gonna wake up 
 And strengthen the things that remain? 
 Do you ever wonder just what God requires? 
 You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires. 
 When you gonna wake up, 
 When you gonna wake up 
 When you gonna wake up 
 And strengthen the things that remain? 
 You can't take it with you and you know that it's too worthless to be sold, 
 They tell you, ""Time is money"" as if your life was worth its weight in gold. 
 There's a Man up on a cross and He's been crucified for you. 
 Believe in His power that's about all you got to do. 
 When you gonna wake up, 
 When you gonna wake up 
 When you gonna wake up 
 And strengthen the things that remain?"
215,Bob Dylan,rock,Man Gave Names To All The Animals,"Man gave names to all the animals 
 In the beginning, in the beginning. 
 Man gave names to all the animals 
 In the beginning, long time ago. 
 He saw an animal that liked to growl, 
 Big furry paws and he liked to howl, 
 Great big furry back and furry hair. 
 ""Ah, think I'll call it a bear."" 
 Man gave names to all the animals 
 In the beginning, in the beginning. 
 Man gave names to all the animals 
 In the beginning, long time ago. 
 He saw an animal up on a hill 
 Chewing up so much grass until she was filled. 
 He saw milk comin' out but he didn't know how. 
 ""Ah, think I'll call it a cow."" 
 Man gave names to all the animals 
 In the beginning, in the beginning. 
 Man gave names to all the animals 
 In the beginning, long time ago. 
 He saw an animal that liked to snort, 
 Horns on his head and they weren't too short. 
 It looked like there wasn't nothin' that he couldn't pull. 
 ""Ah, think I'll call it a bull."" 
 Man gave names to all the animals 
 In the beginning, in the beginning. 
 Man gave names to all the animals 
 In the beginning, long time ago. 
 He saw an animal leavin' a muddy trail, 
 Real dirty face and a curly tail. 
 He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big. 
 ""Ah, think I'll call it a pig."" 
 Man gave names to all the animals 
 In the beginning, in the beginning. 
 Man gave names to all the animals 
 In the beginning, long time ago. 
 Next animal that he did meet 
 Had wool on his back and hooves on his feet, 
 Eating grass on a mountainside so steep. 
 ""Ah, think I'll call it a sheep."" 
 Man gave names to all the animals 
 In the beginning, in the beginning. 
 Man gave names to all the animals 
 In the beginning, long time ago. 
 He saw an animal as smooth as glass 
 Slithering his way through the grass. 
 Saw him disappear by a tree near a lake ..."
216,Bob Dylan,rock,When He Returns,"The iron hand it ain't no match for the iron rod, 
 The strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty God. 
 For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears 
 It is only He who can reduce me to tears. 
 Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn 
 For like a thief in the night, He'll replace wrong with right 
 When He returns. 
 Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through, 
 He unleashed His power at an unknown hour that no one knew. 
 How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice? 
 How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness? 
 Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride? 
 Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease 
 Until He returns? 
 Surrender your crown on this blood-stained ground, take off your mask, 
 He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask. 
 How long can you falsify and deny what is real? 
 How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal? 
 Of every earthly plan that be known to man, He is unconcerned, 
 He's got plans of His own to set up His throne 
 When He returns."
217,Bob Dylan,rock,A Satisfied Mind,"How many times have you heard someone say 
 ""If I had his money, I could do things my way"" 
 But little they know that it's so hard to find 
 One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind 
 Once I was winning in fortune and fame 
 Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in life's game 
 But suddenly it happened, I lost every dime 
 But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind 
 Money can't buy back your youth when you're old 
 Or a friend when you're lonesome or a love that's grown cold 
 The wealthiest person is a pauper at times 
 Compared to the man with a satisfied mind 
 When life is over, my time has run out 
 My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt 
 But one thing for certain, when it comes my time 
 I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind"
218,Bob Dylan,rock,Saved,"I was blinded by the devil 
 Born already ruined 
 Stone-cold dead 
 As I stepped out of the womb 
 By His grace I have been touched 
 By His word I have been healed 
 By His hand I've been delivered 
 By His spirit I've been sealed 
 I've been saved 
 By the blood of the lamb 
 Saved 
 By the blood of the lamb 
 Saved 
 Saved 
 And I'm so glad 
 Yes, I'm so glad 
 I'm so glad 
 So glad 
 I want to thank You, Lord 
 I just want to thank You, Lord 
 Thank You, Lord 
 By His truth I can be upright 
 By His strength I do endure 
 By His power I've been lifted 
 In His love I am secure 
 He bought me with a price 
 Freed me from the pit 
 Full of emptiness and wrath 
 And the fire that burns in it 
 I've been saved 
 By the blood of the lamb 
 Saved 
 By the blood of the lamb 
 Saved

 And I'm so glad 
 Yes, I'm so glad 
 I'm so glad 
 So glad 
 I want to thank You, Lord 
 I just want to thank You, Lord 
 Thank You, Lord 
 Nobody to rescue me 
 Nobody would dare 
 I was going down for the last time 
 But by His mercy I've been spared 
 Not by works 
 But by faith in Him who called 
 For so long I've been hindered 
 For so long I've been stalled 
 I've been saved 
 By the blood of the lamb 
 Saved 
 By the blood of the lamb 
 Saved

 So glad, I want to thank You, Lord 
 I just want to thank You, Lord

 Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world 
 You know we are strangers in a land we're passing through

 Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide 
 And You've chosen me to be among the few

 You have laid down Your life for me

 You have explained every mystery

 Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it 
 Using all the devices under the sun.

 Is the saving grace that's over me. 
 Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding, 
 But to search for love, that ain't no more than vanity. 
 As I look around this world all that I'm finding 
 Is the saving grace that's over me. 
 The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it, 
 There's only one road and it leads to Calvary. 
 It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it 
 By the saving grace that's over me."
225,Bob Dylan,rock,Are You Ready?,"Are you ready, are you ready? 
 Are you ready, are you ready? 
 Are you ready to meet Jesus? 
 Are you where you ought to be? 
 Will He know you when He sees you 
 Or will He say, ""Depart from Me""? 
 Are you ready, hope you're ready. 
 Am I ready, am I ready? 
 Am I ready, am I ready? 
 Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren 
 And to take up my cross? 
 Have I surrendered to the will of God 
 Or am I still acting like the boss? 
 Am I ready, hope I'm ready. 
 When destruction cometh swiftly 
 And there's no time to say a fare-thee-well, 
 Have you decided whether you want to be 
 In heaven or in hell? 
 Are you ready, are you ready? 
 Have you got some unfinished business? 
 Is there something holding you back? 
 Are you thinking for yourself 
 Or are you following the pack? 
 Are you ready, hope you're ready. 
 Are you ready? 
 Are you ready for the judgment? 
 Are you ready for that terrible swift sword? 
 Are you ready for Armageddon? 
 Are you ready for the day of the Lord? 
 Are you ready, I hope you're ready."
226,Bob Dylan,rock,Shot Of Love,"I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love 
 Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease 
 Don't need a shot of turpentine, only bring me to my knees 
 Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent 
 Don't need a shot of whiskey, help me be president 
 I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love 
 Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid 
 I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's makin' me feel afraid 
 What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead 
 Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head 
 I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love 
 I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you 
 I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em too 
 Don't show me no picture show or give me no book to read 
 It don't satisfy the hurt inside nor the habit that I feed 
 I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love 
 Why would I want to take your life? 
 You've only murdered my father, raped his wife 
 Tattooed my babies with a poison pen 
 Mocked my God, humiliated my friends 
 I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love 
 Don't wanna be with nobody tonight Veronica not here 
 Mavis just ain't right 
 There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth and near 
 Am I supposed to sit back and wait until he's here? 
 I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love 
 What makes the wind wanna blow tonight? 
 Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't actin' right 
 Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away 
 My conscience is beginning to bother me today 
 I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love 
 I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love 
 If you're a doctor, I need a shot of love"
227,Bob Dylan,rock,Heart Of Mine,"Heart of mine be still 
 You can play with fire but you'll get the bill 
 Don't let her know 
 Don't let her know that you love her 
 Don't be a fool, don't be blind 
 Heart of mine 
 Heart of mine go back home 
 You got no reason to wander, no reason to roam 
 Don't let her see 
 Don't let her see that you need her 
 Don't put yourself over the line 
 Heart of mine 
 Heart of mine go back where you been 
 It'll only be trouble for you if you let her in 
 Don't let her hear 
 Don't let her know where your'e going 
 Don't untie the ties that bind 
 Heart of mine 
 Heart of mine so malicious and so full of guile 
 Give you an inch and you'll take a mile 
 Don't let yourself fall Don't let yourself stumble 
 If you can't do the time, don't do the crime 
 Heart of mine"
228,Bob Dylan,rock,Property Of Jesus,"Go ahead and talk about him 
 Because he makes you doubt 
 Because he has denied himself 
 The things that you can't live without 
 Laugh at him behind his back 
 Just like the others do 
 Remind him of what he used to be 
 When he comes walkin' through 
 He's the property of Jesus 
 Resent him to the bone 
 You got something better 
 You got a heart of stone 
 Stop your conversation 
 When he passes on the street 
 Hope he falls upon himself 
 Oh, won't that be sweet 
 Because he can't be exploited 
 By superstition anymore 
 Because he can't be bribed or bought 
 By the things that you adore 
 He's the property of Jesus 
 Resent him to the bone 
 You got something better 
 You got a heart of stone 
 When the whip that's keeping you in line 
 Doesn't make him jump 
 Say he's hard-of-hearin' 
 Say that he's a chump 
 Say he's out of step with reality 
 As you try to test his nerve 
 Because he doesn't pay tribute 
 To the king that you serve 
 He's the property of Jesus 
 Resent him to the bone 
 You got something better 
 You got a heart of stone 
 Say that he's a loser 
 'Cause he got no common sense 
 Because he don't increase his worth 
 At someone else's expense 
 Because he's not afraid of trying 
 Say he's got no style 
 'Cause he doesn't tell you jokes or fairy tales 
 Say he’s failed to make you smile 
 He's the property of Jesus 
 Resent him to the bone 
 You got something better 
 You got a heart of stone 
 You can laugh at salvation 
 You can play Olympic games 
 You think that when you rest at last 
 You'll go back from where you came 
 But you've picked up quite a story 
 And you've changed since the womb 
 What happened to the real you? 
 You've been captured, but by whom? 
 He's the property of Jesus 
 Resent him to the bone 
 You got something better 
 You got a heart of stone"
229,Bob Dylan,rock,Lenny Bruce,"Lenny Bruce is dead but his ghost lives on and on 
 Never did get any Golden Globe award, never made it to Synanon 
 He was an outlaw, that's for sure 
 More of an outlaw than you ever were 
 Lenny Bruce is gone but his spirit's livin' on and on 
 Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out 
 But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talkin' 
 About. Never robbed any churches nor cut off any babies' heads 
 He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their face 
 He's on some other shore, he didn't wanna live anymore 
 Lenny Bruce is dead but he didn't commit any crime 
 He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time 
 I rode with him in a taxi once, only for a mile and a half 
 Seemed like it took a couple of months 
 Lenny Bruce moved on and the ones that killed him, are gone 
 They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules 
 He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools 
 They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts 
 He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts 
 Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had"
230,Bob Dylan,rock,Watered Down Love,"Love that's pure hopes all things 
 Believes all things, won't pull no strings 
 Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark and handsome 
 Capture your soul and hold it for ransom 
 You don't want a love that's pure 
 You wanna drown love 
 You want a watered-down love 
 Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims 
 Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame 
 Will not deceive you or lead you to transgression 
 Won't write it up and make you sign a false confession 
 You don't want a love that's pure 
 You wanna drown love 
 You want a watered-down love 
 Love that's pure won't lead you astray 
 Won't hold you back, won't get in your way 
 Won't pervert you, corrupt you with stupid wishes 
 It don't make you envious, it don't make you suspicious 
 You don't want a love that's pure 
 You wanna drown love 
 You want a watered-down love 
 Love that's pure, no accident 
 It knows what it knows, is always content 
 An eternal flame, quietly burning 
 Never needs to be proud, restlessly yearning 
 You don't want a love that's pure 
 You wanna drown love 
 You want a watered-down love"
231,Bob Dylan,rock,The Groom's Still Waiting At The Altar,"Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement 
 Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent 
 Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face 
 Been treated like a farm animal on a wild goose chase 
 West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar 
 I see the burning of the page, Curtain risin' on a new age 
 See the groom still waitin' at the altar 
 Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery 
 Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your shyness for snobbery 
 Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me 
 About the madness of becomin' what one was never meant to be 
 West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar 
 I see the burning of the stage 
 Curtain risin' on a new age 
 See the groom still waitin' at the altar 
 Don't know what I can say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me 
 Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she began to want me 
 But I know God has mercy on them who are slandered and humiliated 
 I'd a-done anything for that woman if she didn't make me feel so obligated 
 West of the Jordan, west of the Rock of Gibraltar 
 I see the burning of the cage 
 Curtain risin' on a new stage 
 See the groom still waitin' at the altar 
 Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature? 
 I see people who are supposed to know better standin' around like furniture 
 There's a wall between you and what you want and you got to leap it 
 Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to 
 Keep it 
 West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar 
 I see the turnin' of the page, Curtain risin' on a new age 
 See the groom still waitin' at the altar 
 Cities on fire, phones out of order 
 They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border 
 What can I say about Claudette? 
 Ain't seen her since January 
 She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires 
 West of the Jordan, west of the Rock of Gibraltar 
 I see the turnin' of the page 
 Curtain risin' on a new age 
 See the groom still waitin' at the altar"
232,Bob Dylan,rock,"Dead Man, Dead Man","Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind 
 Clinging to strange promises, dying on the line 
 Never bein' able to separate the good from the bad 
 Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it 
 It's makin' me feel so sad 
 Dead man, dead man 
 When will you arise? 
 Cobwebs in your mind 
 Dust upon your eyes 
 Satan got you by the heel, there's a bird's nest in your hair 
 Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share? 
 The way that you hold your head, cursin' God with every move 
 Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it 
 What are you tryin' to prove? 
 Dead man, dead man 
 When will you arise? 
 Cobwebs in your mind 
 Dust upon your eyes 
 The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin 
 The ghetto that you build for me is the one your'e livin' in 
 The race of the engine that overrules your heart 
 Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it 
 Pretending that you're so smart 
 Dead man, dead man 
 When will you arise? 
 Cobwebs in your mind 
 Dust upon your eyes 
 What are you tryin' to overpower me with, the doctrine or the gun? 
 My back's to the wall, where can I run? 
 The tuxedo that you're wearin', the flower in your lapel 
 Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it 
 You wanna take me down to hell 
 Dead man, dead man 
 When will you arise? 
 Cobwebs in your mind 
 Dust upon your eyes"
233,Bob Dylan,rock,In The Summertime,"I was in your presence for an hour or so 
 Or was it a day? I truly don't know 
 Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low 
 By that soft and shining sea 
 Did you respect me for what I did 
 Or for what I didn't do, or for keeping it hid? 
 Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid 
 Of everything you see? 
 In the summertime, ah-a in the summertime 
 In the summertime when you were with me 
 I got the heart and you got the blood 
 We cut through iron and we cut through mud 
 Then came the warnin' that was before the flood 
 That set everybody free 
 Fools they made a mock of sin 
 Our loyalty they tried to win 
 But you were closer to me than my next of kin 
 When they didn't want to know or see 
 In the summertime, ah-a in the summertime 
 In the summertime when you were with me 
 Strangers, they meddled in our affairs 
 Poverty and shame was theirs 
 But all that sufferin' was not to be compared 
 With the glory that is to be 
 And I'm still carrying the gift you gave 
 It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved 
 It'll be with me unto the grave 
 And then unto eternity 
 In the summertime, ah-a in the summertime 
 In the summertime when you were with me"
234,Bob Dylan,rock,Trouble,"Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm 
 You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm 
 But they can't help you none when there's trouble 
 Trouble 
 Trouble, trouble, trouble 
 Nothin' but trouble 
 Trouble in the water, trouble in the air 
 Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there 
 Revolution even ain't no solution for trouble 
 Trouble 
 Trouble, trouble, trouble 
 Nothin' but trouble 
 Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul 
 Persecution, execution, governments out of control 
 You can see the writing on the wall inviting trouble 
 Trouble 
 Trouble, trouble, trouble 
 Nothin' but trouble 
 Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground 
 You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around? 
 Since the beginning of the universe man's been cursed by trouble 
 Trouble 
 Trouble, trouble, trouble 
 Nothin' but trouble 
 Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned 
 Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed 
 Look into infinity, all you see is trouble 
 Trouble 
 Trouble, trouble, trouble 
 Nothin' but trouble"
235,Bob Dylan,rock,Every Grain Of Sand,"In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need 
 When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed 
 There's a dyin' voice within me reaching out somewhere 
 Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair 
 Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake 
 Like Cain, I now behold this chain of events that I must break 
 In the fury of the moment I can see the Master's hand 
 In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand 
 Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear 
 Like criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer 
 The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way 
 To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay 
 I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame 
 And every time I pass that way I always hear my name 
 Then onward in my journey I come to understand 
 That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand 
 I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night 
 In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light 
 In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space 
 In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face 
 I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea 
 Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me 
 I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man 
 Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand"
236,Bob Dylan,rock,Jokerman,"Standing on the water casting your bread 
 While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing. 
 Distant ships sailing into the mist, 
 You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing. 
 Freedom just around the corner for you 
 But with truth so far off, what good will it do? 
 Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune, 
 Bird fly high by the light of the moon, 
 Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman. 
 So swiftly the sun sets in the sky, 
 You rise up and say goodbye to no one. 
 Fools rush in where angels fear to tread, 
 Both of their futures, so full of dread, you don't show one. 
 Shedding off one more layer of skin, 
 Keeping one step ahead of the persecutor within. 
 Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune, 
 Bird fly high by the light of the moon, 
 Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman. 
 You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds, 
 Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream twister. 
 You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah 
 But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister. 
 Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame, 
 You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name. 
 Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune, 
 Bird fly high by the light of the moon, 
 Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman. 
 Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy, 
 The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers. 
 In the smoke of the twilight on a milk-white steed, 
 Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features. 
 Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space, 
 Half asleep neath the stars with a small dog licking your face. 
 Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune, 
 Bird fly high by the light of the moon, 
 Oh. oh. oh. Jokerman. 
 Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame, 
 Preacherman seeks the same, who'll get there first is uncertain. 
 Nightsticks and water cannons, tear gas, padlocks, 
 Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain, 
 False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin, 
 Only a matter of time 'til night comes steppin' in. 
 Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune, 
 Bird fly high by the light of the moon, 
 Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman. 
 It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray, 
 A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet. 
 He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat, 
 Take the motherless children off the street 
 And place them at the feet of a harlot. 
 Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants, 
 Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response. 
 Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune, 
 Bird fly high by the light of the moon, 
 Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman."
237,Bob Dylan,rock,Sweetheart Like You,"Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here, 
 He gone North, for a while, 
 They say that vanity got the best of him 
 But he sure left here in style. 
 By the way, that's a cute hat, 
 And a smile so hard to resist 
 What's a sweetheart like you doin' in a dump like this? 
 You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you, 
 She wanted a whole man, not just a half, 
 She used to call me sweet daddy when I was only a child, 
 You kind of remind me of her when you laugh. 
 In order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear, 
 It's done with a flick of the wrist. 
 What's a sweetheart like you doin' in a dump like this? 
 You know, a woman like you should be at home, 
 That's where you belong, 
 Taking care of somebody nice, 
 Who don't know how to do you wrong. 
 Just how much abuse will you be able to take? 
 Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss. 
 What's a sweetheart like you doin' in a dump like this? 
 You know you can make a name for yourself, 
 You can hear them tires squeal, 
 You could be known as the most beautiful woman 
 Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal. 
 You know, news of you has come down the line 
 Even before ya came in the door. 
 They say in your father's house, there's many mansions 
 Each one of them got a fireproof floor. 
 Snap out of it, baby, people are jealous of you, 
 They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss. 
 What's a sweetheart like you doin' in a dump like this? 
 Got to be an important person to be in here, honey, 
 Got to have done some evil deed, 
 Got to have your own harem when you come in the door, 
 Got to play your harp until your lips bleed. 
 They say that patriotism is the last refuge 
 To which a scoundrel clings. 
 Steal a little and they throw you in jail, 
 Steal a lot and they make you king. 
 There's only one step down from here, baby, 
 It's called the land of permanent bliss. 
 What's a sweetheart like you doin' in a dump like this?"
238,Bob Dylan,rock,Neighborhood Bully,"Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man, 
 His enemies say he's on their land. 
 They got him outnumbered about a million to one, 
 He got no place to escape to, no place to run. 
 He's the neighborhood bully. 
 The neighborhood bully he just lives to survive, 
 He's criticized and condemned for being alive. 
 Not supposed to fight back, and have thick skin, 
 Supposed to lay down and die when his door is kicked in. 
 He's the neighborhood bully. 
 Neighborhood bully been driven out of every land, 
 He's wandered the earth an exiled man. 
 Seen his family scattered, his people hounded and torn, 
 He's always on trial for just being born. 
 He's the neighborhood bully. 
 Well, he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized, 
 Old women condemned him, said he should apologize. 
 Then he destroyed a bomb factory, nobody was glad. 
 The bombs were meant for him. 
 He was supposed to feel bad. 
 He's the neighborhood bully. 
 Well, the chances are against it and the odds are slim 
 That he'll live by the rules that the world makes for him, 
 There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back 
 And a license to kill him given out to every maniac. 
 He's the neighborhood bully. 
 Well he got no allies to really speak of. 
 What he gets he must pay for, he don't get it out of love. 
 He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied 
 But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side. 
 He's the neighborhood bully. 
 Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace, 
 They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease. 
 Now, they wouldn't hurt a fly. 
 To hurt one they would weep. 
 They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep. 
 He's the neighborhood bully. 
 Every empire that's enslaved him is gone, 
 Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon. 
 He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand, 
 In bed with nobody, under no one's command. 
 He's the neighborhood bully. 
 Now his holiest books have been trampled upon, 
 No contract he signed was worth what it was written on. 
 He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth, 
 Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health. 
 He's the neighborhood bully. 
 What's anybody indebted to him for? 
 Nothin', they say. 
 He just likes to cause war. 
 His pride and prejudice his superstition indeed, 
 They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed. 
 He's the neighborhood bully. 
 What has he done to wear so many scars? 
 Does he change the course of rivers? 
 Does he pollute the moon and stars? 
 Neighborhood bully, standing on the hill, 
 Running out the clock, time standing still, 
 Neighborhood bully."
239,Bob Dylan,rock,Licence To Kill,"Man thinks 'cause he rules the earth he can do with it as he please 
 And if things don't change soon, he will. 
 For man has invented his doom,

 Now, there's a woman on my block, 
 She just sit there as the night grows still. 
 She say who gonna take away his license to kill? 
 Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life 
 And they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill, 
 Then they bury him with stars, 
 Sell his body like they do used cars. 
 Now, there's a woman on my block, 
 She just sit there facin' the hill. 
 She say who gonna take away his license to kill? 
 Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused, 
 And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill. 
 All he believes are his eyes 
 And his eyes, they just tell him lies. 
 But there's a woman on my block, 
 Sitting there in a cold chill. 
 She say who gonna take away his license to kill? 
 May be a noisemaker, spirit maker, 
 Heartbreaker, backbreaker, 
 Leave no stone unturned. 
 May be an actor in a plot, 
 That might be all that you got 
 'Til your error you clearly learn. 
 Now he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool 
 And when he sees his reflection, he's fulfilled. 
 Oh, man is opposed to fair play, 
 He wants it all and he wants it his way.

 She just sit there as the night grows still. 
 She say who gonna take away his license to kill?"

 Could be the local priest.

 Satan you know he come as a man of peace. 
 He got a sweet gift of gab, he got a harmonious tongue, 
 Know every song of love that ever has been sung. 
 Good intentions can be evil, 
 Both hands can be full of grease. 
 You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace.

 No, not even the Chief of Police.

 Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun, 
 Catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton. 
 He could be standing next to you, 
 The person that you'd notice least. 
 I hear that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace. 
 Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull, 
 He can ride down Niagara Falls in the barrels of your skull. 
 I can smell something cooking, 
 I can tell there's going to be a feast. 
 You know that sometimes Satan will come as a man of peace. 
 He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist, 
 He knows just where to touch you, honey, and how you like to be kissed. 
 He'll put both his arms around you, 
 You can feel the tender touch of the beast. 
 You know sometimes Satan will come as a man of peace. 
 Well, the howling wolf will howl tonight, the king snake will crawl, 
 Trees that've stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall. 
 Wanna get married? Do it now, 
 Tomorrow all activity will cease. 
 You know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace. 
 Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy, 
 She's holding them little white shoes and that little broken toy 
 And he's following a star, 
 The same one them three men followed from the East.

 And the pearls are from Japan. 
 Well, the dog collar's from India 
 And the flower pot's from Pakistan. 
 All the furniture, it says ""Made in Brazil"" 
 Where a woman, she slaved for sure 
 Bringin' home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve, 
 You know, that's a lot of money to her. 
 Well, it's sundown on the union 
 And what's made in the U.S.A. 
 Sure was a good idea 
 'Til greed got in the way. 
 Well, you know, lots of people complainin' that there is no work. 
 I say, ""Why you say that for 
 When nothin' you got is U.S.-made?"" 
 They don't make nothin' here no more, 
 You know, capitalism is above the law. 
 It say, ""It don't count 'less it sells."" 
 When it costs too much to build it at home 
 You just build it cheaper someplace else. 
 Well, it's sundown on the union 
 And what's made in the U.S.A. 
 Sure was a good idea 
 'Til greed got in the way. 
 Well, the job that you used to have, 
 They give it to somebody down in El Salvador. 
 The unions are big business, friend, 
 And they're goin' out like a dinosaur. 
 Well they used to grow food in Kansas 
 Now they want to grow it on the moon and eat it raw. 
 I can see the day coming when even your home garden 
 Is gonna be against the law. 
 Well, it's sundown on the union 
 And what's made in the U.S.A. 
 Sure was a good idea 
 'Til greed got in the way. 
 Democracy don't rule the world, 
 You'd better get that in your head. 
 This world is ruled by violence 
 But I guess that's better left unsaid. 
 From Broadway to the Milky Way, 
 That's a lot of territory indeed 
 And a man's gonna do what he has to do 
 When he's got a hungry mouth to feed. 
 Well, it's sundown on the union 
 And what's made in the U.S.A. 
 Sure was a good idea 
 'Til greed got in the way."
242,Bob Dylan,rock,I And I,"Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed. 
 Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams. 
 In another lifetime she must have owned the world, or been faithfully wed 
 To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams. 
 I and I 
 In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives. 
 I and I 
 One said to the other, no man sees my face and lives. 
 Think I'll go out and go for a walk, 
 Not much happenin' here, nothin' ever does. 
 Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want me to talk 
 I got nothin' to say, 'specially about whatever was. 
 I and I 
 In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives. 
 I and I 
 One said to the other, no man sees my face and lives. 
 Took an untrodden path once, where the swift don't win the race, 
 It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth. 
 Took a stranger to teach me, to look into justice's beautiful face 
 And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. 
 I and I 
 In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives. 
 I and I 
 One said to the other, no man sees my face and lives. 
 Outside of two men on a train platform there's nobody in sight, 
 They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track. 
 The world could come to an end tonight, but that's all right. 
 She should still be there sleepin' when I get back. 
 I and I 
 In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives. 
 I and I 
 One said to the other, no man sees my face and lives. 
 Noontime, and I'm still pushin' myself along the road, the darkest part, 
 Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put. 
 Someone else is speakin' with my mouth, but I'm listening only to my heart. 
 I've made shoes for everyone, even you, while I still go barefoot. 
 I and I 
 In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives. 
 I and I 
 One said to the other, no man sees my face and lives."
243,Bob Dylan,rock,Don't Fall Apart On Me Tonight,"Just a minute before you leave, girl, 
 Just a minute before you touch the door. 
 What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl? 
 Do you think we can talk about it some more? 
 You know, the streets are filled with vipers 
 Who've lost all ray of hope, 
 You know, it ain't even safe no more 
 In the palace of the Pope. 
 Don't fall apart on me tonight, 
 I just don't think that I could handle it. 
 Don't fall apart on me tonight, 
 Yesterday's just a memory, 
 Tomorrow is never what it's supposed to be 
 And I need you, yeah. 
 Come over here from over there, girl, 
 Sit down here. You can have my chair. 
 I can't see us goin' anywhere, girl. 
 The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there. 
 I wish I'd have been a doctor, 
 Maybe I'd have saved some life that had been lost, 
 Maybe I'd have done some good in the world 
 'Stead of burning every bridge I crossed. 
 Don't fall apart on me tonight, 
 I just don't think that I could handle it. 
 Don't fall apart on me tonight, 
 Yesterday's just a memory, 
 Tomorrow is never what it's supposed to be 
 And I need you, oh, yeah. 
 I ain't too good at conversation, girl, 
 So you might not know exactly how I feel, 
 But if I could, I'd bring you to the mountaintop, girl, 
 And build you a house made out of stainless steel. 
 But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting 
 That's hanging in the Louvre, 
 My throat start to tickle and my nose itches 
 But I know that I can't move. 
 Don't fall apart on me tonight, 
 I just don't think that I could handle it. 
 Don't fall apart on me tonight, 
 Yesterday's gone but the past lives on, 
 Tomorrow's just one step beyond 
 And I need you, oh, yeah. 
 Who are these people who are walking towards you? 
 Do you know them or will there be a fight? 
 With their humorless smiles so easy to see through, 
 Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right? 
 Do you remember St. James Street 
 Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind? 
 You were so fine, Clark Gable would have fell at your feet 
 And laid his life on the line. 
 Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl, 
 No more booby traps and bombs, 
 No more decadence and charm, 
 No more affection that's misplaced, girl, 
 No more mudcake creatures lying in your arms. 
 What about that millionaire with the drumsticks in his pants? 
 He looked so baffled and so bewildered 
 When he played and we didn't dance. 
 Don't fall apart on me tonight, 
 I just don't think that I could handle it. 
 Don't fall apart on me tonight, 
 Yesterday's just a memory, 
 Tomorrow is never what it's supposed to be 
 And I need you, yeah."
244,Bob Dylan,rock,Tight Connection To My Heart,"Well, I had to move fast 
 And I couldn't with you around my neck. 
 I said I'd send for you and I did 
 What did you expect? 
 My hands are sweating 
 And we haven't even started yet. 
 I'll go along with the charade 
 Until I can think my way out. 
 I know it was all a big joke 
 Whatever it was about. 
 Someday maybe 
 I'll remember to forget. 
 I'm gonna get my coat, 
 I feel the breath of a storm. 
 There's something I've got to do tonight, 
 You go inside and stay warm. 
 Has anybody seen my love, 
 Has anybody seen my love, 
 Has anybody seen my love. 
 I don't know, 
 Has anybody seen my love? 
 You want to talk to me, 
 Go ahead and talk. 
 Whatever you got to say to me 
 Won't come as any shock. 
 I must be guilty of something, 
 You just whisper it into my ear. 
 Madame Butterfly 
 She lulled me to sleep, 
 In a town without pity 
 Where the water runs deep. 
 She said, ""Be easy, baby, 
 There ain't nothin' worth stealin' in here."" 
 You're the one I've been looking for, 
 You're the one that's got the key. 
 But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you 
 Or you're too good for me. 
 Has anybody seen my love, 
 Has anybody seen my love, 
 Has anybody seen my love. 
 I don't know, 
 Has anybody seen my love? 
 Well, they're not showing any lights tonight 
 And there's no moon. 
 There's just a hot-blooded singer 
 Singing ""Memphis in June,"" 
 While they're beatin' the devil out of a guy 
 Who's wearing a powder-blue wig. 
 Later he'll be shot 
 For resisting arrest, 
 I can still hear his voice crying 
 In the wilderness. 
 What looks large from a distance, 
 Close up ain't never that big. 
 Never could learn to drink that blood 
 And call it wine, 
 Never could learn to hold you, love, 
 And call you mine."
245,Bob Dylan,rock,Seeing The Real You At Last,"Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down 
 But it looks like it don't. 
 I'd like to get you to change your mind 
 But it looks like you won't. 
 From now on I'll be busy, 
 Ain't goin' nowhere fast. 
 I'm just glad it's over 
 And I'm seeing the real you at last. 
 Well, didn't I risk my neck for you, 
 Didn't I take chances? 
 Didn't I rise above it all for you, 
 The most unfortunate circumstances? 
 Well, I have had some rotten nights, 
 Didn't think that they would pass. 
 I'm just thankful and grateful 
 To be seeing the real you at last. 
 I'm hungry and I'm irritable 
 And I'm tired of this bag of tricks. 
 At one time there was nothing wrong with me 
 That you could not fix. 
 Well, I sailed through the storm 
 Strapped to the mast, 
 But the time has come 
 And I'm seeing the real you at last. 
 When I met you, baby, 
 You didn't show no visible scars. 
 You could ride like Annie Oakley, 
 You could shoot like Belle Starr. 
 Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble, 
 Trouble always comes to pass 
 But all I care about now 
 Is that I'm seeing the real you at last. 
 Well, I'm gonna quit this baby talk now, 
 I guess I should have known. 
 I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles, 
 I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone. 
 Whatever you gonna do, 
 Please do it fast. 
 I'm still trying to get used to 
 Seeing the real you at last."
246,Bob Dylan,rock,I'll Remember You,"I'll remember you 
 When I've forgotten all the rest, 
 You to me were true, 
 You to me were the best. 
 When there is no more, 
 You cut to the core 
 Quicker than anyone I knew. 
 When I'm all alone 
 In the great unknown, 
 I'll remember you. 
 I'll remember you 
 At the end of the trail, 
 I had so much left to do, 
 I had so little time to fail. 
 There's some people that 
 You don't forget, 
 Even though you've only seen'm 
 One time or two. 
 When the roses fade 
 And I'm in the shade, 
 I'll remember you. 
 Didn't I, didn't I try to love you? 
 Didn't I, didn't I try to care? 
 Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you 
 With the rain blowing in your hair? 
 I'll remember you 
 When the wind blows through the piney wood. 
 It was you who came right through, 
 It was you who understood. 
 Though I'd never say 
 That I done it the way 
 That you'd have liked me to. 
 In the end, 
 My dear sweet friend, 
 I'll remember you."
247,Bob Dylan,rock,Clean-Cut Kid,"Everybody wants to know why he couldn't adjust 
 Adjust to what, a dream that bust? 
 He was a clean-cut kid 
 But they made a killer out of him, 
 That's what they did 
 They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is 
 They put ideas in his head he thought were his 
 He was a clean-cut kid 
 But they made a killer out of him, 
 That's what they did 
 He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band 
 When he was ten years old he had a watermelon stand 
 He was a clean-cut kid 
 But they made a killer out of him, 
 That's what they did 
 He went to church on Sunday, he was a Boy Scout 
 For his friends he would turn his pockets inside out 
 He was a clean-cut kid 
 But they made a killer out of him, 
 That's what they did 
 They said, ""Listen boy, you're just a pup"" 
 They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up 
 They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills, 
 A jeep to drive, blood to spill 
 They said ""Congratulations, you got what it takes"" 
 They sent him back into the rat race without any brakes 
 He was a clean-cut kid 
 But they made a killer out of him, 
 That's what they did 
 He bought the American dream but it put him in debt 
 The only game he could play was Russian roulette 
 He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread, 
 Ate Burger Kings, he was well fed 
 He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole 
 He stole a Rolls Royce and drove it in a swimming pool 
 They took a clean-cut kid 
 And they made a killer out of him, 
 That's what they did 
 He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar 
 Could've been an accountant or a tennis star 
 He was wearing boxing gloves, took a dive one day 
 Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay 
 His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans 
 They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own 
 They took a clean-cut kid 
 And they made a killer out of him, 
 That's what they did 
 Well, everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust 
 All he ever wanted was somebody to trust 
 They took his head and turned it inside out 
 He never did know what it was all about 
 He had a steady job, he joined the choir 
 He never did plan to walk the high wire 
 They took a clean-cut kid 
 And they made a killer out of him, 
 That's what they did"
248,Bob Dylan,rock,Never Gonna Be The Same Again,"Now you're here beside me, baby, 
 You're a living dream. 
 And every time you get this close 
 It makes me want to scream. 
 You touched me and you knew 
 That I was warm for you and then, 
 I ain't never gonna be the same again. 
 Sorry if I hurt you, baby, 
 Sorry if I did. 
 Sorry if I touched the place 
 Where your secrets are hid. 
 But you meant more than everything, 
 And I could not pretend, 
 I ain't never gonna be the same again. 
 You give me something to think about, baby, 
 Every time I see ya. 
 Don't worry, baby, I don't mind leaving, 
 I'd just like it to be my idea. 
 You taught me how to love you, baby, 
 You taught me, oh, so well. 
 Now, I can't go back to what was, baby, 
 I can't unring the bell. 
 You took my reality 
 And cast it to the wind 
 And I ain't never gonna be the same again."
249,Bob Dylan,rock,Trust Yourself,"Trust yourself, 
 Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best. 
 Trust yourself, 
 Trust yourself to do what's right and not be second-guessed. 
 Don't trust me to show you beauty 
 When beauty may only turn to rust. 
 If you need somebody you can trust, trust yourself. 
 Trust yourself, 
 Trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end. 
 Trust yourself, 
 Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when. 
 Don't trust me to show you the truth 
 When the truth may only be ashes and dust. 
 If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself. 
 Well, you're on your own, you always were, 
 In a land of wolves and thieves. 
 Don't put your hope in ungodly man 
 Or be a slave to what somebody else believes. 
 Trust yourself 
 And you won't be disappointed when vain people let you down. 
 Trust yourself 
 And look not for answers where no answers can be found. 
 Don't trust me to show you love 
 When my love may be only lust. 
 If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself."
250,Bob Dylan,rock,Emotionally Yours,"Come baby find me 
 Come baby remind me 
 Of where I once begun 
 Come baby show me 
 Show me you know me 
 Tell me you're the one 
 I could be learning 
 You could be yearning 
 To see behind closed doors 
 But I will always be 
 Emotionally yours 
 Come baby rock me 
 Come baby lock me 
 Into the shadows of your heart 
 Come baby teach me 
 Come baby reach me 
 Let the music start 
 I could be dreaming 
 But I keep believing 
 You're the one I'm living for 
 And I will always be 
 Emotionally yours 
 It's like my whole life never happened 
 When I see you its as if I never had a thought 
 I know this dream it might be crazy 
 But it's the only one I've got 
 Come baby shake me 
 Come baby take me 
 I would be satisfied 
 Come baby hold me 
 Come baby help me 
 My arms are open wide 
 I could be unravelling 
 Wherever I'm travelling 
 Even to foreign shores 
 But I will always be 
 Emotionally yours"
251,Bob Dylan,rock,When The Night Comes Falling From The Sky,"Look out across the fields, see me returning 
 Smoke is in your eye, you draw a smile 
 From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning 
 You've had time to think about it for a while 
 Well, I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over 
 It's the end of the chase and the moon is high 
 It won't matter who loves who 
 You'll love me or I'll love you 
 When the night comes falling from the sky 
 I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting 
 Sorrow covers you up like a cape 
 Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting 
 With disaster that you managed to escape 
 I can't provide for you no easy answers 
 Who are you that I should have to lie? 
 You'll know all about it, love 
 It'll fit you like a glove 
 When the night comes falling from the sky 
 I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river 
 You must have been protecting someone last time I called 
 I've never asked you for nothing you couldn't deliver 
 I've never asked you to set yourself up for a fall 
 I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness 
 For the love of a lousy buck, I've watched them die 
 Stick around, baby, we're not through 
 Don't look for me, I'll see you 
 When the night comes falling from the sky 
 In your teardrops, I can see my own reflection 
 It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line 
 I don't want to be a fool starving for affection 
 I don't want to drown in someone else's wine 
 For all eternity I think I will remember 
 That icy wind that's howling in your eye 
 You will seek me and you'll find me In the wasteland of your mind 
 When the night comes falling from the sky 
 Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter 
 But you were gambling for support 
 This time tomorrow I'll know you better 
 When my memory is not so short 
 This time I'm asking for freedom 
 Freedom from a world which you deny 
 And you'll give it to me now 
 I'll take it anyhow 
 When the night comes falling from the sky"
252,Bob Dylan,rock,"Something's Burning, Baby","Something is burning, baby, are you aware? 
 Something is the matter, baby, there's smoke in your hair 
 Are you still my friend, baby, show me a sign 
 Is the love in your heart for me turning blind? 
 You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while 
 The truth that I'm seeking is in your missing file 
 What's your position, baby, what's going on? 
 Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone? 
 I know everything about this place, or so it seems 
 Am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams? 
 Well, it is so obvious that something has changed 
 What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange? 
 Something is burning, baby, here's what I say 
 Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today 
 I see the shadow of a man, baby, makin' you blue 
 Who is he, baby, and what's he to you? 
 We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins 
 Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins 
 But where do you live, baby, and where is the light? 
 Why are your eyes just staring off in the night? 
 I can feel it in the night when I think of you 
 I can feel it in the light and it's got to be true 
 You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied 
 You can't roll away the stone if your hands are tied 
 Got to start someplace, baby, can you explain? 
 Please don't fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train 
 Answer me, baby, a casual look will do 
 Just what in the world has come over you? 
 I can feel it in the wind and it's upside down 
 I can feel it in the dust as I get off the bus on the outskirts of town 
 I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve 
 I don't wanna see you bleed, I know what you need but it ain't what you deserve 
 Something is burning, baby, something's in flames 
 There's a man going 'round calling names 
 Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you 
 I believe in the impossible, you know that I do"
253,Bob Dylan,rock,Dark Eyes,"Oh, the gentlemen are talking and the midnight moon is on the riverside 
 They're drinking up and walking and it is time for me to slide 
 I live in another world where life and death are memorized 
 Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls and all I see are dark eyes 
 A cock is crowing far away and another soldier's deep in prayer 
 Some mother's child has gone astray, she can't find him anywhere 
 But I can hear another drum beating for the dead that rise 
 Whom nature's beast fears as they come and all I see are dark eyes 
 They tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes 
 They tell me revenge is sweet and from where they stand, I'm sure it is 
 But I feel nothing for their game where beauty goes unrecognized 
 All I feel is heat and flame and all I see are dark eyes 
 Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel 
 Hunger pays a heavy price to the falling gods of speed and steel 
 Oh, time is short and the days are sweet and passion rules the arrow that flies 
 A million faces at my feet but all I see are dark eyes"
254,Bob Dylan,rock,You Wanna Ramble,"Well I told my baby 
 I said Baby, I know where you been 
 Well, I know who you are 
 And what league you played in 
 You wanna ramble 
 To the break of dawn 
 You wanna ramble 
 To the break of dawn 
 You wanna ramble 
 To the break of dawn. 
 Well, the night is so empty 
 So quit and still 
 For only fifteen hundred dollars 
 You can have anybody killed 
 You wanna ramble 
 To the break of dawn 
 You wanna ramble 
 To the break of dawn 
 You wanna ramble 
 To the break of dawn. 
 Well, I told my baby 
 Further down the line 
 I said, ?What happens tomorrow 
 Is on your head, not mine? 
 You wanna ramble 
 To the break of dawn 
 You wanna ramble 
 To the break of dawn 
 You wanna ramble 
 To the break of dawn."

 He would not bow down, he would not fight. 
 He knew the deal was a-down and dirty. 
 And nothing wrong could make it right away. 
 But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay. 
 Just another holy man who dared to be a friend. 
 My God, they killed him. 
 Another man from Atlanta, Georgia, 
 Name of Martin Luther King 
 He shook the land like a rolling thunder 
 And made the bells of freedom ring today 
 With a dream of beauty that they could not take away 
 Just another holy man who dared to make a stand. 
 My God, they killed him. 
 The only Son of God Almighty 
 The holy one called Jesus Christ 
 He healed the sick and fed the hungry 
 And for his love they took his life away 
 On the road to glory where the story never ends 
 Just the holy Son of Man I'll never understand. 
 My God, they killed him.

 Or who you thought you were talkin' to. 
 I figure maybe we're even 
 Or maybe I'm one up on you. 
 I send you all my money 
 Just like I did before. 
 I tried to reach you honey, 
 But you're driftin' too far from shore. 
 Driftin' too far from shore 
 Driftin' too far from shore 
 Driftin' too far from shore 
 Driftin' too far from shore 
 I ain't gonna get lost in this current, 
 I don't like playing cat and mouse. 
 No gentleman likes making love to a servant. 
 Especially when he's in his father's house. 
 I never could guess your weight, baby, 
 Never needed to call you my whore. 
 I always thought you were straight, baby, 
 But you're driftin' too far from shore. 
 Driftin' too far from shore 
 Driftin' too far from shore 
 Driftin' too far from shore 
 Driftin' too far from shore 
 Well these times and these tunnels are haunted, 
 The bottom of the barrel is too. 
 I waited years sometimes for what I wanted. 
 Everybody can't be as lucky as you. 
 Never no more do I wonder, 
 Why you don't never play with me any more. 
 At any moment you could go under, 
 'Cause you're driftin' too far from shore. 
 Driftin' too far from shore 
 Driftin' too far from shore 
 Driftin' too far from shore 
 Driftin' too far from shore 
 You and me we had completeness, 
 I give you all of what I could provide 
 We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness, 
 We were the wrong side. 
 I've already ripped out the phones, honey. 
 You can't walk the streets in a war. 
 I can finish this alone, honey, 
 You're driftin' too far from shore."
257,Bob Dylan,rock,Precious Memories,"As I travel down life's pathway 
 Know not what the years may hold 
 As I ponder, hopes grow fonder 
 Precious memories flood my soul 
 Precious father, loving mother 
 Glide across the lonely years 
 And old homes scenes of my childhood 
 In fond memory appears 
 Precious memories, how they linger 
 How they ever flood my soul 
 In the stillness of the midnight 
 Precious sacred scenes unfold"
258,Bob Dylan,rock,Maybe Someday,"Maybe someday you'll be satisfied 
 When you've lost everything you'll have nothing left to hide 
 When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks 
 Maybe you'll beg me to take you back 
 Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool 
 Maybe then you'll realize what it would have taken to keep me cool 
 Maybe someday when you're by yourself alone 
 You'll know the love that I had for you was never my own 
 Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn 
 You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned 
 You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim 
 And you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him 
 Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns 
 Thirty pieces of silver, no money down 
 Maybe someday, you will understand 
 That something for nothing is everybody's plan 
 Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt 
 When there was blood on the moon in the cotton belt 
 When both of us, baby, were going though some sort of a test 
 Neither one of us could do what we do best 
 I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff 
 I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough 
 Maybe someday, you'll believe me when I say 
 That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way 
 Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high 
 Sayin' ""For whose sake did you live, for whose sake did you die?"" 
 Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do 
 For not breakin' down no bedroom door to get at you 
 Always was a sucker for the right cross 
 Never wanted to go home 'til the last cent was lost 
 Maybe someday you will look back and see 
 That I made it so easy for you to follow me 
 Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell 
 I'm just as happy as you, baby, I just can't say it so well 
 Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike 
 There's no excuse for you to say that we don't think alike 
 You said you were going' to Frisco, stay a couple of months 
 I always liked San Francisco, I was there for a party once 
 Maybe someday you'll see that it's true 
 There was no greater love than what I had for you"
259,Bob Dylan,rock,Brownsville Girl,"Well, there was this movie I seen one time, 
 About a man riding 'cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck. 
 He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself. 
 The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck. 
 Well, the marshal, now he beat that kid to a bloody pulp 
 As the dying gunfighter lay in the sun and gasped for his last breath. 
 Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square, 
 I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death. 
 Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in 
 And you know it blows right through me like a ball and chain. 
 You know I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart. 
 The memory of you keeps callin' after me like a rollin' train. 
 I can still see the day that you came to me on the painted desert 
 In your busted down Ford and your platform heels 
 I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet 
 Ah, but you were right. It was perfect as I got in behind the wheel. 
 Well, we drove that car all night into San Anton' 
 And we slept near the Alamo, your skin was so tender and soft. 
 Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back. 
 I would have gone on after you but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off. 
 Well, we're drivin' this car and the sun is comin' up over the Rockies, 
 Now I know she ain't you but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul. 
 But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore to remember the times when I was your only man 
 And she don't want to remind me. She knows this car would go out of control. 
 Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls, teeth like pearls shining like the moon above 
 Brownsville girl, show me all around the world, Brownsville girl, you're my honey love. 
 Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo 
 We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live. He owned a wreckin' lot outside of town about a mile. 
 Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back. She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust. 
 She said, ""Henry ain't here but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."" 
 Then she told us how times were tough and about how she was thinkin' of bummin' a ride back to where she started. 
 But ya know, she changed the subject every time money came up. 
 She said, ""Welcome to the land of the living dead."" You could tell she was so broken-hearted. 
 She said, ""Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."" 
 ""How far are y'all going?"" Ruby asked us with a sigh. 
 ""We're going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn, 
 Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."" 
 Ruby just smiled and said, ""Ah, you know some babies never learn."" 
 Something about that movie though, well I just can't get it out of my head 
 But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play. 
 All I remember about it was Gregory Peck and the way people moved 
 And a lot of them seemed to be lookin' my way. 
 Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls, teeth like pearls shining like the moon above 
 Brownsville girl, show me all around the world, Brownsville girl, you're my honey love. 
 Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour. 
 I was crossin' the street when shots rang out. 
 I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran. 
 ""We got him cornered in the churchyard,"" I heard somebody shout. 
 Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune. Underneath it, it said, ""A man with no alibi."" 
 You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you. 
 Then when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears, 
 It was the best acting I saw anybody do. 
 Now I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass but sometimes you just find yourself over the line. 
 Oh if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now. 
 You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't sayin' much. I could feel a whole lot better, 
 If you were just here by my side to show me how. 
 Well, I'm standin' in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck, 
 Yeah, but you know it's not the one that I had in mind. 
 He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about 
 But I'll see him in anything so I'll stand in line. 
 Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls, teeth like pearls shining like the moon above 
 Brownsville girl, show me all around the world, Brownsville girl, you're my honey love. 
 You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned. 
 The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter is that his name wasn't Henry Porter. 
 And you know there was somethin' about you baby that I liked that was always too good for this world 
 Just like you always said there was something about me you liked that I left behind in the French Quarter. 
 Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections than people who are most content. 
 I don't have any regrets, they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone. 
 You always said people don't do what they believe in, they just do what's most convenient, then they repent. 
 And I always said, ""Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."" 
 There was a movie I seen one time, I think I sat through it twice. 
 I don't remember who I was or where I was bound. 
 All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck, he wore a gun and he was shot in the back. 
 Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down. 
 Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls, teeth like pearls shining like the moon above 
 Brownsville girl, show me all around the world, Brownsville girl, you're my honey love."
260,Bob Dylan,rock,Got My Mind Made Up,"Don't ever try to change me 
 I been in this thing too long 
 There's nothin' you can say or do 
 To make me think I'm wrong 
 Well, I'm goin' off to Libya 
 There's a guy I gotta see 
 He's been living there three years now 
 In an oil refinery 
 I've got my mind made up 
 Oh, I 've got my mind made up 
 Call your Ma in Tallahassee 
 Tell her her baby's on the line 
 Tell her not to worry 
 Everything is gonna be fine 
 Well, I gave you all my money 
 All my connections, too 
 There ain't nothin' in this world, girl 
 You can say I didn't give to you 
 I've got my mind made up 
 I've got my mind made up 
 You will be alright, girl 
 Someone's watchin' over you 
 He won't do nothin' to you 
 Baby that I wouldn't do 
 Well, if you don't want to see me 
 Look the other way 
 You don't have to feed me 
 I ain't your dog that's gone astray 
 I got my mind made up 
 I got my mind made up 
 I got my mind made up 
 I got my mind made up

261,Bob Dylan,rock,Under Your Spell,"Something about you that I can't shake 
 Don't know how much of this I can take 
 Baby, I'm under your spell 
 I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night 
 When my last dream exploded, I noticed your light 
 Baby, oh what a story I could tell 
 It's been nice seeing you, you read me like a book 
 If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look 
 Baby, I'll be at the same hotel 
 I'd like to help you but I'm in a bit of a jam 
 I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am 
 Baby, caught between heaven and hell 
 But I will be back, I will survive 
 You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive 
 Baby, can't you tell 
 Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds 
 I'm starin' at your picture, I'm hearin' your words 
 Baby, they ring in my head like a bell 
 Everywhere you go it's enough to break hearts 
 Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts 
 You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow 
 I trusted you, baby, you can trust me now 
 Turn back, baby, wipe your eye 
 Don't think I 'm leaving you here without a kiss goodbye 
 Baby, is there anything left to tell? 
 I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head 
 Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead 
 Baby, what more can I tell? 
 Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed 
 Pray that I don't die of thirst 
 Baby, two feet from the well"
262,Bob Dylan,rock,Let's Stick Together,"Well, a young marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred 
 The man put us together, now, you wanna make it 
 Stick together 
 Come on, come on, stick together. 
 You know, you made a vow, not to leave one another, never 
 Well, ya never miss you water till your well runs dry 
 Come one, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together 
 Come on, come on, stick together 
 We made a vow, not to leave one another, never. 
 Well, ya never miss your water till your well runs dry 
 Come one, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together 
 Come on, come on, stick together 
 You know, we made a vow, not to leave one another, never. 
 It might be tough for a while, but consider the child 
 Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy 
 Let's stick together 
 Come on, come on, stick together 
 You know, we made a vow, not to leave one another, never."
263,Bob Dylan,rock,When Did You Leave Heaven,"When did you leave heaven? 
 How could they let you go? 
 How's every thing in heaven? 
 I'd like to know. 
 Why did you trade heaven? 
 For all these earthly things? 
 Where on earth you hide halo? 
 Where did you lose your wings? 
 Have they missed you? 
 Can you get back in? 
 If I kiss you would it be a sin? 
 I am only human but you are so divine. 
 When did you leave heaven angel mine?"
264,Bob Dylan,rock,Sally Sue Brown,"Look who's back in town 
 Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown 
 All you boys better run for cover 
 If you don't a-wanna be a hearted broken lover. 
 See her in that very tight skirt 
 Got what it takes 
 Just to make you hurt 
 Don't you see by those big bright eyes 
 Prefer to treat her nasty and low down lies. 
 Makes no difference where she's been 
 I'm go in south and doin' them things again 
 Bake in a hot tub, down the line 
 I'd rather see you ruin this a-heart of mine. 
 I'll go see them come down my way 
 Like a fool you're gonna hear me say: 
 ""I'll lay at your bed Sally Sue Brown 
 Please let me love you, baby 
 Don't put me down"".

265,Bob Dylan,rock,Death Is Not The End,"When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend 
 Just remember that death is not the end 
 And all that you've held sacred, falls down and does not mend 
 Just remember that death is no the end 
 Not the end, not the end 
 Just remember that death is not the end 
 When you're standing at the crossroads that you cannot comprehend 
 Just remember that death is not the end 
 And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend 
 Just remember that death is not the end 
 Not the end, not the end 
 Just remember that death is not the end 
 When the storm clouds gather 'round you, and heavy rains descend 
 Just remember that death is not the end 
 And there's no one there to comfort you, with a helpin' hand to lend 
 Just remember that death is not the end 
 Not the end, not the end 
 Just remember that death is not the end 
 Oh, the tree of life is growing 
 Where the spirit never dies 
 And the bright light of salvation shines 
 In dark and empty skies 
 When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men 
 Just remember that death is not the end 
 And you search in vain to find just one law abiding citizen 
 Just remember that death is not the end 
 Not the end, not the end 
 Just remember that death is not the end"

 It may be some place, baby, you say you where 
 I had a dream about you, baby 
 A dream about you, baby 
 Late last night you come a-rollin' across my mind. 
 You got the crazy rhythm when you walk 
 You make me nervous when you start to talk 
 I had a dream about you, baby 
 A dream about you, baby 
 Late last night you come a-rollin' across my mind. 
 Standin' on the highway, you flag me down 
 Said, take me, daddy, to the nearest town 
 I had a dream about you, baby 
 Had a dream about you, baby 
 Late last night you come a-rollin' across my mind. 
 The join is jumpin' it's really somethin' 
 The beat is pumpin, my heart is thumpin' 
 Spent my money on you honey 
 My limbs are shakin, my heart is breakin' 
 You kiss me, baby, in the coffee stop 
 You made me so bad, you gotta stop 
 I had a dream about you, baby 
 Had a dream about you, baby 
 Late last night you come a-rollin' across my mind. 
 The join is jumpin' it's really somethin' 
 The beat is pumpin, my heart is thumpin' 
 Spent my money on you honey 
 My limbs are shakin, my heart is breakin' 
 You had a white rag wrapped around your head 
 Wearing a long dress fire engine red 
 I had a dream about you, baby 
 Had a dream about you, baby 
 Late last night you come a-rollin' across my mind."

 There ain't nothing in the world that I wouldn't do 
 You know I love her yeah I love her 
 I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world 
 The woman that I love she's got two flat feet 
 Her knees knock together walking down the street 
 She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed 
 She ain't much to look at but like I said 
 I love her yeah I love her 
 I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world 
 (She's so ugly... gotta be ugly...) 
 I don't mean to say that she's got nothing done 
 She's got a weird sense of humor that's all her own 
 When I get low she sets me on my feet 
 Got a five inch smile but her breath is sweet 
 You know I love her (she's so ugly) 
 Yeah I love her (man she's ugly)

 Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold 
 Silvio I gotta go 
 Find out something only dead men know. 
 Honest as the next jade rolling that stone 
 When I come a-knockin' don't throw me no bone 
 I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home 
 If you don't like it you can leave me alone. 
 I can snap my fingers and require the rain 
 From a clear blue sky and turn it off again 
 I can stroke your body and relieve your pain 
 And charm the whistle off an evening train. 
 Silvio silver and gold 
 Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold 
 Silvio I gotta go 
 Find out something only dead men know 
 Give what I got until I got no more 
 I take what I get until I even the score 
 You know I love you and further more 
 When it is time to go you got an open door. 
 I can tell your fancy I can tell your plain 
 You give something up for everything you gain 
 Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain 
 Pay for your ticket and don't complain. 
 Silvio silver and gold 
 Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold 
 Silvio I gotta go 
 Find out something only dead men know. 
 One of these days and it won't be long 
 Going down in the valley and sing my song 
 I will sing it loud and sing it strong 
 Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong.

269,Bob Dylan,rock,Ninety Miles An Hour (Down A Dead End Street),"I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun 
 A few stolen kisses and no harm was done 
 Instead of stopping when we could we went right on 
 Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone. 
 You belong to someone else, and I do too 
 It's just crazy bein' here with you 
 As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat 
 Going ninety miles an hour down a dead end street 
 Ninety miles an hour down a dead end street. 
 I didn't want to want you, but now I have no choice 
 It's too late to listen to that warning voice 
 All I hear is thunder of two hearts beat 
 Going ninety miles an hour down a dead end street 
 Ninety miles an hour down a dead end street. 
 You're not free to belong to me 
 And you know I could never be your own 
 Your lips on mine are like a sweet, sweet wine 
 But we're heading for a wall of stone. 
 Warning signs are flashing ev'ry where, but we pay no heed 
 'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a pickin' up speed 
 Disaster's getting closer ev'ry time we meet 
 Going ninety miles an hour down a dead end street 
 Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead end street 
 Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead end street."

271,Bob Dylan,rock,Rank Strangers To Me,"Well, I wandered again to my home in the mountain 
 Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free 
 I looked for my friends but I never could find them 
 Ev'rybody I met was a rank stranger to me. 
 Ev'rybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger 
 No mother or dad, not a friend could I see 
 They knew not my name and I knew not their faces 
 Ev'rybody I met, rank strangers to me. 
 ""Well, they all moved away"", said the voice of a stranger 
 ""To some beautiful home on that bright, crystal sea"" 
 Some beautiful day, well, I'll meet 'em in heaven 
 Where no one will be a stranger to me. 
 Ev'rybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger 
 No mother or dad, not a friend could I see 
 They knew not my name and I knew not their faces 
 I found they were all rank strangers to me."
272,Bob Dylan,rock,Political World,"We live in a political world 
 Love don't have any place 
 We're living in times where men commit crimes 
 And crime don't have a face 
 We live in a political world 
 Icicles hanging down 
 Wedding bells ring and angels sing 
 And clouds cover up the ground 
 We live in a political world 
 Wisdom is thrown into jail 
 It rots in a cell, misguided as hell 
 Leaving no one to pick up a trail 
 We live in a political world 
 Where mercy walks the plank 
 Life is in mirrors, death disappears 
 Up the steps into the nearest bank 
 We live in a political world 
 Where courage is a thing of the past 
 Houses are haunted, children are unwanted 
 The next day could be your last 
 We live in a political world 
 The one we can see and can feel 
 But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck 
 We all know for sure that it's real 
 We live in a political world 
 The cities of a lonesome fear 
 Little by little you turn in the middle 
 But you're never sure why you're here 
 We live in a political world 
 Under the microscope 
 You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there 
 You always got more than enough rope 
 We live in a political world 
 Turning and a'thrashing about 
 As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take 
 What looks like the easy way out 
 We live in a political world 
 Where peace is not welcome at all 
 It's turned away from the door to wander some more 
 Or put up against the wall 
 We live in a political world 
 Everything is hers or his 
 Climb into the frame and shout God's name 
 But you're never sure what it is"
273,Bob Dylan,rock,Where Teardrops Fall,"Far away where the soft winds blow, 
 Far away from it all, 
 There is a place you go 
 Where teardrops fall. 
 Far away in the stormy night, 
 Far away and over the wall, 
 You are there in the flickering light 
 Where teardrops fall. 
 We banged the drum slowly 
 And played the fife lowly 
 You know the song in my heart 
 Bridge: In the turning of twilight 
 In the shadows of moonlight 
 You can show me a new place to start 
 I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup 
 Strippin' away at it all, 
 Thinking of you when the sun comes up 
 Where teardrops fall. 
 By rivers of blindness, 
 In love and with kindness 
 We could hold up a toast if we meet 
 Bridge: To the cuttin' of fences 
 To sharpen the senses 
 That linger in the fireball heat. 
 Roses are red, violets are blue 
 And time is beginning to crawl, 
 I just might have to come see you 
 Where teardrops fall."
274,Bob Dylan,rock,Everything Is Broken,"Broken lines, broken strings 
 Broken threads, broken springs 
 Broken idols, broken heads 
 People sleeping in broken beds 
 Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking 
 Everything is broken 
 Broken bottles, broken plates 
 Broken switches, broken gates 
 Broken dishes, broken parts 
 Streets are filled with broken hearts 
 Broken words never meant to be spoken 
 Everything is broken 
 Seem like every time you stop and turn around 
 Something else just hit the ground 
 Broken cutters, broken saws 
 Broken buckles, broken laws 
 Broken bodies, broken bones 
 Broken voices on broken phones 
 Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking 
 Everything is broken 
 Every time you leave and go off someplace 
 Things fall to pieces in my face 
 Broken hands on broken ploughs 
 Broken treaties, broken vows 
 Broken pipes, broken tools 
 People bending broken rules 
 Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking 
 Everything is broken"
275,Bob Dylan,rock,Ring Them Bells,"Ring them bells, ye heathen 
 From the city that dreams, 
 Ring them bells from the sanctuaries 
 Cross the valleys and streams, 
 For they're deep and they're wide 
 And the world's on its side 
 And time is running backwards 
 And so is the bride. 
 Ring them bells St. Peter 
 Where the four winds blow, 
 Ring them bells with an iron hand 
 So the people will know. 
 Oh it's rush hour now 
 On the wheel and the plow 
 And the sun is going down 
 Upon the sacred cow. 
 Ring them bells Sweet Martha, 
 For the poor man's son, 
 Ring them bells so the world will know 
 That God is one. 
 Oh the shepherd is asleep 
 Where the willows weep 
 And the mountains are filled 
 With lost sheep. 
 Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf, 
 Ring them bells for all of us who are left, 
 Ring them bells for the chosen few 
 Who will judge the many when the game is through. 
 Ring them bells, for the time that flies, 
 For the child that cries 
 When innocence dies. 
 Ring them bells St. Catherine 
 From the top of the room, 
 Ring them from the fortress 
 For the lilies that bloom. 
 Oh the lines are long 
 And the fighting is strong 
 And they're breaking down the distance 
 Between right and wrong."
276,Bob Dylan,rock,Man In The Long Black Coat,"Crickets are chirping, the water is high 
 There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry 
 The window's wide open, African trees 
 Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze 
 Not a word of goodbye, not even a note 
 She gone with the man in the long black coat 
 Somebody seen him hanging around 
 At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town 
 He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask 
 If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask 
 Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote 
 There was dust on the man in the long black coat 
 Preacher was a talking, there's a sermon he gave 
 He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved 
 You cannot depend on it to be your guide 
 When it's you who must keep it satisfied 
 It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat 
 She gave her heart to the man in the long black coat 
 There are no mistakes in life some people say 
 It is true sometimes you can see it that way 
 But people don't live or die, people just float 
 She went with the man in the long black coat 
 There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June 
 Tree trunks uprooted, 'neath the high crescent moon 
 Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force 
 Somebody is out there beating the dead horse 
 She never said nothing there was nothing she wrote 
 She gone with the man in the long black coat"
277,Bob Dylan,rock,Most Of The Time,"Most of the time, I'm clear focused all around 
 Most of the time, I can keep both feet on the ground 
 I can follow the path, I can read the signs 
 Stay right with it when the road unwinds 
 I can handle whatever I stumble upon 
 I don't even notice she's gone 
 Most of the time 
 Most of the time, it's well understood 
 Most of the time, I wouldn't change it if I could 
 I can't make it all match up, I can hold my own 
 I can deal with the situation right down to the bone 
 I can survive, I can endure 
 And I don't even think about her 
 Most of the time 
 Most of the time, my head is on straight 
 Most of the time, I'm strong enough not to hate 
 I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick 
 I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick 
 I can smile in the face of mankind 
 Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine 
 Most of the time 
 Most of the time, she ain't even in my mind 
 I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind 
 Most of the time, I can't even be sure 
 If she was ever with me or if I was with her 
 Most of the time, I'm halfway content 
 Most of the time, I know exactly where it all went 
 I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide 
 Hide from the feelings, that are buried inside 
 I don't compromise and I don't pretend 
 I don't even care if I ever see her again 
 Most of the time"
278,Bob Dylan,rock,What Good Am I?,"What good am I if I'm like all the rest 
 If I just turned away, when I see how you're dressed 
 If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry 
 What good am I? 
 What good am I if I know and don't do 
 If I see and don't say, if I look right through you 
 If I turn a deaf ear to the thunderin' sky 
 What good am I? 
 What good am I while you softly weep 
 And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep 
 And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try 
 What good am I? 
 What good am I then to others and me 
 If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see 
 If my hands tied must I not wonder within 
 Who tied them and why and where must I have been 
 What good am I if I say foolish things 
 And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings 
 And I just turn my back while you silently die 
 What good am I?"
279,Bob Dylan,rock,Disease Of Conceit,"There's a whole lot of people suffering tonight 
 From the disease of conceit 
 Whole lot of people struggling tonight 
 From the disease of conceit 
 Come right down the highway 
 Straight down the line 
 Rips into your senses 
 Through your body and your mind 
 Nothing about it that's sweet 
 The disease of conceit 
 There's a whole lot of hearts breaking tonight 
 From the disease of conceit 
 Whole lot of hearts shaking tonight 
 From the disease of conceit 
 Steps into your room 
 Eats at your soul 
 Over your senses 
 You have no control 
 Ain't nothing too discreet 
 About of disease of conceit 
 There's a whole lot of people dying tonight 
 From the disease of conceit 
 Whole lot of people crying tonight 
 From the disease of conceit 
 Comes right out of nowhere 
 And you're down for the count 
 From the outside world 
 The pressure will mount 
 Turn you into a piece of meat 
 The disease of conceit 
 Conceit is a disease 
 That the doctors got no cure 
 They've done a lot of research on it 
 But what it is, they're still not sure 
 There's a whole lot of people in trouble tonight 
 From the disease of conceit 
 Whole lot of people seeing double tonight 
 From the disease of conceit 
 Give ya delusions of grandeur 
 And an evil eye 
 Give you idea that 
 You're too good to die 
 And they bury you from your head to your feet 
 From the disease of conceit"
280,Bob Dylan,rock,What Was It You Wanted,"What was it you wanted? 
 Tell me again so I'll know. 
 What's happening in there, 
 What's going on in your show. 
 What was it you wanted, 
 Could you say it again? 
 I'll be back in a minute 
 You can get it together by then. 
 What was it you wanted 
 You can tell me, I'm back, 
 We can start it all over 
 Get it back on the track, 
 You got my attention, 
 Go ahead, speak. 
 What was it you wanted 
 When you were kissing my cheek? 
 Was there somebody looking 
 When you give me that kiss 
 Someone there in the shadows 
 Someone that I might have missed? 
 Is there something you needed, 
 Something I don't understand. 
 What was it you wanted, 
 Do I have it here in my hand? 
 Whatever you wanted 
 Slipped out of my mind, 
 Would you remind me again 
 If you'd be so kind. 
 Has the record been breaking, 
 Did the needle just skip, 
 Is there somebody waitin', 
 Was there a slip of the lip? 
 What was it you wanted 
 I ain't keepin' score 
 Are you the same person 
 That was here before? 
 Is it something important? 
 Maybe not. 
 What was it you wanted? 
 Tell me again I forgot. 
 Whatever you wanted 
 What could it be 
 Did somebody tell you 
 That you could get it from me, 
 Is it something that comes natural 
 Is it easy to say, 
 Why do you want it, 
 Who are you anyway? 
 Is the scenery changing, 
 Am I getting it wrong, 
 Is the whole thing going backwards, 
 Are they playing our song? 
 Where were you when it started 
 Do you want it for free 
 What was it you wanted 
 Are you talking to me?"
281,Bob Dylan,rock,Shooting Star,"Seen a shootin' star tonight 
 And I thought of you 
 You're tryin' to break into another world 
 A world I never knew 
 I always kinda wondered 
 If you ever made it through 
 Seen a shootin' star tonight 
 And I thought of you 
 Seen a shootin' star tonight 
 And I thought of me 
 If I was still the same 
 If I ever became 
 What you wanted me to be 
 Did I miss the mark 
 Overstep the line 
 That only you could see 
 Seen a shootin' star tonight 
 And I thought of me 
 Listen for the engine 
 Listen fir the bell 
 As the last fire-truck from hell 
 Goes rollin' by 
 All good people are prayin' 
 It's the last temptation 
 The last account 
 Last time you might hear 
 The sermon on the mount 
 Last Radio is playin' 
 Seen a shootin' star tonight 
 Slip away 
 Tomorrow will be 
 Another day 
 Guess it's too late to say the things to you 
 You needed to hear me say 
 Seen a shootin' star tonight 
 Slip away"
282,Bob Dylan,rock,Wiggle Wiggle,"Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen 
 Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, all dressed in green 
 Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue 
 Wiggle till the moon sees you 
 Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes 
 Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose 
 Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, like a swarm of bees 
 Wiggle on your hands and knees 
 Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear 
 Wiggle till you wiggle right out of here 
 Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts 
 Wiggle till it bites, wiggle till it cuts 
 Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup 
 Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop 
 Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead 
 Wiggle, you can raise the dead 
 Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher 
 Wiggle till you vomit fire 
 Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums 
 Wiggle till it answers, wiggle till it comes

 Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake 
 Wiggle like a big fat snake"
283,Bob Dylan,rock,Under The Red Sky,"There was a little boy and there was a little girl 
 And they lived in an alley under the red sky. 
 There was a little boy and there was a little girl 
 And they lived in an alley under the red sky. 
 There was an old man and he lived in the moon, 
 One summer's day he came passing by. 
 There was an old man and he lived in the moon, 
 And one day he came passing by. 
 Someday little girl, everything for you is gonna be new 
 Someday little girl you'll have a diamond as big as your shoe 
 Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high. 
 One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie. 
 Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high. 
 One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie. 
 This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town 
 This is the blind horse that leads you around 
 Let the bird sing, let the bird fly, 
 One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry. 
 Let the bird sing, let the bird fly, 
 The man in the moon went home and the river went dry."
284,Bob Dylan,rock,Unbelievable,"It's unbelievable, it's strange but true, 
 It's inconceivable it could happen to you. 
 You go north and you go south 
 Just like bait in the fish's mouth. 
 Ya must be livin' in the shadow of some kind of evil star. 
 It's unbelievable it would get this far. 
 It's undeniable what they'd have you to think, 
 It's indescribable it can drive you to drink. 
 They said it was the land of milk and honey, 
 Now they say it's the land of money. 
 Who ever thought they could ever make that stick. 
 It's unbelievable you can get this quick. 
 Every head is so dignified, every moon is so sanctified, 
 Every urge is so satisfied as long as you're with me. 
 All the silver, all the gold, all the sweethearts you can hold 
 That don't come back with stories untold, are hanging on a tree. 
 It's unbelievable like a lead balloon, 
 It's so impossible to even learn the tune. 
 Kill that beast and feed that swine, 
 Scale that wall and smoke that vine, 
 Feed that horse and saddle up the drum. 
 It's unbelievable, the day would finally come. 
 Once there was a man who had no eyes, 
 Every lady in the land told him lies, 
 He stood beneath the silver skies 
 And his heart began to bleed. 
 Every brain is civilized, 
 Every nerve is analyzed, 
 Everything is criticized when you are in need. 
 It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free, 
 So interchangeable, so delightful to see. 
 Turn your back, wash your hands, 
 There's always someone who understands 
 It don't matter no more what you got to say 
 It's unbelievable it would go down this way."
285,Bob Dylan,rock,Born In Time,"In the lonely night 
 In the blinking stardust of a pale blue light 
 You're comin' through to me in black and white 
 When we were made of dreams. 
 You're blowing down the shaky street, 
 You're hearing my heart beat 
 In the record breaking heat 
 Where we were born in time. 
 Not one more night, not one more kiss, 
 Not this time baby, no more of this, 
 Takes too much skill, takes too much will, 
 It's revealing. 
 You came, you saw, just like the law 
 You married young, just like your ma, 
 You tried and tried, you made me slide 
 You left me reelin' with this feelin'. 
 On the rising curve 
 Where the ways of nature will test every nerve, 
 You won't get anything you don't deserve 
 Where we were born in time. 
 You pressed me once, you pressed me twice, 
 You hang the flame, you'll pay the price, 
 Oh babe, that fire 
 Is still smokin'. 
 You were snow, you were rain 
 You were striped, you were plain, 
 Oh babe, truer words 
 Have not been spoken or broken. 
 In the hills of mystery, 
 In the foggy web of destiny, 
 You can have what's left of me, 
 Where we were born in time."
286,Bob Dylan,rock,T.V. Talkin' Song,"One time in London I'd gone out for a walk, 
 Past a place called Hyde park where people talk 
 'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view 
 To anyone passing by, that's who they're talking to. 
 There was someone on a platform talking to the folks 
 About the TV god and all the pain that it invokes. 
 ""It's too bright a light"", he said, ""For anybody's eyes, 
 If you've never seen one it's a blessing in disguise."" 
 I moved in closer, got up on my toes, 
 Two men in front of me were coming to blows 
 The man was saying something 'bout children when they're young 
 Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung. 
 ""The news of the day is on all the time, 
 All the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme, 
 Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free, 
 Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."" 
 ""Pray for peace!"". he said, you could feel it in the crowd. 
 My thoughts began to wander. His voice was ringing loud, 
 ""It will destroy your family, your happy home is gone 
 No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."" 
 ""It will led you into some strange pursuits, 
 Lead you to the land of forbidden fruits. 
 It will scramble up your head and drag your brain about, 
 Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."" 
 ""It's all been designed"", he said, ""To make you lose your mind, 
 And when you go back to find it, there's nothing there to find."" 
 ""Everytime you look at it, your situation's worse, 
 If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."" 
 The crowd began to riot and they grabbed hold of the man, 
 There was pushing, there was shoving and everybody ran. 
 The TV crew was there to film it, they jumped right over me, 
 Later on that evening, I watched it on TV"

 Drummin' in the morning, in the evening they'll be coming for you. 
 Ten thousand men on the move, 
 Ten thousand men on the move, 
 None of them doing nothin' that your mama wouldn't disapprove. 
 Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold, 
 Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold, 
 All clean shaven, all coming in from the cold. 
 Hey! who could your lover be? 
 Hey! who could your lover be? 
 Let me eat off his head so you can really see! 
 Ten thousand women all dressed in white, 
 Ten thousand women all dressed in white, 
 Standin' at my window wishing me goodnight. 
 Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail, 
 Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail, 
 Each one of 'em got seven wives, each one of 'em just out of jail. 
 Ten thousand women all sweepin' my room, 
 Ten thousand women all sweepin' my room, 
 Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up will a broom. 
 Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea! 
 Baby, thank you for my tea! 
 It's so sweet of you to be so nice to me."
288,Bob Dylan,rock,2 X 2,"One by one, they followed the sun, 
 One by one, until there were none. 
 Two by two, to their lovers they flew, 
 Two by two, into the foggy dew. 
 Three by three, they danced on the sea, 
 Four by four, they danced on the shore, 
 Five by five, they tried to survive, 
 Six by six, they were playing with tricks. 
 How many paths did they try and fail? 
 How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail? 
 How much poison did they inhale? 
 How many black cats crossed their trail? 
 Seven by seven, they headed for heaven, 
 Eight by eight, they got to the gate, 
 Nine by nine, they drank the wine, 
 Ten by ten, they drank again. 
 How many tomorrow's have are they given away? 
 How many compared to yesterday? 
 How many more without any reward? 
 How many more can they afford? 
 Two by two, they stepped into the ark, 
 Two by two, they step in the dark. 
 Three by three, they're turning the key, 
 Four by four, they turn it some more, 
 One by one, they follow the sun, 
 Two by two, to another rendezvous."

 God knows it's a crime 
 God knows there's gonna be no more water 
 But fire next time 
 God don't call it treason 
 God don't call it wrong 
 It was supposed to last a season 
 But it's been so strong for so long 
 God knows it's fragile 
 God knows everything 
 God knows it could snap apart right now 
 Just like putting scissors to a string 
 God knows it's terrifying 
 God sees it all unfold 
 There's a million reasons for you to be crying 
 You been so bold and so cold 
 God knows that when you see it 
 God knows you've got to weep 
 God knows the secrets of your heart 
 He'll tell them to you when you're asleep 
 God knows there's a river 
 God knows how to make it flow 
 God knows you ain't gonna be taking 
 Nothing with you when you go 
 God knows there's a purpose 
 God knows there's a chance 
 God knows you can rise above the darkest hour 
 Of any circumstance 
 God knows there's a heaven 
 God knows it's outta sight 
 God knows we can get all the way from here to there 
 If we've got to walk a million miles by candlelight

 She ain't hearing a thing, the silence is a-stickin' her deep. 
 The cat's in the well and grief is showing its face 
 The world's being slaughtered and it's such a bloody disgrace.

 And hear me tell my tale 
 How across the sea from England 
 I was condemned to sail 
 Now the jury found me guilty 
 Then says the judge, says he 
 ""Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you 
 Across the stormy sea 
 But take a tip before you ship 
 To join the iron gang 
 Don't get too gay in Botany Bay 
 Or else you'll surely hang 
 Or else you'll surely hang,"" says he 
 ""And after that, Jim Jones 
 It's high above on the gallows tree 
 The crows will pick your bones."" 
 And our ship was high upon the sea 
 Then pirates came along 
 But the soldiers on our convict ship 
 Were full five hundred strong 
 For they opened fire and somehow drove 
 That pirate ship away 
 But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship 
 Than gone to Botany Bay 
 With the storms ragin' round us 
 And the winds a-blowin' gale 
 I'd rather have drowned in misery 
 Than gone to New South Wales 
 There's no time for mischief there they say 
 Remember that says they 
 Oh, they'll flog the potions out of you 
 Down there in Botany bay 
 Now it's day and night and the irons clang 
 And like poor galley slaves 
 We toil and toil, and when we die 
 Must fill dishonored graves 
 And it's by and by I'll slip my chains 
 Well, into the bush I'll go 
 And I'll join the bravest rankers there 
 Jack Donohue and co 
 And some dark night, when everything 
 Is silent in the town 
 I'll shoot those tyrants one and all 
 I'll gun the flogger down 
 Oh, I'll give the land a little shock 
 Remember what I say 
 And they'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones 
 In chains to Botany Bay"

 She's dressed in silks and satins now 
 She cuts a gallant show 
 Finest of the ladies 
 Down Canadee-i-o 
 Come, all you fair and tender girls 
 Wheresoever you may be 
 I'd have you to follow your own true love 
 Whene'er he goes to sea 
 For if the sailors prove false to you 
 Well, the captain, he might prove true 
 You'll see the honor I have gained 
 By the wearing of the blue"
296,Bob Dylan,rock,Sittin' On Top Of The World,"Was in the summer, 
 One early fall, 
 Just tryin' to find my 
 Little all and all 
 Now she's gone, 
 An' I don't worry. 
 Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world. 
 Was in the spring, 
 One summer's day. 
 Just when she left me, 
 She gone to stay. 
 Now she's gone. 
 An' I don't worry. 
 Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world. 
 Now don't come runnin' 
 Holdin' up your hand. 
 Can get me a woman 
 Quick as you can get a man. 
 Now she's gone. 
 An' I don't worry. 
 Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world. 
 Happen for days, 
 Didn't know your name. 
 Oh, why should I worry 
 Or crave you in vain? 
 Now she's gone. 
 An' I don't worry. 
 Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world. 
 Went to the station, 
 Down in the yard, 
 Gonna get me a freight train, 
 Work's done got hard. 
 Now she's gone. 
 An' I don't worry. 
 Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world. 
 The lonesome days, 
 They have gone by, 
 Why should I beg you? 
 You said good-bye. 
 Now she's gone. 
 An' I don't worry. 
 Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world."
297,Bob Dylan,rock,Little Maggie,"Oh, where is little Maggie 
 Over yonder she stands, 
 Rifle on her shoulder, 
 Six-shooter in her hand. 
 How can I ever stand it, 
 Just to see them two blue eyes, 
 Shinin' like some diamonds, 
 Like some diamonds in the sky. 
 Rather be in some lonely hollow 
 Where the sun don't ever shine, 
 Than to see you be another man's darling, 
 And to know that you'll never be mine. 
 Well, it's march me away to the station 
 With my suitcase in my hand, 
 Yes, march me away to the station, 
 I'm off to some far-distant land. 
 Sometimes I have a nickel, 
 And sometimes I have a dime, 
 Sometimes I have ten dollars, 
 Just to pay for little Maggie's wine. 
 Pretty flowers are made for blooming, 
 Pretty stars are made to shine, 
 Pretty girls are made for boy's love, 
 Little Maggie was made for mine. 
 Well, yonder stands little Maggie 
 With a dram glass in her hand, 
 She's a drinkin' down her troubles 
 Over courtin' some other man."
298,Bob Dylan,rock,Hard Times,"Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears 
 While we all sup sorrow with the poor 
 There's a song that will linger forever in our ears 
 Oh, hard times, come again no more 
 'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary 
 Hard times, hard times, come again no more 
 Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door 
 Oh, hard times, come again no more 
 While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay 
 There are frail forms fainting at the door 
 Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say 
 Oh, hard times, come again no more 
 'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary 
 Hard times, hard times, come again no more 
 Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door 
 Oh, hard times, come again no more 
 There's a pale drooping maiden who toils her life away 
 With a worn out heart, whose better days are o'er 
 Though her voice it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day 
 Oh, hard times, come again no more 
 'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary 
 Hard times, hard times, come again no more 
 Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door 
 Oh, hard times, come again no more 
 'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary 
 Hard times, hard times, come again no more 
 Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door 
 Oh, hard times, come again no more"
299,Bob Dylan,rock,Step It Up And Go,"Got a little girl, little and low 
 She used to love me but she don't no more 
 She gotta step it up and go-yeah, go 
 Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go 
 Got a little girl, she stays upstairs 
 Make a livin' by puttin' on airs 
 Gotta step it up and go-yeah, man

 Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go 
 Got a little girl, her name is ball 
 Give a little bit, she took it all 
 I said step it up and go-yeah, man 
 Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go 
 Me an' my baby walkin' down the street 
 Tellin' everybody 'bout the chief of police 
 Gotta step it up and go-yeah, go 
 Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go 
 Tell my woman I'll see her at home 
 Ain't no lovin' since she been gone 
 Gotta step it up and go-yeah, go 
 Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go 
 Well, I'll sing this verse, ain't gonna sing no more 
 Hear my gal call me and I got to go 
 Step it up and go-yeah, man 
 Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go"
300,Bob Dylan,rock,Tomorrow Night,"Tomorrow night, will you remember what you said to night? 
 Tomorrow night, will all the thrill be gone? 
 Tomorrow night, will it be just another memory 
 Or just another song, that's in my heart to linger on? 
 Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast 
 And you willingly surrender to me, but darling will it last? 
 Tomorrow night, will you be with me when the moon is bright? 
 Tomorrow night, will you say those lovely things you said tonight? 
 Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast 
 And you willingly surrender to me, but darling will it last? 
 Tomorrow night, will you be with me when the moon is bright? 
 Tomorrow night, will you say those lovely things you said tonight?"
301,Bob Dylan,rock,Arthur McBride,"Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride 
 As we went a-walkin' down by the seaside 
 Now mark what followed and what did betide 
 For it bein' on Christmas mornin' 
 Now, for recreation, we went on a tramp 
 And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp 
 And a little wee drummer intending to camp 
 For the day bein' pleasant and charmin' 
 ""Good morning, good morning,"" the Sergeant he cried 
 ""And the same to you, gentlemen,"" we did reply 
 Intending no harm but meant to pass by 
 For it bein' on Christmas mornin' 
 ""But"", says he, ""My fine fellows, if you will enlist 
 Ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist 
 And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust 
 And drink the king's health in the morning 
 ""For a soldier, he leads a very fine life 
 And he always is blessed with a charming young wife 
 And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife 
 And he always lives pleasant and charmin' 
 And a soldier, he always is decent and clean 
 In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen 
 While other poor fellows go dirty and mean 
 And sup on thin gruel in the morning."" 
 ""But,"" says Arthur, ""I wouldn't be proud of your clothes 
 For you've only the lend of them, as I suppose 
 But you dare not change them one night, for you know 
 If you do, you'll be flogged in the morning 
 And although that we're single and free 
 We take great delight in our own company 
 We have no desire strange places to see 
 Although that your offers are charming 
 ""And we have no desire to take your advance 
 All hazards and dangers we barter on chance 
 For you'd have no scruples but to send us to France 
 Where we would get shot without warning,"" 
 ""Oh no,"" says the Sergeant. ""I'll have no such chat 
 And neither will take it from snappy young brats 
 For if you insult me with one other word 
 I'll cut off your heads in the morning."" 
 And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs 
 And we scarce gave them time to draw their own blades 
 When a trusty shillelagh came over their heads 
 And bid them take that as fair warning 
 And their old rusty rapiers that hung by their sides 
 We flung them as far as we could in the tide 
 ""Now take them up, devils!"" cried Arthur McBride 
 ""And temper their edge in the mornin'!"" 
 And the little wee drummer, we flattened his bow 
 And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow 
 Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll 
 And bade it a tedious returning 
 And we havin' no money, paid them off in cracks 
 We paid no respect to their two bloody backs 
 And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks 
 And left them for dead in the morning 
 And so, to conclude and to finish disputes 
 We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits 
 For we were the lads who would give them hard clouts 
 And bid them look sharp in the mornin' 
 Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride 
 As we went a-walkin' down by the seaside 
 Now mark what followed and what did betide 
 For it bein' on Christmas mornin'"

303,Bob Dylan,rock,Diamond Joe,"Now There's a man you'll hear about 
 Most anywhere you go 
 And his holdings are in Texas 
 And his name is Diamond Joe 
 And he carries all his money 
 In a diamond-studded jar 
 He never took much trouble 
 With the process of the law 
 I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys 
 Did offer him my hand 
 He gave a string of horses 
 So old they could not stand 
 And I nearly starved to death, boys 
 He did mistreat me so 
 And I never saved a dollar 
 In the pay of Diamond Joe 
 Now his bread it was corn dodger 
 And his meat you couldn't chaw 
 Nearly drove me crazy 
 With the waggin' of his jaw 
 And the tellin' of his story 
 Mean to let you know 
 That there never was a rounder 
 That could lie like Diamond Joe 
 Now, I tried three times to quit him 
 But he did argue so 
 I'm still punchin' cattle 
 In the pay of Diamond Joe 
 And when I'm called up yonder 
 And it's my time to go 
 Give my blankets to my buddies 
 Give the fleas to Diamond Joe"

 For an instance hand touched hand 
 They said, ""Aye,"" and away they rode 
 That brave and devoted band 
 Straight was the track to the top of the hill 
 The rebels they shot and shelled 
 Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks 
 And guarded them as they fell 
 There soon came a horrible dying yell 
 From heights that they could not gain 
 And those whom doom and death had spared 
 Rode slowly back again 
 But among the dead that were left on the hill 
 Was the boy with the curly hair 
 The tall dark man who rode by his side 
 Lay dead beside him there 
 There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl 
 The words that her lover had said 
 Momma, you know, awaits the news 
 And she'll only know he's dead"

 ""This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine 
 There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine 
 Oh, would have this heart of mine 
 Now Jackie's gone sailing with trouble on his mind 
 To leave his native country and his darling girl behind 
 Oh, his darling girl behind 
 She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array 
 Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away 
 Oh, convey herself away 
 ""Before you step onboard, sir, your name I'd like to know."" 
 She smiled all in her countenance, said, ""They call me Jack-A-Roe 
 Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."" 
 ""Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small 
 Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball 
 Oh, to face the cannonball 
 ""I know my waist is slender and my fingers they are small 
 But they would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall 
 Oh, to see ten thousand fall."" 
 The war soon being over, they hunted all around 
 Among the dead and dying her darling love she found 
 Oh, her darling love she found 
 She picked him up all in her arms and carries him to town 
 And sent for her physician to quickly heal his wounds 
 Oh, to quickly heal his wounds 
 This couple, they got married, so well they did agree 
 This couple they got married, so why not you and me 
 Oh, so why not you and me"
314,Bob Dylan,rock,Lone Pilgrim,"I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay 
 And pensively stood by his tomb 
 When in a low whisper I heard something say: 
 How sweetly I sleep here alone 
 The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar 
 And gathering storms may arise 
 But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul 
 The tears are all wiped from my eyes 
 The call of my master compelled me from home 
 No kindred or relative nigh 
 I met the contagion and sank to the tomb 
 My soul flew to mansions on high 
 Go tell my companion and children most dear 
 To weep not for me now I'm gone 
 The same hand that led me through seas most severe 
 Has kindly assisted me home"
315,Bob Dylan,rock,Love Sick,"I'm walking through streets that are dead 
 Walking, walking with you in my head 
 My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired 
 And the clouds are weeping 
 Did I hear someone tell a lie? 
 Did I hear someone's distant cry? 
 I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile 
 While I was sleeping 
 I'm sick of love 
 But I'm in the thick of it 
 This kind of love 
 I'm so sick of it 
 I see, I see lovers in the meadow 
 I see, I see silhouettes in the window 
 I watch them till they're gone and they leave me hanging on 
 To a shadow 
 I'm sick of love 
 I hear the clock tick 
 This kind of love 
 I'm love sick 
 Sometimes the silence can be like the thunder 
 Sometimes I wanna take to the road and plunder 
 Could you ever be true? I think of you 
 And I wonder 
 I'm sick of love 
 I wish I'd never met you 
 I'm sick of love 
 I'm trying to forget you 
 Just don't know what to do 
 I'd give anything to 
 Be with you"
316,Bob Dylan,rock,Dirt Road Blues,"Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride 
 Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride 
 If I can't find my baby, I'm gonna run away and hide 
 Well, I been pacing around the room hoping maybe she'd come back 
 Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back 
 Well, I been praying for salvation, laying 'round in a one room country shack 
 Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed 
 Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed 
 Till there's nothing left to see, till the chains have been shattered and I've been freed 
 But I been lookin' at my shadow, I been watching the colors up above 
 Lookin' at my shadow, watching the colors up above 
 Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love 
 Gon' walk on down that dirt road till everything becomes the same 
 Gon' walk on down that dirt road till everything becomes the same 
 Gotta keep on walkin' till I hear her holler out my name"
317,Bob Dylan,rock,Standing In The Doorway,"I've been walking through the summer nights 
 The jukebox playing low 
 Yesterday everything was going too fast 
 Today it's moving too slow 
 I've got no place left to turn 
 I've got nothing left to burn 
 Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you 
 It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow 
 You left me standing in the doorway crying 
 I got nothing to go back to now 
 The light in this place is so bad 
 Making me sick in the head 
 All the laughter is just making me sad 
 The stars have turned cherry red 
 I'm strumming on my gay guitar 
 Smoking a cheap cigar 
 The ghost of my old love has not gone away 
 Don't looking like it will any time soon 
 You left me standing in the doorway crying 
 Under the midnight moon 
 Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't 
 But not tonight and it won't be here 
 There are things I could say, but I don't 
 I know the mercy of God must be near 
 I been riding a midnight train 
 Got ice water in my veins 
 I would be crazy if I took you back 
 It would go up against every rule 
 You left me standing in the doorway crying 
 Suffering like a fool 
 When the last rays of daylight go down 
 Buddy, you'll roll no more 
 I can hear the church bells ringing in the yard 
 I wonder who they're ringing for 
 I know I can't win 
 But my heart just won't give in 
 Last night I danced with a stranger 
 But she just reminded me you were the one 
 You left me standing in the doorway crying 
 In the dark land of the sun 
 I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry 
 And live my life on the square 
 And even if the flesh falls off of my face 
 I know someone will be there to care 
 It always means so much 
 Even the softest touch 
 I see nothing to be gained by any explanation 
 There's no words that need to be said 
 You left me standing in the doorway crying 
 Blues wrapped around my head"
318,Bob Dylan,rock,Million Miles,"You took a part of me that I really miss 
 I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this 
 You told yourself a lie, that's alright mama, I told myself one too 
 I'm trying to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you 
 You took the silver, you took the gold 
 You left me standing out in the cold 
 People ask about you, I didn't tell them everything I knew 
 Well I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you 
 I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep 
 Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep 
 Did so many things I never did intend to do 
 Well I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you 
 I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low 
 I need every bit of it for the places that I go 
 Sometimes I wonder just what it's all coming to 
 Well I'm tryin' to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you 
 Well I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink 
 Maybe in the next life I'll be able to hear myself think 
 Feel like talking to somebody but I just don't know who 
 Well, I try to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you 
 Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street 
 ""Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet"" 
 I said, 
 ""That's alright mama, you... you do what you gotta do"" 
 Well, I'm tryin' to get closer, I'm still a million miles from you 
 Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once 
 Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months 
 And I'll rock you too 
 I'm tryin' to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you 
 Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard 
 I'm sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word 
 I know plenty of people, put me up for a day or two 
 Yes, I'm tryin' to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you"
319,Bob Dylan,rock,Tryin' To Get To Heaven,"The air is getting hotter 
 There's a rumbling in the skies 
 I've been wading through the high muddy water 
 With the heat rising in my eyes 
 Every day your memory grows dimmer 
 It doesn't haunt me like it did before 
 I've been walking through the middle of nowhere 
 Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door 
 When I was in Missouri 
 They would not let me be 
 I had to leave there in a hurry 
 I only saw what they let me see 
 You broke a heart that loved you 
 Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore 
 I've been walking that lonesome valley 
 Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door 
 People on the platforms 
 Waiting for the trains 
 I can hear their hearts a-beatin' 
 Like pendulums swinging on chains 
 When you think that you've lost everything 
 You find out you can always lose a little more 
 I'm just going down the road feeling bad 
 Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door 
 I'm going down the river 
 Down to New Orleans 
 They tell me everything is gonna be all right 
 But I don't know what 
 ""all right"" 
 even means 
 I was riding in a buggy with Miss Mary Jane 
 Miss Mary Jane got a house in Baltimore 
 I been all around the world, boys 
 Now I'm tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door 
 Gotta sleep down in the parlor 
 And relive my dreams 
 I'll close my eyes and I wonder 
 If everything is as hollow as it seems 
 Some trains don't pull no gamblers 
 No midnight ramblers, like they did before 
 I been to Sugartown, I shook the sugar down 
 Now I'm tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door"
320,Bob Dylan,rock,'Til I Fell In Love With You,"Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense 
 I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against a fence 
 I've been hit too hard, seen too much 
 Nothing can heal me now but your touch 
 I just don't know what I'm gonna do 
 I was alright 'til I fell in love with you 
 Well, my house is on fire, burnin' to the sky 
 Well, I thought it would rain but the clouds passed by 
 And I feel like I'm comin' to the end of my way 
 But I know God is my shield and he won't lead me astray 
 Still, I don't know what I'm gonna do 
 I was alright 'til I fell in love with you 
 Boys in the street beginnin' to play 
 Girls like birds, flyin' away 
 When I'm gone you will remember my name 
 I'm gonna win my way to wealth and fame 
 Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do 
 I was alright 'til I fell in love with you 
 Well, junk's pilin' up, takin' up space 
 My eyes feel like they're falling off my face 
 Sweat pourin' down, I'm starin' at the floor 
 I'm thinkin' about that girl who won't be back no more 
 I just don't know what to do 
 I was alright 'til I fell in love with you 
 Well, I'm tired of talkin', I'm tired of tryin' to explain 
 My attemps to please ya, they were all in vain 
 Tomorrow night before the sun goes down 
 If I'm still among the living, I'll be Dixie bound 
 Still, I just don't know what I'm gonna do 
 I was alright 'til I fell in love with you"
321,Bob Dylan,rock,Not Dark Yet,"Shadows are falling and I've been here all day 
 It's too hot to sleep, time is running away 
 Feel like my soul has turned into steel 
 I've still got the scars that the sun didn't heal 
 There's not even room enough to be anywhere 
 It's not dark yet, but it's getting there 
 Well my sense of humanity has gone down the drain 
 Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kind of pain 
 She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind 
 She put down in writing what was in her mind 
 I just don't see why I should even care 
 It's not dark yet, but it's getting there 
 Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris 
 I've followed the river and I got to the sea 
 I've been down on the bottom of a whirlpool of lies 
 I ain't looking for nothin' in anyone's eyes 
 Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear 
 It's not dark yet, but it's getting there 
 I was born here and I'll die here against my will 
 I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still 
 Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb 
 I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from 
 Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer 
 It's not dark yet, but it's getting there"
322,Bob Dylan,rock,Cold Irons Bound,"I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around 
 Well, I'm all used up and the fields have turned brown 
 I went to church on Sunday and she passed by 
 My love for her is taking such a long time to die 
 I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist 
 It's almost like, almost like I don't exist 
 I'm twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound 
 The walls of pride are high and wide 
 Can't see over to the other side 
 It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay 
 It's sadder still to feel your heart torn away 
 One look at you and I'm out of control 
 Like the universe has swallowed me whole 
 I'm twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound 
 There's too many people, too many to recall 
 I thought some of 'em were friends of mine, I was wrong about 'em all 
 Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud 
 Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood 
 I found my world, found my world in you 
 But your love just hasn't proved true 
 I'm twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound 
 Twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound 
 Oh, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds 
 Reality has always had too many heads 
 Some things last longer than you think they will 
 Some kind of things you can never kill 
 'Cause it's you and you only I been thinking about 
 But you can't see in and it's hard lookin' out 
 I'm twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound 
 Well, the fats in the fire and the water's in the tank 
 Well, the whiskey's in the jar and the money's in the bank 
 I tried to love and protect you because I cared 
 I'm gonna remember forever the joy that we shared 
 Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee 
 You have no idea what you do to me 
 I'm twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound 
 Twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound"
323,Bob Dylan,rock,Make You Feel My Love,"When the rain is blowing in your face 
 And the whole world is on your case 
 I could offer you a warm embrace 
 To make you feel my love 
 When the evening shadows and the stars appear 
 And there is no one there to dry your tears 
 I could hold you for a million years 
 To make you feel my love 
 I know you haven't made your mind up yet 
 But I would never do you wrong 
 I've known it from the moment that we met 
 No doubt in my mind where you belong 
 I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue 
 I'd go crawling down the avenue 
 No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do 
 To make you feel my love 
 The storms are raging on the rollin' sea 
 And on the highway of regret 
 The winds of change are blowing wild and free 
 You ain't seen nothing like me yet 
 I could make you happy, make your dreams come true 
 Nothing that I wouldn't do 
 Go to the ends of the earth for you 
 To make you feel my love"
324,Bob Dylan,rock,Can't Wait,"I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind 
 It's late, I'm trying to walk the line 
 Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around 
 Some on their way up, some on their way down 
 The air burns and I'm trying to think straight 
 And I don't know how much longer I can wait 
 I'm your man, I'm trying to recover the sweet love that we knew 
 You understand that my heart can't go on beating without you 
 Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm reeling from the blow 
 I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so 
 I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate 
 But I don't know how much longer I can wait 
 Skies are grey, I'm looking for anything that will bring a happy glow 
 Night or day, it doesn't matter where I go anymore; I just go 
 If I ever saw you coming I don't know what I might do 
 I'd like to think I could control myself, but it isn't true 
 That's how it is when things disintegrate 
 And I don't know how much longer I can wait 
 I'm doomed to love you 
 I've been rolling through stormy weather 
 I'm thinking of you 
 And all the places we could roam together 
 It's mighty funny; the end of time has just begun 
 Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one 
 Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind 
 I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line 
 I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate 
 But I don't know how much longer I can wait"
325,Bob Dylan,rock,Highlands,"Well my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair 
 Honeysuckle blooming in the wildwood air 
 Bluebelles blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow 
 Well my heart's in the Highland 
 I'm gonna go there when I feel good enough to go 
 Windows were shakin' all night in my dreams 
 Everything was exactly the way that it seems 
 Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page 
 Same ol' rat race 
 Life in the same ol' cage 
 I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take 
 Wouldn't know the difference between a real blonde and a fake 
 Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery 
 I wish someone would come 
 And push back the clock for me 
 Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam 
 That's where I'll be when I get called home 
 The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme 
 Well my heart's in the Highland 
 I can only get there one step at a time 
 I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound 
 Someone's always yelling, 
 ""Turn it down!"" 
 Feel like I'm drifting 
 Drifting from scene the scene 
 I'm wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean? 
 Insanity is smashing up against my soul 
 You can say I was on anything but a roll 
 If I had a conscience, well I just might blow my top 
 What would I do with it anyway? 
 Maybe take it to the pawn shop 
 My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn 
 By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan 
 Big white clouds, like chariots that swing down low 
 Well my heart's in the Highlands 
 Only place left to go 
 I'm in Boston town, in some restaurant 
 I got no idea what I want 
 Well, maybe I do but I'm just really not sure 
 Waitress comes over 
 Nobody in the place but me and her 
 Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around 
 She studies me closely as I sit down 
 She got a pretty face and long white shiny legs 
 I say, 
 ""Tell me what I want."" 
 She say, 
 ""You probably want hard boiled eggs."" 
 I said, 
 ""That's right, bring me some."" 
 She says, 
 ""We ain't got any. You picked the wrong time to come"" 
 Then she says, 
 ""I know you're an artist, draw a picture of me!"" 
 I say, 
 ""I would if I could, but 
 I don't do sketches from memory."" 
 ""Well,"" 
 she says, ""I'm right here in front of you or haven't you looked?"" 
 I say, 
 ""All right, I know, but I don't have my drawing book!"" 
 She gives me a napkin, she says, 
 ""You can do it on that."" 
 I say, 
 ""Yes I could but 
 I don't know where my pencil is at!"" 
 She pulls one out from behind her ear 
 She says, 
 ""All right now, go ahead, draw me, I'm standing right here."" 
 I make a few lines, and I show it for her to see 
 Well she takes a napkin and throws it back 
 And says, 
 ""That don't look a thing like me!"" 
 I said, 
 ""Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."" 
 She say, 
 ""You must be jokin.'"" 
 I say, 
 ""I wish I was!"" 
 Then she says, 
 ""You don't read women authors, do you?"" 
 At least that's what I think I hear her say 
 Well I say, 
 ""How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"" 
 Well, she says, 
 ""You just don't seem like you do!"" 
 I said, 
 ""You're way wrong."" 
 She says, 
 ""Which ones have you read then?"" 
 I say, 
 ""I read Erica Jong!"" 
 She goes away for a minute and I slide out out of my chair 
 I step outside back to the busy street, but nobody's going anywhere 
 Well my heart's in the Highlands, with the horses and hounds 
 Way up in the border country, far from the towns 
 With the twang of the arrow and a snap of the bow 
 My heart's in the Highlands 
 Can't see any other way to go 
 Every day is the same thing out the door 
 Feel further away then ever before 
 Some things in life, it gets too late to learn 
 Well, I'm lost somewhere 
 I must have made a few bad turns 
 I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes 
 They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright colored clothes 
 All the young men with their young women looking so good 
 Well, I'd trade places with any of 'em 
 In a minute, if I could 
 I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog 
 Talking to myself in a monologue 
 I think what I need might be a full length leather coat 
 Somebody just asked me 
 If I'm registered to vote 
 The sun is beginning to shine on me 
 But it's not like the sun that used to be 
 The party's over and there's less and less to say 
 I got new eyes 
 Everything looks far away 
 Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day 
 Over the hills and far away 
 There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow 
 But I'm already there in my mind 
 And that's good enough for now"
326,Bob Dylan,rock,Tweedle Dee & Tweedle Dum,"Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee 
 They're throwing knives into the tree 
 Two big bags of dead man's bones 
 Got their noses to the grindstones 
 Living in the Land of Nod 
 Trustin' their fate to the hands of God 
 They pass by so silently 
 Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee 
 Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire 
 They're taking a streetcar named Desire 
 Looking in the window at the pecan pie 
 Lot of things they'd like they would never buy 
 Neither one gonna turn and run 
 They're making a voyage to the sun 
 ""His Master's voice is calling me,"" 
 Says Tweedle-dee Dum to Tweedle-dee Dee 
 Tweedle-dee Dee and Tweedle-dee Dum 
 All that and more and then some 
 They walk among the stately trees 
 They know the secrets of the breeze 
 Tweedle-dee Dum said to Tweedle-dee Dee 
 ""Your presence is obnoxious to me."" 
 They're like babies sittin' on a woman's knee 
 Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee 
 Well, the rain beating down on my window pane 
 I got love for you and it's all in vain 
 Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil 
 They're dripping with garlic and olive oil 
 Tweedle-dee Dee, he's on his hands and his knees 
 Saying, 
 ""Throw me somethin', Mister, please."" 
 ""What's good for you is good for me,"" 
 Says Tweedle-dee Dum to Tweedle-dee Dee 
 Well, they're living in a happy harmony 
 Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee 
 They're one day older and a dollar short 
 They've got a parade permit and a police escort 
 They're lying low and they're makin' hay 
 They seem determined to go all the way 
 They run a brick and tile company 
 Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee 
 Well a childish dream is a deathless need 
 And a noble truth is a sacred creed 
 My pretty baby, she's lookin' around 
 She's wearin' a multi-thousand dollar gown 
 Tweedle-dee Dee is a lowdown, sorry old man 
 Tweedle-dee Dum, he'll stab you where you stand 
 ""I've had too much of your company,"" 
 Says, Tweedle-dee Dum to Tweedle-dee Dee"
327,Bob Dylan,rock,Mississippi,"Every step of the way, we walk the line 
 Your days are numbered, so are mine 
 Time is piling up, we struggle and we stray 
 We're all boxed in, nowhere to escape 
 City's just a jungle, more games to play 
 Trapped in the heart of it, tryin' to get away 
 I was raised in the country, I been working in the town 
 I been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down 
 Got nothing for you, I had nothing before 
 Don't even have anything for myself anymore 
 Sky full of fire, pain pouring down 
 Nothing you can sell me, I'll see you around 
 All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime 
 Could never do you justice in reason or rhyme 
 Only one thing I did wrong 
 Stayed in Mississippi a day too long 
 Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall 
 Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all 
 I was thinking about the things that Rosie said 
 I was dreaming I was sleeping in Rosie's bed 
 Walking through the leaves, falling from the trees 
 Feeling like a stranger nobody sees 
 So many things that we never will undo 
 I know you're sorry, I'm sorry too 
 Some people will offer you their hand and some won't 
 Last night I knew you, tonight I don't 
 I need something strong to distract my mind 
 I'm gonna look at you till my eyes go blind 
 Well I got here following the southern star 
 I crossed that river just to be where you are 
 Only one thing I did wrong 
 Stayed in Mississippi a day too long 
 Well my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast 
 I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past 
 But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free 
 I've got nothing but affection for all those who sailed with me 
 Everybody's moving, if they ain't already there 
 Everybody got to move somewhere 
 Stick with me baby, stick with me anyhow 
 Things should start to get interesting right about now 
 My clothes are wet, tight on my skin 
 Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in 
 I know that fortune is waiting to be kind 
 So give me your hand and say you'll be mine 
 Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay 
 You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way 
 Only one thing I did wrong 
 Stayed in Mississippi a day too long"
328,Bob Dylan,rock,Summer Days,"Summer days, summer nights are gone 
 Summer days and summer nights are gone 
 I know a place where there's still somethin' going on 
 I've got a house on the hill, I got hogs out in the mud 
 I've got a house on the hill, I got hogs all out in the mud 
 I've got a long-haired woman, she got royal Indian blood 
 Everybody get ready, lift up your glasses and sing 
 Everybody get ready, lift up your glasses and sing 
 Well I'm standin' on the table, I'm proposin' a toast to the king 
 I'm driving in the flats in a Cadillac car 
 The girls all say ""You're a worn out star"" 
 My pockets are loaded and I'm spending every dime 
 How can you say you love someone else, you know it's me all the time 
 Well the fog's so thick you can't spy the land 
 Well the fog's so thick that you can't even spy the land 
 What good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman? 
 Weddin' bells are ringin' and the choir is beginning to sing 
 Yes, the weddin' bells are ringin' and the choir's beginning to sing 
 What looks good in the day, at night is another thing 
 She's looking in to my eyes and she's a-holding my hand 
 She looks in to my eyes, she's holding my hand 
 She say, 
 ""You can't repeat the past,"" 
 I say 
 ""You can't? What do you mean you can't? Of course you can."" 
 Where do you come from, where do you go? 
 Sorry, that is nothing you would need to know 
 Well, my back's been to the wall so long it seems like it's stuck 
 Why don't you break my heart one more time, just for good luck 
 I got eight carburators and boys I'm usin' 'em all

 If you got something to say, speak or hold your peace 
 Well, if you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace 
 If it's information you want, you can get it from the police 
 Politician's got on his joggin' shoes 
 He must be runnin' for office, got no time to lose 
 Suckin' the blood out of the genius of generosity 
 You been rollin' your eyes, you been teasin' me 
 Standin' by God's river, my soul's beginning to shake 
 Standin' by God's river, my soul's beginning to shake 
 I'm countin' on you, love, to gimme a break 
 Well, I'm leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift 
 Yes, I'm leaving in the morning, just as soon as the dark clouds lift 
 I'm breakin' the roof, set fire to the place as a partin' gift 
 Summer days, summer nights are gone 
 Summer days, summer nights are gone 
 I know a place where there's still something goin' on"
329,Bob Dylan,rock,Bye And Bye,"Bye and bye, I'm breathin' a lover's sigh 
 While I'm sittin' on my watch so I can be on time 
 I'm singin' love's praises with sugar coated rhyme 
 Bye and bye, on you I'm castin' my eye 
 I'm paintin' the town, swingin' my partner around 
 Well I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust 
 I'm watchin' the road, I'm studyin' the dust 
 I'm paintin' the town, makin' my last go-round 
 Well I'm scufflin' and I'm shufflin' and I'm walkin' on briars 
 I'm not even aquainted with my own desires 
 I'm rollin' slow, I'm doin' all I know 
 I'm tellin' myself I've found true happiness 
 That I still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed 
 I'm rollin' slow goin' where the wild roses grow 
 Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past 
 You were my first love and you will be my last 
 Papa gone mad, Mama she's feelin' sad 
 Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more 
 I wanna establish my rule through civil war 
 Gonna make you see just how loyal and true a man can be"

 Yeah, today has been a sad and lonesome day

 Well, they're doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor

 When I left my longtime darling, she was standing in the door 
 Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war

 Samantha Brown lived in my house for 'bout four or five months

 Don't know how it looked to other people, I never slept with her even once

 Funny, the things you have the hardest time parting with are the things you need the least 
 Well, I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive 
 I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive 
 Set my dial on the radio I wish my mother was still alive 
 I seen your lover man comin', comin' across the barren fields 
 I see your lover man comin', comin' 'cross the barren fields 
 He not a gentleman at all, he's rotten to the core, he's a coward and he steals 
 Well my captain, he's decorated, he's well-schooled and he's skilled 
 My captain, he's decorated, he's well-schooled and he's skilled 
 He's not sentimental, don't bother him at all; how many of his pals have been killed 
 Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying to make out what it was 
 Last night the wind was whispering something, I was trying to make out what it was 
 Yeah I tell myself something's coming, but it never does 
 I'm going to spare the defeated, I'm going to speak to the crowd 
 I'm going to spare the defeated, 'cause I'm going to speak to the crowd 
 I'm going to teach peace to the conquered, I'm going to tame the proud 
 Well, the leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off of the shelf 
 Leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off the shelf 
 You're gonna need my help sweetheart, you can't make love all by yourself"
331,Bob Dylan,rock,Floater (Too Much To Ask),"Down over the window 
 From the dazzling sunlit place 
 Through the back alleys, through the blinds 
 Another one of the Memphis days 
 Honey bees are buzzing 
 Leaves begin to stir 
 I'm in love with my second cousin 
 I tell myself I could be happy forever with her 
 I keep listening for footsteps 
 But I ain't never hearing any 
 From the boat, I fish for bullheads 
 I catch a lot, sometimes too many 
 A summer breeze is blowin' 
 A squall is setting in 
 Sometimes it's just plain stupid 
 To get into any kind of wind 
 Well the old men 'round here sometimes 
 They get on bad terms with the younger men 
 Old, young, age don't carry weight 
 It doesn't matter in the end 
 One of the boss' hangers-on 
 Sometimes comes to call 
 At times you least expect 
 Tryin' to bully you, strongarm you, inspire you with fear 
 It has the opposite effect 
 There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town 
 The other one is long gone 
 10 foot, 2 foot, 6 across 
 Burns with the bark still on 
 They say times are hard 
 If you don't believe it you can follow your nose 
 It don't bother me, times are hard everywhere 
 We'll just have to see how it goes 
 My old man, he's like some feudal lord 
 He's got more lives than a cat 
 I've never seen him quarrel with my mother even once 
 Things come alive or they fall flat 
 You can smell the pine wood burnin' 
 You can hear the school bell ring 
 Got to get up near the teacher, if you can 
 If you wanna learn anything 
 Romeo, he said to Juliet, 
 ""You got a poor complexion 
 That don't give your appearance a very youthful touch."" 
 Juliet said back to Romeo 
 ""Why don't you just shove off if it bothers you so much."" 
 They all got outta here any way they could 
 Cold rain can give you the shivers 
 They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee 
 All the rest of them rebel rivers 
 If you ever try to interfere with me or cross my path again 
 You do so at the peril of your life 
 I'm not quite as cool, or forgiving as I sound 
 I've seen enough heartache and strife 
 My grandfather was a duck trapper 
 He could do it with just dragnets and ropes 
 My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth 
 I don't know if they had any dreams or hopes 
 I had 'em once, though I suppose 
 To go along with all the ring dancing 
 Christmas carols on all the Christmas eves 
 I left all my dreams and hopes 
 Buried under tobacco leaves 
 Not always easy kicking someone out 
 Got to wait awhile, it can be an unpleasant task 
 Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up 
 And tears or not, it's too much to ask"

 Risin' night and day 
 All the gold and silver 
 Are being stolen away

 From the dark room of his mind 
 He made it to Kansas City 
 Twelfth Street and Vine 
 Nothing standing there 
 High water everywhere 
 High water risin' 
 The shacks are slidin' down 
 Folks lose their possessions 
 Folks are leaving town 
 Bertha Mason shook it, broke it 
 Then she hung it on a wall 
 Says, 
 ""You're dancin' with whom they tell you to 
 Or you don't dance at all."" 
 It's tough out there 
 High water everywhere 
 I got a cravin' love for blazing speed 
 Got a hopped up Mustang Ford 
 Jump into the wagon, love 
 Throw your panties overboard 
 I can write you poems 
 Make a strong man lose his mind 
 I'm no pig without a wig 
 I hope you treat me kind 
 Things are breakin' up out there 
 High water everywhere 
 High water risin' 
 Six inches 'bove my head

 I asked Fat Nancy for something to eat 
 She said, ""Take it off the shelf. 
 As great as you are, man 
 You'll never be greater than yourself."" 
 I told her I didn't really care 
 High water everywhere 
 I'm getting' up in the morning 
 I believe I'll dust my broom 
 Keeping away from the women 
 I'm givin' 'em lots of room 
 Thunder rolling over Clarksdale 
 Everything is looking blue 
 I just can't be happy, love 
 Unless you're happy too 
 It's bad out there 
 High water everywhere"
333,Bob Dylan,rock,Moonlight,"The seasons they are turning 
 And my sad heart is yearning 
 To hear again the songbird's sweet melodious tone 
 Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone? 
 The dusky light the day is losing 
 Orchids, poppies, black eyed susan 
 The earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone 
 Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone? 
 The air is thick and heavy 
 All along the levee 
 Where the geese into the countryside have flown 
 Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone? 
 Well, I'm preaching peace and harmony 
 The blessings of tranquility 
 Yet I know when the time is right to strike 
 I take you 'cross the river, dear 
 You've no need to linger here 
 I know the kinds of things you like 
 The clouds are turning crimson 
 The leaves fall from the limbs and 
 The branches cast their shadows over stone 
 Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone? 
 The boulevards of cypress trees 
 The masquerade of birds and bees 
 The petals pink and white, the wind has blown 
 Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone? 
 The trailing moss in mystic glow 
 The purple blossom, soft as snow 
 My tears keep flowing to the sea 
 Doctor, lawyer, indian chief 
 It takes a thief to catch a thief 
 For whom does the bell toll for, love? 
 It tolls for you and me 
 Old pulse's running through my palm 
 The sharp hills are rising from 
 Yellow fields with twisted oaks that grow 
 Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?"
334,Bob Dylan,rock,Honest With Me,"Well, I'm stranded in the city that never sleeps 
 Some of these women they just give me the creeps 
 I'm avoidin' the south side the best I can 
 These memories I got, they can strangle a man 
 Well, I came ashore in the dead of the night 
 Lot of things can get in the way when you're tryin' to do what's right 
 You don't understand it, my feelin' for you 
 You'd be honest with me if you only knew 
 I'm not sorry for nothing I've done 
 I'm glad I fought, I only wish we'd won 
 The Siamese twins are comin' to town 
 People can't wait, they've gathered around 
 When I left my home the sky split open wide 
 I never wanted to go back there, I'd rather have died 
 You don't understand it, my feelin' for you 
 You'd be honest with me if only you knew 
 My woman got a face like a teddy bear 
 She's tossin' a baseball bat in the air 
 The meat is so tough you can't cut it with a sword 
 I'm crashin' my car trunk first into the board 
 They say that my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice 
 Well, I'll sell it to ya at a reduced price 
 You don't understand it, my feeling for you 
 You'd be honest with me if only you knew 
 Some things are too terrible to be true 
 I won't come here no more if it's botherin' you 
 There's a Southern Pacific leaving at 9:45 
 I'm havin' a hard time, believin' some people would ever arrive 
 I'm stark naked but I don't care 
 I'm goin' off into the woods, I'm huntin' bear 
 You don't understand it, my feeling for you 
 Well, you'd be honest with me if only you knew 
 I'm here to create the new imperial empire 
 I'm gonna do whatever circumstances require 
 I care so much for you, didn't think I could 
 I can't tell my heart that you're no good 
 Well my parents, they warned me not to risk my years 
 And I still got their advice oozing out of my ears 
 You don't understand it, my feeling for you 
 Well, you'd be honest with me if only you knew"
335,Bob Dylan,rock,Po' Boy,"Man came to the door, I say 
 ""For whom were you lookin'?"" 
 Says 
 ""Your wife."" 
 I say, 
 ""She's busy in the kitchen cookin'."" 
 Po' boy, where you been? 
 Already told you, won't tell you again 
 I say, 
 ""How much you want for that? I'll go into the store."" 
 Man says, 
 ""Three dollars."" ""All right,"" 
 I say, 
 ""Will you take four?"" 
 Po' boy, never say die 
 Things will be all right, bye and bye 
 Workin' like in a main line, workin' like a devil 
 The game is the same it's just up on another level 
 Po' boy, dressed in black 
 Police at your back 
 Po' boy in a red hot town 
 Out beyond the twinklin' stars 
 Ridin' first class train, makin' the rounds 
 Try to keep from fallin' between the cars 
 Othello told Desdemona 
 ""I'm cold, cover me with a blanket"" 
 ""By the way, what happened to that poisoned wine?"" 
 She said, 
 ""I gave it to you. You drank it"" 
 Po' boy, layin' 'em straight 
 Pickin' up the cherries fallin' off the plate 
 Time and love has branded me with its claws 
 Had to go to Florida, dodgin' them Georgia laws 
 Po' boy in the hotel called the Palace of Gloom 
 Called down to room service, says, 
 ""Send up a room."" 
 My mother was the daughter of a wealthy farmer 
 My father was a traveling salesman, I never met him 
 When my mother died my uncle took me in, he run a funeral parlor 
 He did a lot of nice things for me and I won't forget him 
 All I know is that I'm thrilled by your kiss 
 I don't know any more than this 
 Po' boy, pickin' up sticks 
 Build you a house out of mortar and bricks 
 Knockin' on the door, I say, 
 ""Who is it, where you from?"" 
 Man say 
 ""Freddie"" 
 , I say 
 ""Freddie who?"" 
 He say, 
 ""Freddie or not, here I come.""

336,Bob Dylan,rock,Cry A While,"Well, I had to go down to see a guy named 
 Mr. Goldsmith 
 Nasty, dirty, double-crossin', back-stabbin' phony 
 I didn't want to have to deal with 
 But I did it for you 
 And all you gave me was a smile 
 Well, I cried for you 
 Now it's your turn to cry a while 
 I don't carry dead weight 
 I'm no flash in the pan 
 All right, I'll set you straight 
 Can't you see I'm a union man 
 I'm lettin' the cat out of the cage 
 I'm keepin' a low profile 
 Well, I cried for you 
 Now it's your turn, you can cry a while 
 Feel like a fightin' rooster 
 Feel better than I ever felt 
 But the Pennsylvania line's in an awful mess 
 And the Denver road is a-goin' to melt 
 I went to the church house 
 Every day I go an extra mile 
 Well, I cried for you 
 Now your turn, you can cry a while 
 Last night, 'cross the alley 
 There was a poundin' on the wall 
 It must have been Don Pasquale 
 Makin' a 2 a.m. booty call 
 To break a trusting heart like mine 
 Was just your style 
 Well, I cried for you 
 Now it's your turn to cry a while 
 I'm on the fringes of the night 
 Fighting back my tears that I can't control 
 Some people they ain't human 
 They got no heart or soul 
 But I'm a-cryin' to the Lord 
 Tryin' to be meek and mild 
 Yes, I've cried for you 
 Now it's your turn, you can cry a while 
 Well the preacher's in the pulpit 
 And the babies in their cribs 
 I'm longin' for that sweet fat 
 That sticks to your ribs 
 I'm goin' to buy me a barrel of whisky 
 I'll die before I turn senile 
 Yes, I've cried for you 
 Now it's your turn, you can cry a while 
 Well, you bet on the horses 
 And they ran the wrong way 
 I always said you'd be sorry 
 And today could be the day 
 I might need a good lawyer 
 Could be your funeral, my trial 
 Well, I cried for you 
 Now it's your turn, you can cry a while"

 I can see what everybody in the world is up against 
 Can't turn back, you can't come back, sometimes we push too far 
 One day you'll open up your eyes and you'll see where you are 
 Sugar baby get on down the road 
 You ain't got no brains nohow 
 You went years without me 
 Might as well keep goin' now 
 Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff 
 Plenty of places to hide things here if you want to hide them bad enough 
 I'm staying with Aunt Sally, but you know she not really my aunt 
 Some of these memories, you can learn to live with and some of'em you can't 
 Sugar baby get on down the line 
 You ain't got no brains nohow 
 You went years without me 
 Might as well keep goin' now 
 The ladies down in Darktown, they're doin' the Darktown strut 
 Y'always got to be prepared, but you never know for what 
 There ain't no limit to the amount of trouble women bring 
 Love is pleasing, love is teasing, love not an evil thing 
 Sugar baby get on down the road 
 You ain't got no brains nohow 
 You went years without me 
 Might as well keep goin' now 
 Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick 
 Happiness can come suddenly and leave just as quick 
 Any minute of the day, the bubble could burst 
 Try to make things better for someone sometimes you just end up 
 Makin' it a thousand times worse 
 Sugar baby get on down the road 
 You ain't got no brains nohow 
 You went years without me 
 Might as well keep goin' now 
 Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one 
 You got a way of tearin' a world apart, love, see what you've done 
 Just as sure as we're livin', just as sure as you're born 
 Look up, look up, seek your Maker, 'fore Gabriel blows his horn 
 Sugar baby, get on down the line 
 You ain't got no sense nohow 
 You went years without me 
 Might as well keep goin' now"

 I was thinkin' 'bout Alicia Keys, couldn't keep from crying 
 When she was born in Hell's Kitchen, I was living down the line 
 I'm wondering where in the world Alicia Keys could be 
 I been looking for her even clear through Tennessee 
 Feel like my soul is beginning to expand 
 Look into my heart and you will sort of understand 
 You brought me here, now you're trying to run me away 
 The writing on the wall, come read it, come see what it say 
 Thunder on the mountain, rollin' like a drum 
 Gonna sleep over there, that's where the music coming from 
 I don't need any guide, I already know the way 
 Remember this, I'm your servant both night and day 
 The pistols are poppin' and the power is down 
 I'd like to try somethin' but I'm so far from town 
 The sun keeps shinin' and the North Wind keeps picking up speed 
 Gonna forget about myself for a while, gonna go out and see what others need 
 I've been sittin' down studyin' the art of love 
 I think it will fit me like a glove 
 I want some real good woman to do just what I say 
 Everybody got to wonder what's the matter with this cruel world today 
 Thunder on the mountain rolling to the ground 
 Gonna get up in the morning walk the hard road down 
 Some sweet day I'll stand beside my king 
 I wouldn't betray your love or any other thing 
 Gonna raise me an army, some tough sons of bitches 
 I'll recruit my army from the orphanages 
 I been to St. Herman's church, said my religious vows 
 I've sucked the milk out of a thousand cows 
 I got the porkchops, she got the pie 
 She ain't no angel and neither am I 
 Shame on your greed, shame on your wicked schemes 
 I'll say this, I don't give a damn about your dreams 
 Thunder on the mountain heavy as can be 
 Mean old twister bearing down on me 
 All the ladies in Washington were scrambling to get out of town 
 Looks like something bad gonna happen, better roll your airplane down 
 Everybody going and I want to go too 
 Don't wanna take a chance with somebody new 
 I did all I could, I did it right there and then 
 I've already confessed, no need to confess again 
 Gonna make a lot of money, gonna go up north 
 I'll plant and I'll harvest what the earth brings forth 
 The hammer's on the table, the pitchfork's on the shelf 
 For the love of God, you ought to take pity on yourself"

 Darkness on the face of the deep 
 I keep thinking about you baby 
 I can't hardly sleep 
 I'm traveling by land 
 Traveling through the dawn of day 
 You're always on my mind 
 I can't stay away 
 I'd forgotten 'bout you 
 Then you turned up again 
 I always knew 
 We were meant to be more than friends 
 When you're near 
 It's just as plain as it can be 
 I'm wild about you, gal 
 You ought to be a fool about me 
 Can't explain 
 The sources of this hidden pain 
 You burned your way into my heart 
 You got the key to my brain 
 I've been trampling through mud 
 Praying to the powers above 
 I'm sweating blood 
 You got a face that begs for love 
 Life without you 
 Doesn't mean a thing to me 
 If I can't have you 
 I'll throw my love into the deep blue sea 
 Sometimes I wonder 
 Why you can't treat me right 
 You do good all day 
 And then you do wrong all night 
 When you're with me 
 I'm a thousand times happier than I could ever say 
 What does it matter 
 What price I pay 
 They brag about your sugar 
 Brag about it all over town 
 Put some sugar in my bowl 
 I feel like laying down 
 I'm as pale as a ghost 
 Holding a blossom on a stem 
 You ever seen a ghost? No 
 But you have heard of them 
 I see you there 
 I'm blinded by the colors I see 
 I take good care 
 Of what belongs to me 
 I hear your name 
 Ringing up and down the line 
 I'm saying it plain 
 These ties are strong enough to bind 
 Now your sweet voice 
 Calls out from some old familiar shrine 
 I got no choice 
 Can't believe these things would ever fade from your mind 
 I could live forever 
 With you perfectly 
 You don't ever 
 Have to make a fuss over me 
 From East to West 
 Ever since the world began 
 I only mean it for the best 
 I want to be with you any way I can 
 I been in a brawl 
 Now I'm feeling the wall 
 I'm going away baby 
 I won't be back till fall 
 High on the hill 
 You can carry all my thoughts with you 
 You've numbed my will 
 This love could tear me in two 
 I wanna be with you in paradise 
 And it seems so unfair 
 I can't go to paradise no more 
 I killed a man back there 
 You think I'm over the hill 
 You think I'm past my prime 
 Let me see what you got 
 We can have a whoppin' good time"

 I got troubles so hard, I just can't stand the strain 
 Some young lazy slut has charmed away my brains

 Well, I get up in the dawn and I go down and lay in the shade 
 I get up in the dawn and I go down and lay in the shade 
 I ain't nobody's house boy, I ain't nobody's well trained maid 
 I'm flat out spent, this woman been drivin' me to tears 
 I'm flat out spent, this woman she been drivin' me to tears 
 This woman so crazy, I swear I ain't gonna touch another one for years 
 Well, the warm weather's comin' and the buds are on the vine 
 The warm weather's comin', the buds are on the vine 
 Ain't nothing so depressing as trying to satisfy this woman of mine 
 I got up this mornin', saw the rising sun return 
 Well, I got up this mornin', see the rising sun return 
 Sooner or later, you too shall burn 
 The night's filled with shadows, the years are filled with early doom 
 The night is filled with shadows, the years are filled with early doom 
 I've been conjuring up all these long dead souls from their crumblin' tombs 
 Let's forgive each other darlin', let's go down to the greenwood glen 
 Let's forgive each other darlin', let's go down to the greenwood glen 
 Let's put our heads together now, let's put all old matters to an end

341,Bob Dylan,rock,When The Deal Goes Down,"In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light 
 Where wisdom grows up in strife 
 My bewildered brain toils in vain 
 Through the darkness on the pathways of life 
 Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air 
 Tomorrow keeps turning around 
 We live and we die, we know not why 
 But I'll be with you when the deal goes down 
 We eat and we drink, we feel and we think 
 Far down the street we stray 
 I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by 
 Things I never meant nor wished to say 
 The midnight rain follows the train 
 We all wear the same thorny crown 
 Soul to soul, our shadows roll 
 And I'll be with you when the deal goes down 
 Well, the moon gives light and it shines by night 
 When I scarcely feel the glow 
 We learn to live and then we forgive 
 O'er the road we're bound to go 
 More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours 
 That keep us so tightly bound 
 You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies 
 And I'll be with you when the deal goes down 
 Well, I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes 
 I followed the winding stream 
 I heard the deafening noise, I felt transient joys 
 I know they're not what they seem 
 In this earthly domain full of disappointment and pain 
 You'll never see me frown 
 I owe my heart to you and that's sayin' it true 
 And I'll be with you when the deal goes down"
342,Bob Dylan,rock,Someday Baby,"I don't care what you do, I don't care what you say 
 I don't care where you go or how long you stay 
 Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me anymore 
 Well you take my money and you turn it out 
 You fill me up with nothin' but self doubt 
 Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me anymore 
 When I was young, driving was my crave 
 You drive me so hard, almost to the grave 
 Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me anymore 
 I'm so hard pressed, my mind tied up in knots 
 I keep recycling the same old thoughts 
 Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me anymore 
 So many good things in life that I overlooked 
 I don't know what to do now, baby, you got me so hooked 
 Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me anymore 
 Well, I don't want to brag, but I'm gonna wring your neck 
 When all else fails I'll make it a matter of self respect 
 Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me anymore 
 You can take your clothes put 'em in a sack 
 You goin' down the road, baby and you can't come back 
 Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me anymore 
 I tried to be friendly, I tried to be kind 
 I'm gonna drive you from your home, just like I was driven from mine 
 Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me anymore 
 Living this way ain't a natural thing to do 
 Why was I born to love you? 
 Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me anymore"
343,Bob Dylan,rock,Workingman's Blues #2,"There's an evenin' haze settlin' over town 
 Starlight by the edge of the creek 
 The buyin' power of the proletariat's gone down 
 Money's gettin' shallow and weak 
 Well, the place I love best is a sweet memory 
 It's a new path that we trod 
 They say low wages are a reality 
 If we want to compete abroad 
 My cruel weapons have been put on the shelf 
 Come sit down on my knee 
 You are dearer to me than myself 
 As you yourself can see 
 While I'm listening to the steel rails hum 
 Got both eyes tight shut 
 Just sitting here trying to keep the hunger from 
 Creeping it's way into my gut 
 Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind 
 Bring me my boots and shoes 
 You can hang back or fight your best on the frontline 
 Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues 
 Well, I'm sailin' on back, ready for the long haul 
 Tossed by the winds and the seas 
 I'll drag 'em all down to hell and I'll stand 'em at the wall 
 I'll sell 'em to their enemies 
 I'm tryin' to feed my soul with thought 
 Gonna sleep off the rest of the day 
 Sometimes no one wants what we got 
 Sometimes you can't give it away 
 Now the place is ringed with countless foes 
 Some of them may be deaf and dumb 
 No man, no woman knows 
 The hour that sorrow will come 
 In the dark I hear the night birds call 
 I can feel a lover's breath 
 I sleep in the kitchen with my feet in the hall 
 Sleep is like a temporary death 
 Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind 
 Bring me my boots and shoes 
 You can hang back or fight your best on the frontline 
 Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues 
 Well, they burned my barn and they stole my horse 
 I can't save a dime 
 I got to be careful, I don't want to be forced 
 Into a life of continual crime 
 I can see for myself that the sun is sinking 
 How I wish you were here to see 
 Tell me now, am I wrong in thinking 
 That you have forgotten me? 
 Now they worry and they hurry and they fuss and they fret 
 They waste your nights and days 
 Them I will forget 
 But you I'll remember always 
 Old memories of you to me have clung 
 You've wounded me with your words 
 Gonna have to straighten out your tongue 
 It's all true, everything you've heard 
 Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind 
 Bring me my boots and shoes 
 You can hang back or fight your best on the frontline 
 Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues 
 In you, my friend, I find no blame 
 Wanna look in my eyes, please do 
 No one can ever claim 
 That I took up arms against you 
 All across the peaceful sacred fields 
 They will lay you low 
 They'll break your horns and slash you with steel 
 I say it so it must be so 
 Now I'm down on my luck and I'm black and blue 
 Gonna give you another chance 
 I'm all alone, I'm expecting you 
 To lead me off in a cheerful dance 
 I got a brand new suit and a brand new wife 
 I can live on rice and beans 
 Some people never worked a day in their life 
 Don't know what work even means 
 Well, meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind 
 Bring me my boots and shoes 
 You can hang back or fight your best on the frontline 
 Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues"
344,Bob Dylan,rock,Beyond The Horizon,"Beyond the horizon, behind the sun 
 At the end of the rainbow life has only begun 
 In the long hours of twilight 'neath the stardust above 
 Beyond the horizon it is easy to love 
 I'm touched with desire 
 What don't I do? 
 Through flame and through fire 
 I'll build my world around you 
 Beyond the horizon, in the Springtime or Fall 
 Love waits forever, for one and for all 
 Beyond the horizon, across the divide 
 'Round about midnight, we'll be on the same side 
 Down in the valley the water runs cold 
 Beyond the horizon someone prayed for your soul 
 My wretched heart is pounding 
 I felt an angel's kiss 
 My memories are drowning 
 In mortal bliss 
 Beyond the horizon, at the end of the game 
 Every step that you take, I'm walking the same 
 Beyond the horizon, the night winds blow 
 The theme of a melody from many moons ago 
 The bells of St. Mary, how sweetly they chime 
 Beyond the horizon I found you just in time 
 It's dark and it's dreary 
 I've been pleading in vain 
 I'm wounded and I'm weary 
 My repentance is plain 
 Beyond the horizon, over the treacherous sea 
 I still can't believe that you have set aside your love for me 
 Beyond the horizon, 'neath crimson skies 
 In the soft light of morning I'll follow you with my eyes 
 Through countries and kingdoms and temples of stone 
 Beyond the horizon right down to the bone 
 It's the right time of the season 
 Somebody there always cared 
 There's always a reason 
 Why someone's life has been spared 
 Beyond the horizon, the sky is so blue 
 I've got more than a lifetime to live lovin' you"
345,Bob Dylan,rock,Nettie Moore,"Lost John's sittin' on a railroad track 
 Something's out of whack 
 Blues this mornin' fallin' down like hail 
 Gonna leave a greasy trail 
 Gonna travel the world is what I'm gonna do 
 Then come back and see you 
 All I ever do is struggle and strive 
 If I don't do anybody any harm, I might make it back home alive 
 I'm the oldest son of a crazy man 
 I'm in a cowboy band 
 Got a pile of sins to pay for and I ain't got time to hide 
 I'd walk through a blazing fire, baby, if I knew you was on the other side 
 Oh, I miss you, Nettie Moore 
 And my happiness is over 
 Winter's gone, the river's on the rise 
 I loved you then and ever shall 
 But there's no one left here to tell 
 The world has gone black before my eyes 
 Well, the world of research has gone berserk 
 Too much paperwork 
 Albert's in the graveyard, Frankie's raising hell 
 I'm beginning to believe what the scriptures tell 
 I've gone where the Southern crosses The Yellow Dog 
 Get away from all these demagogues 
 And these bad luck women stick like glue 
 It's either one or the other or neither of the two 
 She says, 
 ""Look out, daddy, don't want you to tear your pants. 
 You could get wrecked in this dance."" 
 They say whisky'll kill you, but I don't think it will 
 I'm ridin' with you to the top of the hill 
 Oh, I miss you, Nettie Moore 
 And my happiness is over 
 Winter's gone, the river's on the rise 
 I loved you then and ever shall 
 But there's no one left here to tell 
 The world has gone black before my eyes 
 Don't know why my baby never looked so good before 
 Don't have to wonder no more 
 She been cooking all day, it gonna take me all night 
 I can't eat all that stuff in a single bite 
 The judge is coming in, everybody rise 
 Lift up your eyes 
 You can do what you please, you don't need my advice 
 'Fore you call me any dirty names, you better think twice 
 Gettin' light outside, the temperature dropped 
 I think the rain has stopped 
 I'm gonna make you come to grips with fate 
 When I'm through with you, you'll learn to keep your business straight 
 Oh, I miss you, Nettie Moore 
 And my happiness is over 
 Winter's gone, the river's on the rise 
 I loved you then and ever shall 
 But there's no one left here to tell 
 The world has gone black before my eyes 
 The bright spark of the steady lights 
 Has dimmed my sights 
 When you're around me all my grief gives way 
 A lifetime with you is like some heavenly day 
 Everything I've ever known to be right has been proven wrong 
 I'll be drifting along 
 The woman I'm a-loving, she rules my heart 
 No knife could ever cut our love apart 
 Today I'll stand in faith and raise 
 The voice of praise 
 The sun is strong, I'm standing in the light 
 I wish to God that it were night 
 Oh, I miss you, Nettie Moore 
 And my happiness is over 
 Winter's gone, the river's on the rise 
 I loved you then and ever shall 
 But there's no one here left to tell 
 The world has gone black before my eyes"
346,Bob Dylan,rock,The Levee's Gonna Break,"If it keep on rainin', the levee gonna break 
 If it keep on rainin', the levee gonna break 
 Everybody saying this is a day only the Lord could make 
 Well, I worked on the levee, Mama, both night and day 
 I worked on the levee, Mama, both night and day 
 I got to the river and I threw my clothes away 
 I paid my time and now I'm as good as new 
 I paid my time and now I'm as good as new 
 They can't take me back unless I want 'em to 
 If it keep on rainin', the levee gonna break 
 If it keep on rainin', the levee gonna break 
 Some of these people gonna strip you of all they can take 
 I can't stop here I ain't ready to unload 
 I can't stop here I ain't ready to unload 
 Riches and salvation can be waiting behind the next bend in the road 
 I picked you up from the gutter and this is the thanks I get 
 I picked you up from the gutter and this is the thanks I get 
 You say you want me to quit ya, I told ya, 
 ""No, not just yet."" 
 Well, I look in your eyes, I see nobody other than me 
 I look in your eyes, I see nobody other than me 
 I see all that I am and all I hope to be 
 If it keep on rainin', the levee gonna break 
 If it keep on rainin', the levee gonna break 
 Some of these people don't know which road to take 
 When I'm with you, I forget I was ever blue 
 When I'm with you, I forget I was ever blue 
 Without you there's no meaning in anything I do 
 Some people on the road carryin' everything that they own 
 Some people on the road carryin' everything they own 
 Some people got barely enough skin to cover their bones 
 Put on your cat clothes, mama, put on your evening dress 
 Put on your cat clothes, mama, put on your evening dress 
 Few more years of hard work, then there'll be a 1,000 years of happiness 
 If it keep on rainin', the levee gonna break 
 If it keep on rainin', the levee gonna break 
 I tried to get you to love me, but I won't repeat that mistake 
 If it keep on rainin', the levee gonna break 
 If it keep on rainin', the levee gonna break 
 Plenty of cheap stuff out there and still around that you take 
 I woke up this morning, butter and eggs in my bed 
 I woke up this morning, butter and eggs in my bed 
 I ain't got enough room to even raise my head 
 Come back, baby, say we never more will part 
 Come back, baby, say we never more will part 
 Don't be a stranger with no brain or heart 
 If it keep on rainin', the levee gonna break 
 If it keep on rainin', the levee gonna break 
 Some people still sleepin', some people are wide awake"
347,Bob Dylan,rock,Ain't Talkin',"As I walked out tonight in the mystic garden 
 The wounded flowers were dangling from the vine 
 I was passing by yon cool crystal fountain 
 Someone hit me from behind 
 Ain't talking, just walking 
 Through this weary world of woe 
 Heart burning, still yearning 
 No one on earth would ever know 
 They say prayer has the power to heal, so pray for me, mother 
 In the human heart an evil spirit can dwell 
 I am trying to love my neighbor and do good unto others 
 But oh, mother, things ain't going well 
 Ain't talking, just walking 
 I'll burn that bridge before you can cross 
 Heart burning, still yearning 
 There'll be no mercy for you once you've lost 
 Now I'm all worn down by weeping 
 My eyes are filled with tears, my lips are dry 
 If I catch my opponents ever sleeping 
 I will just slaughter 'em where they lie 
 Ain't talking, just walking 
 Through the world mysterious and vague 
 Heart burning, still yearning 
 Walking through the cities of the plague 
 Well, the whole world is filled with speculation 
 The whole wide world which people say is round 
 They will tear your mind away from contemplation 
 They will jump on your misfortune when you're down 
 Ain't talking, just walking 
 Eating hog eyed grease in a hog eyed town 
 Heart burning, still yearning 
 Some day you'll be glad to have me around 
 They will crush you with wealth and power 
 Every waking moment you could crack 
 I'll make the most of one last extra hour 
 I'll avenge my father's death and I'll step back 
 Ain't talking, just walking 
 Hand me down my walking cane 
 Heart burning, still yearning 
 Got to get you out of my miserable brain 
 All my loyal and my much-loved companions 
 They approve of me and share my code 
 I practice a faith that's been long abandoned 
 Ain't no altars on this long and lonesome road 
 Ain't talking, just walking 
 My mule is sick, my horse is blind 
 Heart burning, still yearning 
 Thinking about that girl I left behind 
 Well, it's bright in the heavens and the wheels are flying 
 Fame and honor never seem to fade 
 The fire gone out but the light is never dying 
 Who says I can't get heavenly aid? 
 Ain't talking, just walking 
 Carrying a dead man's shield 
 Heart burning, still yearning 
 Walking with a toothache in my heel 
 The suffering is unending 
 Every nook and cranny has its tears 
 I'm not playing, I'm not pretending 
 I'm not nursing any superfluous fears 
 Ain't talking, just walking 
 Walking ever since the other night 
 Heart burning, still yearning 
 Walking till I'm clean out of sight 
 As I walked out in the mystic garden 
 On a hot summer day, a hot summer lawn 
 Excuse me, ma'am, I beg your pardon 
 There's no one here, the gardener is gone 
 Ain't talking, just walking 
 Up the road, around the bend 
 Heart burning, still yearning 
 In the last outback at the world's end"
348,Bob Dylan,rock,Beyond Here Lies Nothin',"Oh well, I love you, pretty baby 
 You're the only love I've ever known 
 Just as long as you stay with me 
 The whole world is my throne 
 Beyond here lies nothin' 
 Nothin' we can call our own 
 Well, I'm moving after midnight 
 Down boulevards of broken cars 
 Don't know what I'd do without it 
 Without this love that we call ours 
 Beyond here lies nothin' 
 Nothin' but the moon and stars 
 Down every street there's a window 
 And every window made of glass 
 We'll keep on loving, pretty baby 
 For as long as love will last 
 Beyond here lies nothin' 
 But the mountains of the past 
 Well, my ship is in the harbor 
 And the sails are spread 
 Listen to me, pretty baby 
 Lay your hand upon my head 
 Beyond here lies nothin' 
 Nothin' done and nothin' said"
349,Bob Dylan,rock,Life Is Hard,"The evening winds are still 
 I've lost the way and will 
 Can’t tell you where they went 
 I just know what they meant 
 I’m always on my guard 
 Admitting life is hard 
 Without you near me 
 The friend you used to be 
 So near and dear to me 
 You slipped so far away 
 Where did we go astray? 
 I passed the old school yard 
 Admitting life is hard 
 Without you near me 
 Ever since the day 
 The day you went away 
 I felt that emptiness so wide 
 I don’t know what's wrong or right 
 I just know I need strength to fight 
 Strength to fight that world outside 
 Since we've been out of touch 
 I haven't felt that much 
 From day to barren day 
 My heart stays locked away 
 I walk the boulevard 
 Admitting life is hard 
 Without you near me 
 The sun is sinking low 
 I guess it's time to go 
 I feel a chilly breeze 
 In place of memories 
 My dreams are locked and barred 
 Admitting life is hard 
 Without you near me 
 Hmmm, without you near me"
350,Bob Dylan,rock,My Wife's Home Town,"Well, I didn’t come here to deal with a dog gone thing 
 I just came here to hear the drummer's cymbal ring 
 There ain’t no way you can put me down 
 I just wanna say that hell’s my wife’s home town 
 Well, there’s reasons for that and reasons for this 
 I can’t think of any just now, but I know they exist 
 I’m sittin in the sun ‘till my skin turns brown 
 I just wanna say that hell’s my wife’s home town, home town, home town 
 She can make you steal, make you rob 
 Give you the hives, make you lose your job 
 Make things bad, she can make things worse 
 She got stuff more potent than a gypsy curse 
 One of these days I’ll end up on the run 
 I'm pretty sure she'll make me kill someone 
 I’m going inside, roll the shutters down 
 I just wanna say that hell’s my wife’s home town 
 Well, there’s plenty to remember, plenty to forget 
 I still can remember the day we met 
 I lost my reasons long ago 
 My love for her is all I know 
 State gone broke, the county's dry 
 Don't be lookin' at me with that evil eye 
 Keep on walking, don’t be hanging around 
 I’m tellin you again that hell’s my wife’s home town 
 Home town, ha ha, home town"
351,Bob Dylan,rock,If You Ever Go To Houston,"If you ever go to Houston 
 Better walk right 
 Keep your hands in your pockets 
 And your gun belt tight 
 If you’re asking for trouble 
 If you’re looking for a fight 
 If you ever go to Houston 
 Boy, you better walk right 
 If you're ever down there 
 On back near Lamar 
 You better watch out for 
 The man with the shining star 
 Better know where you're going 
 Or stay where you are 
 If you’re ever down there 
 On back near Lamar 
 Well, I know these streets 
 I’ve been here before 
 I nearly got killed here 
 During the Mexican War 
 Something always 
 Keeps me coming back for more 
 I know these streets 
 I’ve been here before 
 If you ever go to Dallas 
 Say hello to Mary Ann 
 Say I’m still looking along the trigger 
 Hanging on the best I can 
 If you see her sister Lucy 
 Say I’m sorry I’m not there 
 Tell her other sister Nancy 
 To pray the sinner's prayer 
 I got a restless fever 
 Burnin' in my brain 
 Gotta keep ridin' forward 
 Can’t spoil the game 
 The same way I’ll leave here 
 Will be the way that I came 
 Got a restless fever 
 Burnin' in my brain 
 Mister policeman 
 Can you help me find my gal? 
 Last time I saw her 
 Was at the Magnolia Motel 
 If you help me find her 
 You can be my pal 
 Mister policeman 
 Can you help me find my gal? 
 If you ever go to Austin 
 Fort Worth or San Anton' 
 Find the barrooms I got lost in 
 And send my memories home 
 Put my tears in a bottle 
 Screw the top on tight 
 If you ever go to Houston 
 Boy, you’d better walk right"
352,Bob Dylan,rock,Forgetful Heart,"Forgetful heart 
 Lost your power of recall 
 Every little detail 
 You don't remember at all 
 The times we knew 
 Who would remember better than you? 
 Forgetful heart 
 We laughed and had a good time, you and I 
 It's been so long 
 Now you're content to let the days go by 
 When you were there 
 You were the answer to my prayer 
 Forgetful heart 
 We loved with all the love that life can give 
 What can I say? 
 Without you it's so hard to live 
 Can't take much more 
 Why can't we love like we did before? 
 Forgetful heart 
 Like a walking shadow in my brain 
 All night long 
 I lay awake and listen to the sound of pain 
 The door has closed forevermore 
 If indeed there ever was a door"
353,Bob Dylan,rock,Jolene,"Well, you're coming down High Street walking in the sun 
 You make a dead man rise and holler she's the one 
 Jolene, Jolene 
 Baby, I am the king and you're the queen 
 Well, it’s a long old highway that don’t ever end 
 I got a Saturday Night Special, I’m back again 
 I’ll sleep by your door, lay my life on the line 
 You probably don’t know but I’m gonna make you mine 
 Jolene, Jolene 
 Baby, I am the king and you is the queen 
 I keep my hands in my pocket, I’m movin’ along 
 People think they know, but they’re all wrong 
 You're something nice, I’m gonna bet my dice 
 I can’t say I haven't paid the price 
 Jolene, Jolene 
 Baby, I am the king and you is the queen 
 Well, I found out the hard way, I’ve had my fill 
 You can't fight somebody with his back to a hill 
 Those big brown eyes, they set off a spark 
 If you hold me in your arms, things don’t look so dark 
 Jolene, Jolene 
 Baby, I am the king and you're the queen"
354,Bob Dylan,rock,This Dream Of You,"How long can I stay 
 In this nowhere café 'fore night turns into day 
 I wonder why I’m so frightened of dawn 
 All I have and all I know 
 Is this dream of you which keeps me living on 
 There’s a moment when 
 All old things become new again 
 But that moment might have come and gone 
 All I have and all I know 
 Is this dream of you which keeps me living on 
 I look away but I keep seeing it 
 I don’t want to believe but I keep believing it 
 Shadows dance upon the wall 
 Shadows that seem to know it all 
 Am I too blind to see 
 Is my heart playing tricks on me 
 I’m lost in the crowd, all my tears are gone 
 All I have and all I know 
 Is this dream of you which keeps me living on 
 Everything I touch seems to disappear 
 Everywhere I turn, you are always here 
 I’ll run this race until my earthly death 
 I’ll defend this place with my dying breath 
 From a cheerless room 
 In a curtain gloom, I saw a star from Heaven fall 
 I turned and looked again but it was gone 
 All I have and all I know 
 Is this dream of you which keeps me living on"

 Well, it’s early in the evening and everything is still 
 One more time, I’m walking up on top of the hill 
 Shake shake Mama like a ship going out to sea 
 Shake shake Mama like a ship going out to sea 
 You took all my money and you gave it to Richard Lee 
 Down by the river judge Simpson’s walking around 
 Down by the river judge Simpson’s walking around 
 Nothing shocks me more than that old clown 
 Some of you women, you really know your stuff 
 Some of you women, you really know your stuff 
 But your clothes are all torn and your language is a little too rough 
 Shake shake Mama, shake until the break of day 
 Shake shake Mama, shake until the break of day 
 I’m right here baby, I’m not that far away 
 I'm motherless, fatherless, almost friendless too 
 I'm motherless, fatherless, almost friendless too

 Looking far off into the East 
 And I see my baby comin' 
 She's walking with the village priest 
 I feel a change comin' on 
 And the last part of the day is already gone 
 We've got so much in common 
 We strive for the same old ends 
 And I just can't wait 
 Wait for us to become friends 
 I feel a change comin' on 
 And the fourth part of the day is already gone 
 Well, life is for love 
 And they say that love is blind 
 If you want to live easy 
 Baby, pack your clothes with mine 
 I feel a change comin' on 
 And the fourth part of the day is already gone 
 Well, now what's the use in dreamin' 
 You got better things to do 
 Dreams never did work for me anyway 
 Even when they did come true 
 You are as whorish as ever 
 Baby, you can start a fire 
 I must be losing my mind 
 You're the object of my desire 
 I feel a change comin' on 
 And the fourth part of the day is already gone 
 I'm a-listening to Billy Joe Shaver 
 And I'm reading James Joyce 
 Some people, they tell me 
 I've got the blood of the land in my voice 
 Everybody got all the money 
 Everybody got all the beautiful clothes 
 Everybody got all the flowers 
 I don't have one single rose 
 I feel a change comin' on 
 And the fourth part of the day's already gone"
357,Bob Dylan,rock,It's All Good,"Talk about me babe, if you must 
 Throw on the dirt, pile on the dust 
 I’d do the same thing if I could 
 You know what they say, they say it’s all good 
 All good, it’s all good 
 Big politicians telling lies 
 Restaurant kitchen, all full of flies 
 Don't make a bit of difference 
 Don‘t see why it should 
 But it’s all right, 'cause it’s all good 
 It’s all good, it’s all good 
 Wives are leaving their husbands, they’re beginning to roam 
 They leave the party, and they never get home 
 I wouldn’t change it, even if I could 
 You know what they say man, it’s all good 
 It’s all good, all good 
 Brick by brick they tear you down 
 A teacup of water is enough to drown 
 You oughta know if they could, they would 
 Whatever going down, it’s all good 
 All good, say it’s all good 
 People in the country, people on the land 
 Some of ‘em so sick, they can hardly stand 
 Everybody would move away, if they could 
 It’s hard to believe, but it’s all good 
 Yeah 
 The widows cry, the orphans plea 
 Everywhere you look there’s more misery 
 Come along with me babe, I wish you would 
 You know what I'm saying, it’s all good 
 All good, I said it’s all good, all good 
 A cold blooded killer stalking the town 
 Cop cars blinkin', something bad going down 
 Buildings are crumbling in the neighborhood 
 But there's nothing to worry about, 'cause it's all good 
 It’s all good, I say it's all good, whoo 
 I'm gonna pluck off your beard and blow it in your face 
 This time tomorrow I’ll be rolling in your place 
 I wouldn’t change a thing, even if I could 
 You know what they say, they say it’s all good 
 It’s all good, oh yeah"
358,Bob Dylan,rock,Here Comes Santa Claus,"Here comes Santa Claus! 
 Here comes Santa Claus! 
 Right down Santa Claus Lane! 
 Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer 
 Are pulling on the reins 
 Bells are ringing, children singing 
 All is merry and bright 
 Hang your stockings and say your prayers 
 'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight 
 Here comes Santa Claus! 
 Here comes Santa Claus! 
 Right down Santa Claus Lane! 
 He's got a bag that is filled with toys 
 For the boys and girls again 
 Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle 
 What a beautiful sight 
 Jump in bed, cover up your head 
 'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight"
359,Bob Dylan,rock,Do You Hear What I Hear?,"Said the night wind to the little lamb 
 ""Do you see what I see? 
 Way up in the sky, little lamb 
 Do you see what I see? 
 A star, a star, dancing in the night 
 With a tail as big as a kite 
 With a tail as big as a kite"" 
 Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy 
 ""Do you hear what I hear? 
 Ringing through the sky, shepherd boy 
 Do you hear what I hear? 
 A song, a song high above the trees 
 With a voice as big as the the sea 
 With a voice as big as the the sea"" 
 Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king 
 ""Do you know what I know? 
 In your palace warm, mighty king 
 Do you know what I know? 
 A Child, a Child shivers in the cold 
 Let us bring him silver and gold 
 Let us bring him silver and gold"" 
 Said the king to the people everywhere 
 ""Listen to what I say 
 Pray for peace, people, everywhere 
 Listen to what I say 
 The Child, the Child sleeping in the night 
 He will bring us goodness and light 
 He will bring us goodness and light"""
360,Bob Dylan,rock,Winter Wonderland,"Sleigh bells ring, are you listening? 
 In the lane snow is glistening 
 A beautiful sight 
 We're happy tonight 
 Walking in a winter wonderland 
 Gone away is the bluebird 
 Here to stay is a new bird 
 He sings a love song 
 As we go along 
 Walking in a winter wonderland 
 In the meadow we can build a snowman 
 Then pretend that he is Parson Brown 
 He'll say, ""Are you married?"" We'll say, ""No, man"" 
 But you can do the job when you're in town 
 Later on we'll conspire 
 As we dream by the fire 
 To face unafraid 
 The plans that we've made 
 Walking in a winter wonderland 
 In the meadow we can build a snowman 
 And pretend that he's a circus clown 
 We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman 
 Until the other kids knock him down 
 When it snows ain't it thrilling? 
 Though your nose gets a chilling 
 We'll frolic and play 
 The Eskimo way 
 Walking in a winter wonderland"

 Born to give them second birth

 You can plan on me 
 Please have snow and mistletoe

 Where the lovelight gleams 
 I'll be home for Christmas 
 If only in my dreams 
 I'll be home for Christmas

 A new born king to see 
 Our finest gifts we bring 
 To lay before the king 
 So to honor him 
 When we come 
 Little Baby 
 I am a poor boy too 
 I have no gift to bring 
 That's fit to give the king 
 Shall I play for you 
 On my drum? 
 Mary nodded 
 The ox and lamb kept time 
 I played my drum for him 
 I played my best for him 
 Then He smiled at me 
 Me and my drum"
364,Bob Dylan,rock,The Christmas Blues,"The jingle bells are jingling 
 The streets are white with snow 
 The happy crowds are mingling 
 But there's no one that I know 
 I'm sure that you'll forgive me 
 If I don't enthuse 
 I guess I've got the Christmas blues 
 I've done my window shopping 
 There's not a store I've missed 
 But what's the use of stopping 
 When there's no one on your list 
 You'll know the way I'm feeling 
 When you love and you lose 
 I guess I've got the Christmas blues 
 When somebody wants you 
 Somebody needs you 
 Christmas is a joy of joy 
 But friends when you're lonely 
 You'll find that it's only 
 A thing for little girls and little boys 
 May all your days be merry 
 Your seasons full of cheer 
 But 'til it's January 
 I'll just go and disappear 
 Oh Santa may have brought you 
 Some stars for your shoes 
 But Santa only brought me the blues 
 Those brightly packaged tinsel covered Christmas blues"

 Hang a shining star upon the highest bough"

368,Bob Dylan,rock,Silver Bells,"City sidewalks, busy sidewalks 
 Dressed in holiday style 
 In the air 
 There's a feeling of Christmas 
 Children laughing 
 People passing 
 Meeting smile after smile 
 And on every street corner you'll hear 
 Silver bells, silver bells 
 It's Christmas time in the city 
 Ring-a-ling, hear them ring 
 Soon it will be Christmas day 
 City streetlights 
 Even stop lights 
 Blink a bright red and green 
 As the shoppers rush 
 Home with their treasures 
 Hear the snow crunch 
 See the kids bunch 
 This is Santa's big scene 
 And above all this bustle 
 You'll hear 
 Silver bells, silver bells 
 It's Christmas time in the city 
 Ring-a-ling, hear them ring 
 Soon it will be Christmas day"
369,Bob Dylan,rock,The First Noel,"The first noel the angels did say 
 Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay 
 In fields where they lay a-keeping their sheep 
 On a cold winter's night that was so deep 
 Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel 
 Born is the King of Israel 
 They looked up and saw a star 
 Shining in the East beyond them far 
 And to the Earth it gave great light 
 And so it continued both day and night 
 Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel 
 Born is the King of Israel 
 Kissed by the light of that same star 
 Three wise men came from country far 
 To seek for a king was their intent 
 And to follow the star wherever it went 
 Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel 
 Born is the King of Israel 
 A noel"
370,Bob Dylan,rock,Christmas Island,"How'd you like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island? 
 How'd you like to spend a holiday a way across the sea? 
 How'd you like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island? 
 How'd you like to hang a stocking on a great big coconut tree? 
 How'd you like to stay up late like the islanders do 
 Wait for Santa to sail in with your presents in a canoe? 
 If you ever spend Christmas on Christmas Island 
 You will never stray for every day your Christmas dreams come true"
371,Bob Dylan,rock,The Christmas Song,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire 
 Jack Frost nipping at your nose 
 Yuletide carols being sung by a choir 
 And folks dressed up like Eskimos 
 Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe 
 Will help to make the season bright 
 And tiny tots with their eyes all aglow 
 Will find it hard to sleep tonight 
 They know that Santa is on his way 
 He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh 
 And every mother's child is gonna spy 
 To see if reindeer really know how to fly 
 And so I'm offering this simple phrase 
 To kids from 1 to 92 
 Though it's been said many times, many ways 
 Merry Christmas to you 
 They know that Santa is on his way, he's on his way 
 He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh 
 And every mother's child is going to spy 
 To see if reindeer really know how to fly 
 And so I'm offering this simple phrase 
 To kids from 1 to 92 
 Although it's been said many times, many ways 
 Merry Christmas, yeah, merry Christmas 
 Merry Christmas, merry Christmas to you 
 Merry Christmas, merry Christmas

372,Bob Dylan,rock,O' Little Town Of Bethlehem,"O little town of Bethlehem 
 How still we see thee lie 
 Above thy deep and dreamless sleep 
 The silent stars go by 
 Yet in thy dark streets shineth 
 The everlasting light 
 The hopes and fears of all the years 
 Are met in thee tonight 
 O morning stars, together 
 Proclaim the holy birth 
 And praises sing to God the King 
 And peace to men on earth 
 For Christ is born of Mary 
 And gathered all above 
 While mortals sleep, the angels keep 
 Their watch of wondering love 
 How silently, oh how silently 
 The wondrous gift is given 
 So God imparts to human hearts 
 The blessings of his heaven 
 No ear may hear his coming 
 But in this world of sin 
 Where meek souls will receive him, still 
 The dear Christ enters in 
 Where children pure and happy 
 Pray to the blessed Child 
 Where misery cries out to thee 
 Son of the mother mild 
 Where charity stands watching 
 And faith holds wide the door 
 The dark night wakes, the glory breaks 
 And Christmas comes once more 
 O holy Child of Bethlehem 
 Descend to us, we pray 
 Cast out our sin and enter in 
 Be born in us today 
 We hear the Christmas angels 
 The great glad tidings tell 
 O come to us, abide with us 
 Our Lord Emmanuel"
373,Bob Dylan,rock,Duquesne Whistle,"Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing 
 Blowing like it's gonna sweep my world away 
 I wanna stop at Carbondale and keep on going 
 That Duquesne train gon' rock me night and day 
 You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp 
 But I ain't neither one 
 Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing 
 Sound like it's on a final run 
 Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing 
 Blowing like she never blowed before 
 Blue light blinking, red light glowing 
 Blowing like she's at my chamber door 
 You smiling through the fence at me 
 Just like you've always smiled before 
 Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing 
 Blowing like she ain't gon' blow no more 
 Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing? 
 Blowing like the sky's gonna blow apart 
 You're the only thing alive that keeps me going 
 You're like a time bomb in my heart 
 I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling 
 Must be the mother of our Lord 
 Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing 
 Blowing like my woman's on board 
 Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing 
 Blowing like it's gon' blow my blues away 
 You old rascal, I know exactly where you're going 
 I'll lead you there myself at the break of day 
 I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed 
 Everybody telling me she's gone to my head 
 Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing 
 Blowing like it's gon' kill me dead 
 Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing? 
 Blowing through another no good town 
 The lights on my lady's land are glowing 
 I wonder if they'll know me next time 'round 
 I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing 
 That old oak tree, the one we used to climb 
 Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing 
 Blowing like she's blowing right on time"
374,Bob Dylan,rock,Soon After Midnight,"I'm searching for phrases 
 To sing your praises 
 I need to tell someone 
 It's soon after midnight 
 And my day has just begun 
 A gal named Honey 
 Took my money 
 She was passing by 
 It's soon after midnight 
 And the moon is in my eye 
 My heart is cheerful 
 It's never fearful 
 I've been down on the killing floors 
 I'm in no great hurry 
 I'm not afraid of your fury 
 I've faced stronger walls than yours 
 Charlotte's a harlot 
 Dresses in scarlet 
 Mary dresses in green 
 It's soon after midnight 
 And I've got a date with the fairy queen 
 They chirp and they chatter 
 What does it matter? 
 They lie and dine in their blood 
 Two-timing Slim 
 Who's every heard of him? 
 I'll drag his corpse through the mud 
 It's now or never 
 More than ever 
 When I met you I didn't think you would do 
 It's soon after midnight 
 And I don't want nobody but you"
375,Bob Dylan,rock,Narrow Way,"I'm gonna walk across the desert till I'm in my right mind 
 I won't even think about what I left behind 
 Nothing back there anyway I can call my own 
 Go back home, leave me alone 
 It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way 
 If I can't work up to you 
 You'll surely have to work down to me someday 
 Ever since the British burned the White House down 
 There's a bleeding wound in the heart of town 
 I saw you drinking from an empty cup 
 I saw you buried and I saw you dug up 
 It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way 
 If I can't work up to you 
 You'll surely have to work down to me someday 
 Look down angel from the skies 
 Help my weary soul to rise 
 I kissed your cheek, I dragged your plow 
 You broke my heart, I was your friend till now 
 It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way 
 If I can't work up to you 
 You'll surely have to work down to me someday 
 In the courtyard of the golden sun 
 You stand and fight or you break and run 
 You went and lost your lovely head 
 For a drink of wine and a crust of bread 
 It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way 
 If I can't work up to you 
 You'll surely have to work down to me someday 
 We looted and we plundered on distant shores 
 Why is my share not equal to yours 
 Your father left you, your mother too 
 Even death has washed it's hands of you 
 It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way 
 If I can't work up to you 
 You'll surely have to work down to me someday 
 This is hard country to stay alive in 
 Blades are everywhere and they're breaking my skin 
 I'm armed to the hilt and I'm struggling hard 
 You won't get out of here unscarred 
 It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way 
 If I can't work up to you 
 You'll surely have to work down to me someday 
 You got too many lovers waiting at the wall 
 About a thousand tongues, I couldn't count them all 
 Yesterday I could've thrown them all in the sea 
 Today, even one may be too much for me 
 It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way 
 If I can't work up to you 
 You'll surely have to work down to me someday 
 Cakewalking baby, you could do no wrong 
 Put your arms around me, where they belong 
 I won't take you on a roller coaster ride 
 Lay my hands all over you, tie you to my side 
 It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way 
 If I can't work up to you 
 You'll surely have to work down to me someday 
 I've got a heavy stacked woman with a smile on her face 
 And she has crowned my soul with grace 
 Im still hurting from an arrow that pierced my chest 
 I'm gonna have to take my head and bury it between your breasts 
 It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way 
 If I can't work up to you 
 You'll surely have to work down to me someday 
 Been dark all night but now it's dawn 
 The moving finger is moving on 
 You can guard me while I sleep 
 Kiss away the tears I weep 
 It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way 
 If I can't work up to you 
 You'll surely have to work down to me someday 
 I love women and she loves men 
 We've been to the west and we going back again 
 I heard a voice at the dusk of day 
 Saying, ""Be gentle brother, be gentle and pray."" 
 It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way 
 If I can't work up to you 
 You'll surely have to work down to me someday"
376,Bob Dylan,rock,Long And Wasted Years,"It's been such a long, long time 
 Since we loved each other and our hearts were true 
 One time for one brief day, I was the man for you 
 Last night I heard you talkin' in your sleep 
 Saying things you shouldn't say, oh baby 
 You just might have to go to jail someday 
 Is there a place we can go? 
 Is there anybody we can see? 
 Maybe it's the same for you as it is for me 
 I ain't seen my family in twenty years 
 That ain't easy to understand, they may be dead by now 
 I lost track of 'em after they lost their land 
 Shake it up baby, twist and shout 
 You know what it's all about 
 What are you doing out there in the sun anyway? 
 Don't you know the sun can burn your brains right out 
 My enemy crashed into the dust 
 Stopped dead in his tracks and he lost his lust 
 He was run down hard and he broke apart 
 He died in shame, he had an iron heart 
 I wear dark glasses to cover my eyes 
 There are secrets in 'em that I can't disguise 
 Come back, baby, if I hurt your feelings, I apologize 
 Two trains running side by side 
 Forty miles wide, down the Eastern line 
 You don't have to go, I just came to you because you're a friend of mine 
 I think that when my back was turned 
 The whole world behind me burned 
 It's been a while since we walked down that long, long aisle 
 We cried on a cold and frosty morn 
 We cried because our souls were torn 
 So much for tears, so much for these long and wasted years"
377,Bob Dylan,rock,Pay In Blood,"Well I'm grinding my life out, steady and sure 
 Nothing more wretched than what I must endure 
 I'm drenched in the light that shines from the sun 
 I could stone you to death for the wrongs that you done 
 Sooner or later you'll make a mistake 
 I'll put you in a chain that you never will break 
 Legs and arms and body and bone 
 I pay in blood, but not my own 
 Night after night, day after day 
 They strip your useless hopes away 
 The more I take the more I give 
 The more I die the more I live 
 I got something in my pocket make your eyeballs swim 
 I got dogs could tear you limb from limb 
 I'm circling around the Southern Zone 
 I pay in blood, but not my own 
 Low cards are what I've got 
 But I'll play this hand whether I like it or not 
 I'm sworn to uphold the laws of God 
 You can put me out in front of a firing squad 
 I've been out and around with the rowdy men 
 Just like you, my handsome friend 
 My head's so hard, must be made of stone 
 I pay in blood, but not my own 
 Another politician pumping out the piss 
 Another ragged beggar blowing you a kiss 
 You got the same eyes that your mother does 
 If only you could prove who your father was 
 Someone must have slipped a drug in your wine 
 You gulped it down and you crossed the line 
 Man can't live by bread alone 
 I pay in blood, but not my own 
 How I made it back home, nobody knows 
 Or how I survived so many blows 
 I've been through hell, what good did it do? 
 You bastard! I'm suppose to respect you? 
 I'll give you justice, I'll fatten your purse 
 Show me your moral virtues first 
 Hear me holler and hear me moan 
 I pay in blood but not my own 
 You pet your lover in the bed 
 Come here, I'll break your lousy head 
 Our nation must be saved and freed 
 You've been accused of murder, how do you plead? 
 This is how I spend my days 
 I came to bury, not to praise 
 I'll drink my fill and sleep alone 
 I pay in blood, but not my own"
378,Bob Dylan,rock,Scarlet Town,"In Scarlet Town where I was born 
 There's ivy leaf and silver thorn 
 The streets have names that you can't pronounce 
 Gold is down to a quarter an ounce 
 The music starts and the people sway 
 Everybody says, ""Are you going my way?"" 
 Uncle Tom still working for Uncle Bill 
 Scarlet Town is under the hill 
 Scarlet Town in the month of May 
 Sweet William on his deathbed lay 
 Mistress Mary by the side of the bed 
 Kissing his face, heaping prayers on his head 
 So brave, so true, so gentle is he 
 I'll weep for him as he'd weep for me 
 Little Boy Blue come blow your horn 
 In Scarlet Town where I was born 
 Scarlet Town in the hot noon hours 
 There's palm-leaf shadows and scattered flowers 
 Beggars crouching at the gate 
 Help comes but it comes too late 
 On marble slabs and in fields of stone 
 You make your humble wishes known 
 I touched the garment but the hem was torn 
 In Scarlet Town where I was born 
 In Scarlet Town the end is near 
 The seven wonders of the world are here 
 The evil and the good living side by side 
 All human forms seem glorified 
 Put your heart on a platter and see who'll bite 
 See who'll hold you and kiss you good night 
 There's walnut groves and maplewood 
 In Scarlet Town cryin' won't do no good 
 In Scarlet Town you fight your father's foes 
 Up on the hill a chilly wind blows 
 You fight 'em on high and you fight 'em down in 
 You fight 'em with whiskey, morphine and gin 
 You got legs that can drive men mad 
 A lot of things we didn't do that I wish we had 
 In Scarlet Town the sky is clear 
 You'll wish to God that you stayed right here 
 Set 'em up Joe, play Walking the Floor 
 Play it for my flat-chested junky whore 
 I'm staying up late, and I'm making amends 
 While the smile from Heaven descends 
 If love is a sin, then beauty is a crime 
 All things are beautiful in their time 
 The black and the white, the yellow and the brown 
 It's all right there for ya in Scarlet Town"
379,Bob Dylan,rock,Early Roman Kings,"All the early Roman Kings in their shark-skin suits 
 Bowties and buttons, high-top boots 
 Driving the spikes in, blazing the rails 
 Nailed in their coffins in top-hats and tails 
 Fly away little bird, fly away, flap your wings 
 Fly by night like the early Roman Kings 
 All the early Roman Kings in the early, early morn' 
 Coming down the mountain, distributing the corn 
 Speeding through the forest, racing down the track 
 You try to get away, they drag you back 
 Tomorrow is Friday, we'll see what it brings 
 Everybody's talking 'bout the early Roman Kings 
 They're peddlers and they're meddlers, they buy and they sell 
 They destroyed your city, they'll destroy you as well 
 They're lecherous and treacherous, hell-bent for leather 
 Each of them bigger than all manhood together 
 Sluggers and muggers wearing fancy gold rings 
 All the women going crazy for the early Roman Kings 
 I can dress up your wounds with a blood-clotted rag 
 I ain't afraid to make love to a bitch or a hag 
 If you see me coming and you're standing there 
 Wave your handkerchief in the air 
 I ain't dead yet, my bell still rings 
 I keep my fingers crossed like the early Roman Kings 
 I'll strip you of life, strip you of breath 
 Ship you down to the house of death 
 One day you will ask for me 
 There'll be no one else that you'll want to see 
 Bring down my fiddle, tune up my strings 
 I'm gonna break it wide open like the early Roman Kings 
 I was up on Black Mountain the day Detroit fell 
 They killed them all off and they sent them to hell 
 Ding Dong Daddy, you're coming up short 
 Gonna put you on trial in a Sicilian court 
 I've had my fun, I've had my flings 
 Gonna shake 'em all down like the early Roman Kings"
380,Bob Dylan,rock,Tin Angel,"It was late last night when the boss came home 
 To a deserted mansion and a desolate throne 
 Servant said: ""Boss, the lady's gone. 
 She left this morning just 'fore dawn."" 
 ""You got something to tell me, tell it to me, man. 
 Come to the point as straight as you can."" 
 ""Old Henry Lee, chief of the clan 
 Came riding through the woods and took her by the hand."" 
 The boss he lay back flat on his bed 
 He cursed the heat and he clutched his head 
 He pondered the future of his fate 
 To wait another day would be far too late 
 ""Go fetch me my coat and my tie 
 And the cheapest labor that money can buy. 
 Saddle me up my buckskin mare. 
 If you see me go by, put up a prayer."" 
 Well, they rode all night, and they rode all day 
 Eastward, long down the broad highway 
 His spirit was tired and his vision was bent 
 His men deserted him and onward he went 
 He came to a place where the light was dull 
 His forehead pounding in his skull 
 Heavy heart was racked with pain 
 Insomnia raging in his brain 
 Well, he threw down his helmet and his cross-handled sword 
 He renounced his faith, he denied his Lord 
 Crawled on his belly, put his ear to the wall 
 One way or another put an end to it all 
 He leaned down, cut the electric wire 
 Stared into the flames and he snorted the fire 
 Peered through the darkness, caught a glimpse of the two 
 It was hard to tell for certain who was who 
 He lowered himself down on a golden chain 
 His nerves were quaking in every vein 
 His knuckles were bloody, he sucked in the air 
 He ran his fingers through his greasy hair 
 They looked at each other and their glasses clinked 
 One single unit, inseparably linked 
 ""Got a strange premonition. There's a man close by"" (Henry Lee) 
 ""Don't worry about him, he wouldn't harm a fly."" (The Wife) 
 From behind the curtain, the Boss he crossed the floor 
 He moved his feet and he bolted the door 
 Shadows hiding the lines in his face 
 With all the nobility of an ancient race 
 She turned, she was startled with a look of surprise 
 With a hatred that could hit the skies 
 ""You're a reckless fool, I could see it in your eyes. 
 To come this way was by no means wise."" 
 ""Get up, stand up, you greedy-lipped wench 
 And cover your face or suffer the consequence. 
 You are making my heart feel sick. 
 Put your clothes back on, double-quick."" 
 ""Silly boy, you think me a saint. 
 I'll listen no more to your words of complaint. 
 You've given me nothing but the sweetest lies. 
 Now hold your tongue and feed your eyes."" 
 ""I'd have given you the stars and the planets, too. 
 But what good would these things do you? 
 Bow the heart if not the knee 
 Or never again this world you'll see"" 
 ""Oh, please let not your heart be cold. 
 This man is dearer to me than gold."" 
 ""Oh, my dear, you must be blind. 
 He's a gutless ape with a worthless mind."" 
 ""You've had your way too long with me. 
 Now it's me who'll determine how things shall be."" 
 ""Try to escape,"" he cussed and cursed. 
 ""You'll have to try to get past me first."" 
 ""Do not let your passion rule. 
 You think my heart the heart of a fool. 
 And you, sir, you can not deny 
 You made a monkey of me, what and for why?"" 
 ""I'll have no more of this insulting chat. 
 The devil can have you, I'll see to that. 
 Look sharp or step aside 
 Or in the cradle you'll wish you'd died."" 
 The gun went boom and the shot rang clear 
 First bullet grazed his ear 
 Second ball went right straight in 
 And he bent in the middle like a twisted pin 
 He crawled to the corner and he lowered his head 
 He gripped the chair and he grabbed the bed 
 It would take more than needle and thread 
 Bleeding from the mouth, he's as good as dead 
 ""You shot my husband down, you fiend."" 
 ""Husband? What husband? What the hell do you mean? 
 He was a man of strife, a man of sin. 
 I cut him down and threw him to the wind."" 
 This she said with angry breath 
 ""You too shall meet the Lord of Death. 
 It was I who brought your soul to life."" 
 Then she raised her robe and she drew out a knife 
 His face was hard and caked with sweat 
 His arms ached and his hands were wet 
 ""You're a murderous queen and a bloody wife. 
 If you don't mind, I'll have the knife."" 
 ""We're two of a kind and our blood runs hot 
 But we're no way similar in body or thought. 
 All husbands are good men, as all wives know."" 
 Then she pierced him to the heart and his blood did flow 
 His knees went limp and he reached for the door 
 His tomb was sealed, he slid to the floor 
 He whispered in her ear: ""This is all your fault. 
 My fighting days have come to a halt."" 
 She touched his lips and kissed his cheek 
 He tried to speak but his breath was weak 
 ""You died for me, now I'll die for you."" 
 She put the blade to her heart and she ran it through 
 All three lovers together in a heap 
 Thrown into the grave, forever to sleep 
 Funeral torches blazed away 
 Through the towns and the villages all night and all day"
381,Bob Dylan,rock,Tempest,"The pale moon rose in its glory 
 Out on the Western town 
 She told a sad, sad story 
 Of the great ship that went down 
 T'was the fourteenth day of April 
 Over the waves she rode 
 Sailing into tomorrow 
 To a golden age foretold 
 The night was black with starlight 
 The seas were sharp and clear 
 Moving through the shadows 
 The promised hour was near 
 Lights were holding steady 
 Gliding over the foam 
 All the lords and ladies 
 Heading for their eternal home 
 The chandeliers were swaying 
 From the balustrades above 
 The orchestra was playing 
 Songs of faded love 
 The watchman, he lay dreaming 
 As the ballroom dancers twirled 
 He dreamed the Titanic was sinking 
 Into the underworld 
 Leo took his sketchbook 
 He was often so inclined 
 He closed his eyes and painted 
 The scenery in his mind 
 Cupid struck his bosom 
 And broke it with a snap 
 The closest woman to him 
 He fell into her lap 
 He heard a loud commotion 
 Something sounded wrong 
 His inner spirit was saying 
 That he couldn't stand here long 
 He staggered to the quarterdeck 
 No time now to sleep 
 Water on the quarterdeck 
 Already three foot deep 
 Smokestack was leaning sideways 
 Heavy feet began to pound 
 He walked into the whirlwind 
 The sky splitting all around 
 The ship was going under 
 The universe had opened wide 
 The roll was called up yonder 
 The angels turned aside 
 Lights down in the hallway 
 Flickering dim and dull 
 Dead bodies already floating 
 In the double bottom hull 
 The engines then exploded 
 Propellers they failed to start 
 The boilers overloaded 
 The ship's bow split apart 
 Passengers were flying 
 Backward, forward, far and fast 
 They mumbled, fumbled, and tumbled 
 Each one more weary than the last 
 The veil was torn asunder 
 'Tween the hours of twelve and one 
 No change, no sudden wonder 
 Could undo what had been done 
 The watchman lay there dreaming 
 At fourtyfive degrees 
 He dreamed that the Titanic was sinking 
 Dropping to her knees 
 Wellington he was sleeping 
 His bed began to slide 
 His valiant heart was beating 
 He pushed the tables aside 
 Glass of shattered crystal 
 Lay scattered roundabout 
 He strapped on both his pistols 
 How long could he hold out? 
 His men and his companions 
 Were nowhere to be seen 
 In silence there he waited for 
 Time and space to intervene 
 The passageway was narrow 
 There was blackness in the air 
 He saw every kind of sorrow 
 Heard voices everywhere 
 Alarm-bells were ringing 
 To hold back the swelling tide 
 Friends and lovers clinging 
 To each other side by side 
 Mothers and their daughters 
 Descending down the stairs 
 Jumped into the icy waters 
 Love and pity sent their prayers 
 The rich man, Mister Astor 
 Kissed his darling wife 
 He had no way of knowing 
 It'd be the last trip of his life 
 Calvin, Blake and Wilson 
 Gambled in the dark 
 Not one of them would ever live to 
 Tell the tale on the disembark 
 Brother rose up 'gainst brother 
 In every circumstance 
 They fought and slaughtered each other 
 In a deadly dance 
 They lowered down the lifeboats 
 From the sinking wreck 
 There were traitors, there were turncoats 
 Broken backs and broken necks 
 The bishop left his cabin 
 To help others in need 
 Turned his eyes up to the heavens 
 Said, ""The poor are yours to feed"" 
 Davey the brothel-keeper 
 Came out dismissed his girls 
 Saw the water getting deeper 
 Saw the changing of his world 
 Jim Dandy smiled 
 He never learned to swim 
 Saw the little crippled child 
 And he gave his seat to him 
 He saw the starlight shining 
 Streaming from the East 
 Death was on the rampage 
 But his heart was now at peace 
 They battened down the hatches 
 But the hatches wouldn't hold 
 They drowned upon the staircase 
 Of brass and polished gold 
 Leo said to Cleo 
 I think I'm going mad 
 But he'd lost his mind already 
 Whatever mind he had 
 He tried to block the doorway 
 To save all those from harm 
 Blood from an open wound 
 Pouring down his arm 
 Petals fell from flowers 
 'Til all of them were gone 
 In the long and dreadful hours 
 The wizard's curse played on 
 The host was pouring brandy 
 He was going down slow 
 He stayed right to the end and he 
 Was the last to go 
 There were many, many others 
 Nameless here forever more 
 They never sailed the ocean 
 Or left their homes before 
 The watchman, he lay dreaming 
 The damage had been done 
 He dreamed the Titanic was sinking 
 And he tried to tell someone 
 The captain, barely breathing 
 Kneeling at the wheel 
 Above him and beneath him 
 Fifty thousand tons of steel 
 He looked over at his compass 
 And he gazed into its face 
 Needle pointing downward 
 He knew he lost the race 
 In the dark illumination 
 He remembered bygone years 
 He read the Book of Revelation 
 And he filled his cup with tears 
 When the Reaper's task had ended 
 Sixteen hundred had gone to rest 
 The good, the bad, the rich, the poor 
 The loveliest and the best 
 They waited at the landing 
 And they tried to understand 
 But there is no understanding 
 On the judgement of God's hand 
 The news came over the wires 
 And struck with deadly force 
 Love had lost its fires 
 All things had run their course 
 The watchman he lay dreaming 
 Of all the things that can be 
 He dreamed the Titanic was sinking 
 Into the deep blue sea"
382,Bob Dylan,rock,Roll On John,"Doctor, doctor, tell me the time of day 
 Another bottle's empty, another penny spent 
 He turned around and he slowly walked away 
 They shot him in the back and down he went 
 Shine your light 
 Move it on 
 You burn so bright 
 Roll on John 
 From the Liverpool docks to the red light Hamburg streets 
 Down in the quarry with the Quarrymen 
 Playing to the big crowds, playing to the cheap seats 
 Another day in the life on your way to your journey's end 
 Shine your light 
 Move it on 
 You burn so bright 
 Roll on John 
 Sailing through the trade winds bound for the South 
 Rags on your back just like any other slave 
 They tied your hands and they clamped your mouth 
 Wasn't no way out of that deep dark cave 
 Shine your light 
 Move it on 
 You burn so bright 
 Roll on John 
 I heard the news today, oh boy 
 They hauled your ship up on the shore 
 Now the city gone dark, there is no more joy 
 They tore the heart right out and cut it to the core 
 Shine your light 
 Move it on 
 You burn so bright 
 Roll on John 
 Put on your bags and get 'em packed 
 Leave right now you won't be far from wrong 
 The sooner you go, the quicker you'll be back 
 You've been cooped up on an island far too long 
 Shine your light 
 Move it on 
 You burn so bright 
 Roll on John 
 Slow down you're moving way too fast 
 Come together right now over me 
 Your bones are weary, you're about to breathe your last 
 Lord, you know how hard that it can be 
 Shine your light 
 Move it on 
 You burn so bright 
 Roll on John 
 Roll on John, roll through the rain and snow 
 Take the righthand road and go where the buffaloes roam 
 They'll trap you in an ambush 'fore you know 
 Too late now to sail back home 
 Shine your light 
 Move it on 
 You burn so bright 
 Roll on John 
 Tyger, Tyger burning bright 
 I pray the lord my soul to keep 
 In the forest of the night 
 Cover him over and let him sleep 
 Shine your light 
 Move it on 
 You burn so bright 
 Roll on John"
383,Bob Dylan,rock,I'm A Fool To Want You,"I'm a fool to want you 
 I'm a fool to want you 
 To want a love that can't be true 
 A love that's there for others too 
 I'm a fool to hold you 
 Such a fool to hold you 
 To seek a kiss not mine alone 
 To share a kiss that the devil has known 
 Time and time again I said I'd leave you 
 Time and time again I went away 
 But then would come a time when I would need you 
 And once again these words I had to say 
 I'm a fool to want you 
 Pity me, I need you 
 I know it's wrong, it must be wrong 
 But right or wrong I can't get along, without you 
 Time and time again I said I'd leave you 
 Time and time again I went away 
 But then would come a time when I would need you 
 And once again these words I have to say 
 Take me back, I love you 
 Pity me, I need you 
 I know it's wrong, it must be wrong 
 But right or wrong I can't get along, without you"
384,Bob Dylan,rock,The Night We Called It A Day,"There was a moon out in space 
 But a cloud drifted over it's face 
 You kissed me and went on your way 
 The night we called it a day 
 I heard the song of the spheres 
 Like a minor lament in my ears 
 I hadn't the heart left to pray 
 The night we called it a day 
 Soft through the dark 
 The hoot of an owl in the sky 
 Sad though his song 
 No bluer than he was I 
 The moon went down stars were gone 
 But the sun didn't rise with the dawn 
 There wasn't a thing left to say 
 The night we called it a day 
 Soft through the dark 
 The hoot of an owl in the sky 
 Sad though his song 
 No bluer than he was I 
 The moon went down stars were gone 
 But the sun didn't rise with the dawn 
 There wasn't a thing left to say 
 The night we called it a day"
385,Bob Dylan,rock,Stay With Me,"Should my heart not be humble 
 Should my eyes fail to see 
 Should my feet sometimes stumble 
 On the way, stay with me 
 Like the lamb that in springtime 
 Wanders far from the fold 
 Comes the darkness and the frost 
 I get lost 
 I grow cold 
 I grow cold, I grow weary 
 And I know I have sinned 
 And I go, seeking shelter 
 And I cry in the wind 
 Though I grope and I blunder 
 And I'm weak and I'm wrong 
 Though the road buckles under 
 Where I walk, walk along 
 Till I find to my wonder 
 Every path leads to Thee 
 All that I can do is pray 
 Stay with me 
 Stay with me"
386,Bob Dylan,rock,Autumn Leaves,"The falling leaves 
 Drift by the window 
 The autumn leaves 
 Of red and gold 
 I see your lips 
 The summer kisses 
 The sunburned hands 
 I used to hold 
 Since you went away 
 The days grow long 
 And soon I'll hear 
 Old winter's song 
 But I miss you most of all 
 My darling 
 When autumn leaves 
 Start to fall"
387,Bob Dylan,rock,Why Try To Change Me Now,"I'm sentimental 
 So I walk in the rain 
 I've got some habits 
 Even I can't explain 
 Could start for the corner 
 Turn up in Spain 
 Why try to change me now? 
 I sit and daydream 
 I've got daydreams galore 
 Cigarette ashes 
 There they go on the floor 
 I go away weekends 
 And leave my keys in the door 
 But why try to change me now? 
 Why can't I be more conventional 
 People talk, people stare, so I try 
 But that's not for me, cause I can't see 
 My kind of crazy world go passing me by 
 So let people wonder 
 Let 'em laugh, let 'em frown 
 You know I'll love you 
 Till the moon's upside down 
 Don't you remember 
 I was always your clown 
 Why try to change me now? 
 Don't you remember 
 I was always your clown 
 But why try to change me? 
 Why try to change me now?"
388,Bob Dylan,rock,Some Enchanted Evening,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger 
 You may see a stranger across a crowded room 
 And somehow you know, you know even then 
 That somehow you'll see her again and again 
 Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing 
 You may hear her laughing across a crowded room 
 And night after night, as strange as it seems 
 The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams 
 Who can explain it, who can tell you why? 
 Fools give you reasons, wise men never try 
 Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love 
 When you feel her call you across a crowded room 
 Then fly to her side and make her your own 
 Or all through your life you may dream all alone 
 Once that you found her, never let her go 
 Once you have found her, never let her go"
389,Bob Dylan,rock,Full Moon And Empty Arms,"Full moon and empty arms 
 The moon is there for us to share 
 But where are you? 
 A night like this 
 Could weave a memory 
 And every kiss 
 Could start a dream for two 
 Full moon and empty arms 
 Tonight I'll use the magic moon to wish upon 
 And next full moon 
 If my one wish comes true 
 My empty arms will be filled with you 
 Full moon and empty arms 
 Tonight I'll use the magic moon to wish upon 
 And next full moon 
 If my one wish comes true 
 My empty arms will be filled with you"
390,Bob Dylan,rock,Where Are You,"Where are you 
 Where have you gone without me 
 I thought you cared about me 
 Where are you 
 Where's my heart 
 Where is the dream we started 
 I can't believe we're parted 
 Where are you 
 When we said good-bye love 
 What had we to gain 
 When I gave you my love 
 Was it all in vain 
 All life through 
 Must I go on pretending 
 Where is my happy ending 
 Where are you 
 When we said good-bye love 
 What had we to gain 
 When I gave you my love 
 Was it all in vain 
 All life through 
 Must I go on pretending 
 Where is that happy ending 
 Where are you 
 Where are you"
391,Bob Dylan,rock,What'll I Do,"What'll I do 
 When you are far away 
 And I am blue 
 What'll I do? 
 What'll I do 
 When I am wondering who 
 Is kissing you 
 What'll I do? 
 What'll I do 
 With just a photograph 
 To tell my troubles to? 
 When I'm alone 
 With only dreams of you 
 That won't come true 
 What'll I do? 
 What'll I do 
 With just a photograph 
 To tell my troubles to? 
 When I'm alone 
 With only dreams of you 
 That won't come true 
 What'll I do?"
392,Bob Dylan,rock,That Lucky Old Sun,"Up in the mornin', out on the job 
 Work like the devil for my pay 
 But that lucky old sun has nothin' to do 
 But roll around heaven all day 
 Fuss with my woman, toil for my kids 
 Sweat till I'm wrinkled and gray 
 While that lucky old sun has nothin' to do 
 But roll around heaven all day 
 Good Lord above, can't you see I'm pining 
 Tears in my eyes 
 Send down that cloud with a silver lining 
 Lift me to paradise 
 Show me that river, take me across 
 And wash all my troubles away 
 Like that lucky old sun, give me nothin' to do 
 But roll around heaven all day 
 Oh Lord above, can't you know I'm pining 
 Tears in my eyes 
 Send down that cloud with a silver lining 
 Lift me to paradise 
 Show me that river, take me across 
 And wash all my troubles away 
 Like that lucky old sun, give me nothin' to do 
 But roll around heaven all day"
393,Bob Dylan,rock,Young At Heart,"Fairy tales can come true, it can happen to you 
 If you're young at heart 
 For it's hard, you will find, to be narrow of mind 
 If you're young at heart 
 You can go to extremes with impossible schemes 
 You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams 
 And life gets more exciting with each passing day 
 And love is either in your heart, or on it's way 
 Don't you know that it's worth every treasure on earth 
 To be young at heart 
 For as rich as you are, it's much better by far 
 To be young at heart 
 And if you should survive to 105 
 Look at all you'll derive out of being alive 
 And here is the best part, you have a head start 
 If you are among the very young at heart 
 And if you should survive to 105 
 Look at all you'll derive out of being alive 
 And here is the best part, you have a head start 
 If you are among the very young at heart"
394,Bob Dylan,rock,Maybe You'll Be There,"Each time I see a crowd of people 
 Just like a fool I stop and stare 
 It's really not the proper thing to do 
 But maybe you'll be there 
 I go out walking after midnight 
 Along the lonely thoroughfare 
 It's not the time or place to look for you 
 But maybe you'll be there 
 You said your arms would always hold me 
 You said your lips were mine alone to kiss 
 Now after all those things you told me 
 How can it end like this 
 Someday if all my prayers are answered 
 I'll hear a footstep on the stair 
 With anxious heart I'll hurry to the door 
 And maybe you'll be there"
395,Bob Dylan,rock,Polka Dots And Moonbeams,"A country dance was being held in a garden 
 I felt a bump and heard an, ""Oh, beg your pardon"" 
 Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams 
 All around a pug-nosed dream 
 The music started and was I the perplexed one 
 I held my breath and said, ""May I have the next one?"" 
 In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams 
 Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream 
 There were questions in the eyes of other dancers 
 As we floated over the floor 
 There were questions but my heart knew all the answers 
 And perhaps a few things more 
 Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter 
 I know the meaning of the words, ""Ever after"" 
 And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams 
 When I kiss the pug-nosed dream"
396,Bob Dylan,rock,All The Way,"When somebody loves you 
 It's no good unless he loves you all the way 
 Happy to be near you 
 When you need someone to cheer you all the way 
 Taller than the tallest tree is 
 That's how it's got to feel 
 Deeper than the deep blue sea is 
 That's how deep it goes if it's real 
 When somebody needs you 
 It's no good unless she needs you all the way 
 Through the good or lean years 
 And for all those in-between years come what may 
 Who knows where the road will lead us 
 Only a fool would say 
 But if you'll let me love you 
 It's for sure I'm gonna love you all the way, all the way 
 And when somebody needs you 
 It's no good unless she needs you all the way 
 And through the good or lean years 
 And for all those in-between years come what may 
 Who knows where the road will lead us 
 Only a fool would say 
 But if you'll let me love you 
 It's for sure I'm gonna love you all the way, all the way"
397,Bob Dylan,rock,Skylark,"Skylark 
 Have you anything to say to me 
 Won't you tell me where my love can be 
 Is there a meadow in the mist 
 Where someone's waiting to be kissed 
 Skylark 
 Have you seen a valley green with spring 
 Where my heart can go a-journeying 
 Over the shadows and the rain 
 To a blossom covered lane 
 And in your lonely flight 
 Haven't you heard the music of the night 
 Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp 
 Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon 
 Oh, Skylark 
 I don't know if you can find these things 
 But my heart is riding on your wings 
 So if you see them anywhere 
 Won't you lead me there"
398,Bob Dylan,rock,Nevertheless,"Maybe I'm right and maybe I'm wrong 
 Maybe I'm weak and maybe I'm strong 
 But nevertheless I'm in love with you 
 Maybe I'll win and maybe I'll lose 
 And maybe I'm in for crying the blues 
 But nevertheless I'm in love with you 
 Somehow, I know at a glance 
 The terrible chances I'm taking 
 Fine at the start 
 Then left with a heart that is breaking 
 Maybe I'll live the life of regret 
 And maybe I'll give much more than I'll get 
 But nevertheless I'm in love with you 
 Maybe I'll live the life of regret 
 And maybe I'll give much more than I'll get 
 But nevertheless I'm in love with you"
399,Bob Dylan,rock,All Or Nothing At All,"All or nothing at all 
 Half a love never appealed to me 
 If your heart never could yield to me 
 Then I'd rather have nothing at all 
 All or nothing at all 
 If it's love there is no in-between 
 Why begin then cry for something that might have been 
 No I'd rather have nothing at all 
 Please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek 
 Don't smile, I'll be lost beyond recall 
 The kiss in your eyes and the touch of your hand makes me weak 
 And my heart may grow dizzy and fall 
 And if I fell under the spell of your call 
 I would be caught in the undertow 
 And so you see, I've got to say ""No, no"" 
 All or nothing at all 
 All or nothing at all"
400,Bob Dylan,rock,On A Little Street In Singapore,"On a little street in Singapore 
 We'd meet beside a lotus-covered door 
 A veil of moonlight on her lonely face 
 How pale the hands that held me in embrace 
 My sails tonight are filled with perfume of Shalimar 
 And temple bells will guide me to the shore 
 And then I'll hold her in my arms and love the way I loved before 
 On a little street in Singapore"
401,Bob Dylan,rock,It Had To Be You,"Why do I do just as you say 
 Why must I just give you your way 
 Why do I sigh, why don't I try to forget 
 It must have been that something lovers call fate 
 Kept me saying, ""I have to wait"" 
 I saw them all, just couldn't fall till we met 
 It had to be you, it had to be you 
 I wandered around and finally found the somebody who 
 Could make me be true, could make me be blue 
 And even be glad, just to be sad thinking of you 
 Some others I've seen might never be mean 
 Might never be cross or try to be boss but they wouldn't do 
 For nobody else gave me a thrill, with all your faults I love you still 
 It had to be you, wonderful you, it had to be you 
 For nobody else gave me a thrill, with all your faults I love you still 
 It had to be you, wonderful you, it had to be you"
402,Bob Dylan,rock,Melancholy Mood,"Melancholy mood forever haunts me 
 Steals upon me in the night, forever taunts me 
 Oh, what a lonely soul am I 
 Stranded high and dry by a melancholy mood 
 Gone is every joy and inspiration 
 Tears are all I have to show, no consolation 
 All I can see is grief and gloom 
 Till the crack of doom, oh melancholy mood 
 Deep in the night I search for a trace 
 Of a lingering kiss, a warm embrace 
 But love is a whimsy and flimsy as lace 
 And my arms embrace an empty space 
 Melancholy mood, why must you blind me 
 Pity me and break the chains 
 The chains that bind me 
 Won't you release me, set me free 
 Bring her back to me, oh melancholy mood"
403,Bob Dylan,rock,That Old Black Magic,"That old black magic has weaved its spell 
 That old black magic that you weave so well 
 Those icy fingers up and down my spine 
 Same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine 
 Same old tingle that I feel inside 
 And then that elevator starts its ride 
 And down and down I go, round and round I go 
 Like a leaf caught in the tide 
 I should stay away but what can I do? 
 I hear your name and I'm aflame 
 Aflame with burning desire 
 That only your kiss can put out the fire 
 You're the lover I have waited for 
 You're the mate that fate had me created for 
 And every time your lips meet mine 
 Baby down and down I go, round and round I go 
 In a spin, loving the spin I'm in 
 Under that old black magic called love 
 In a spin, loving the spin I'm in 
 Under that old black magic called love 
 In a spin, loving the spin I'm in 
 Under that old black magic called love 
 I should stay away but what can I do? 
 I hear your name and I'm aflame 
 Aflame with burning desire 
 That only your kiss can put out the fire 
 For you're the lover I have waited for 
 You're the mate that fate had me created for 
 And every time your lips meet mine 
 Baby down and down I go, round and round I go 
 In a spin, loving the spin I'm in 
 I'm under that old black magic called love 
 Oh in a spin, loving the spin I'm in 
 Under that old black magic called love 
 In a spin, loving the spin I'm in 
 Under that old black magic called love 
 Under that old black magic called love"
404,Bob Dylan,rock,Come Rain Or Come Shine,"I'm gonna love you like nobody's loved you 
 Come rain or come shine 
 High as a mountain and deep as a river 
 Come rain or come shine 
 I guess when you met me 
 It was just one of those things 
 But don't ever bet me 
 'Cause I'm gon' be true if you let me 
 You're gonna love me like nobody's loved me 
 Come rain or come shine 
 Happy together, unhappy together 
 And won't that be fine? 
 Days may be cloudy or sunny 
 We're in or we're out of the money 
 But I'm with you always 
 I'm with you rain or shine"
405,Bob Dylan,rock,I Guess I'll Have To Change My Plans,"I guess I'll have to change my plan 
 I should have realized there'd be another man 
 I overlooked that point completely 
 Until the big affair began 
 Before I knew where I was at 
 I found myself upon the shelf and that was that 
 I tried to reach the moon but when I got there 
 All that I could get was the air 
 My feet are back upon the ground 
 I lost the one girl I've found 
 I guess I'll have to change my plan 
 I should have realized there'd be another man 
 Why did I buy those blue pyjamas 
 Before that big affair began? 
 My boiling point is much too low 
 For me to try to be a fly Lothario 
 I think I'll crawl right back and into my shell 
 Dwelling in my personal hell 
 I'll have to change my plan around 
 I've lost the one girl that I've found 
 Yes, the one girl, the one girl that I've found"
406,Bob Dylan,rock,September Of My Years,"One day you turn around and it's summer 
 Next day you turn around and it's fall 
 And the springs and the winters of a lifetime 
 Whatever happened to them all? 
 As a man who has always had the wand'ring ways 
 Now I'm reaching back for yesterdays 
 'Til a long-forgotten love appears 
 And I find that I'm sighing softly as I near 
 September, the warm September of my years 
 As I man who has never paused at wishing wells 
 Now I'm watching children's carousels 
 And their laughter's music to my ears 
 And I find that I'm smiling gently as I near 
 September, the warm September of my years 
 The golden warm September of my years"
407,Bob Dylan,rock,I Could Have Told You,"I could have told you she'd hurt you 
 She'd love you a while then desert you 
 If only you'd asked, I could have told you so 
 I could have saved you some crying 
 Yes, I could have told you she's lying 
 But you were in love 
 And didn't want to know 
 I hear her now 
 As I toss and turn and try to sleep 
 I hear her now 
 Making promises she'll never keep 
 And soon it's over and done with 
 She'll find someone new to have fun with 
 Through all of my tears, I could have told you so 
 I hear her now 
 As I toss and turn and try to sleep 
 I hear her now 
 Making promises she'll never keep 
 And soon it's over and done with 
 She'll find someone new to have fun with 
 Through all of my tears, I could have told you so"
408,Bob Dylan,rock,Once Upon A Time,"Once upon a time a girl with moonlight in her eyes 
 Put her hand in mine and said she loved me so 
 But that was once upon a time very long ago 
 Once upon a hill we sat beneath a willow tree 
 Counting all the stars and waiting for the dawn 
 But that was once upon a time, now the tree is gone 
 How the breeze ruffled through the hair 
 How we always laughed as though tomorrow wasn't there 
 We were young and didn't have a care, where did it go? 
 Once upon a time the world was sweeter than we knew 
 Everything was ours, how happy we were then 
 But somehow once upon a time never comes again 
 Once upon a time never comes again"
409,Bob Dylan,rock,Stormy Weather,"Don't know why there's no sun up in the sky 
 Stormy weather since my gal and I ain't together 
 Keeps raining all the time 
 Life is bare, gloom and misery everywhere 
 Stormy weather, just can't get my poor old self together 
 I'm weary all the time, the time 
 So weary all of the time 
 When she went away the blues walked in and met me 
 If she stays away that old rocking chair's bound to get me 
 All I do is pray the Lord above will let me 
 A-just walk in that sun once more 
 Can't go on, everything I had is gone 
 Stormy weather since my gal and I ain't together 
 Keeps raining all the time 
 Keeps raining all of the time"
410,Bob Dylan,rock,This Nearly Was Mine,"One dream in my heart, one love to be living for 
 One love to be living for, this nearly was mine 
 One girl for my dream, one partner in paradise 
 This promise of paradise, this nearly was mine 
 Close to my heart she came, only to fly away 
 Only to fly as day flies from moonlight 
 Now, now I'm alone, still dreaming of paradise 
 Still saying that paradise once nearly was mine"
411,Bob Dylan,rock,That Old Feeling,"I saw you last night and got that old feeling 
 When you came in sight, I got that old feeling 
 The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill 
 And when you caught my eye my heart stood still 
 Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning 
 And I knew the spark of love was still burning 
 There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start 
 For that old, old feeling is still in my heart 
 There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start 
 For that old, old feeling is still in my heart"
412,Bob Dylan,rock,It Gets Lonely Early,"When you're all alone 
 All the children grown 
 And, like starlings, flown away 
 It gets lonely early, doesn't it? 
 Lonely early, doesn't it? 
 Ev'ry single endless day 
 When your twilight nears 
 And one face appears 
 Turning winter years to May 
 It gets lonely early, doesn't it? 
 Lonely early, doesn't it? 
 Still the old heart's young enough to say 
 ""It was really more than lovely, wasn't it?"" 
 ""Truly lovely, wasn't it?"" 
 Ev'ry single lovely day"
413,Bob Dylan,rock,My One And Only Love,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing 
 Like an April breeze on the wings of spring 
 And you appear in all your splendor 
 My one and only love 
 The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms 
 In the hush of night while you're in my arms 
 I feel your lips so warm and tender 
 My one and only love 
 The touch of your hand is like heaven 
 A heaven that I've never known 
 And the blush of your cheek whenever I speak 
 Tells me that you are my own 
 You fill my eager heart with such desire 
 Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire 
 I give myself in sweet surrender 
 My one and only love 
 The touch of your hand is like heaven 
 A heaven that I've never known 
 And the blush of your cheek whenever I speak 
 Tells me that you are my own 
 You fill my eager heart with such desire 
 Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire 
 I give myself in sweet surrender 
 My one and only love"
414,Bob Dylan,rock,Trade Winds,"Down where the trade winds play 
 Down where you lose the day 
 We found a new world where paradise starts 
 We traded hearts way down where the trade winds play 
 Music was everywhere, flowers were in her hair 
 Under an awning of silvery boughs 
 We traded vows the night that I sailed away 
 Oh trade winds, what are vows that lovers make 
 Oh trade winds, are they only made to break 
 When it is May again 
 I'll sail away again 
 Though I'm returning, it won't be the same 
 She traded her name way down where the trade winds play"
415,Bob Dylan,rock,Braggin',"Braggin' 
 Wastin' all your time just braggin' 
 When ya' should be busy 
 Plowin' and a'plantin' 
 You stand there a'rantin' 
 Get no harvest till your heart 
 Braggin' 
 You ain't got no cause for braggin' 
 When your barn needs mendin' 
 And your lawn needs mowin' 
 How come you're a crowin' 
 Like a no-good rooster at dawn 
 Braggin' 'bout your fishin' 
 'Bout your horseshoe pitchin' 
 Bet you always keep the score 
 Talkin' 'bout your meddle 
 That's the kind they peddle 
 Down at the 5 and 10 cents store 
 Braggin' 
 Folks ain't got no use for braggin' 
 If your fields are greener 
 Folks will hear about it 
 You don't hafta shout it 
 Fields were green before you were born 
 Braggin' 'bout your fishin' 
 'Bout your horseshoe pitchin' 
 Bet you always keep the score 
 Talkin' 'bout your meddle 
 That's the kind they peddle 
 Down at the 5 and 10 cents store 
 Braggin' 
 Folks ain't got no use for braggin' 
 If your fields are greener 
 Folks will hear about it 
 You don't hafta shout it 
 Fields were green before you were born"
416,Bob Dylan,rock,As Time Goes By,"You must remember this 
 A kiss is still a kiss 
 A sigh is just a sigh 
 The fundamental things apply 
 As time goes by 
 And when two lovers woe 
 They still say, ""I love you"" 
 On that you can rely 
 No matter what the future brings 
 As time goes by 
 Moonlight and love songs never out of date 
 Hearts full of passion, jealousy, and hate 
 Woman needs man and man must have his mate 
 That no one can deny 
 It's still the same old story 
 A fight for love and glory 
 A case of do or die 
 The world will always welcome lovers 
 As time goes by 
 It's still the same old story 
 A fight for love and glory 
 A case of do or die 
 The world will always welcome lovers 
 As time goes by"
417,Bob Dylan,rock,Imagination,"Imagination is funny 
 It makes a cloudy day sunny 
 Makes a bee think of honey 
 Just as I think of you 
 Imagination is crazy 
 Your whole perspective gets hazy 
 Starts you asking a daisy 
 What to do, what to do 
 Have you ever felt a gentle touch 
 And then a kiss, and then and then 
 Find it's only your imagination again, oh well 
 Imagination is silly 
 You go around willy-nilly 
 For example I go around wanting you 
 And yet I can't imagine that you want me too"
418,Bob Dylan,rock,How Deep Is The Ocean,"How much do I love you, I'll tell you no lie 
 How deep is the ocean, how high is the sky? 
 How many times a day do I think of you? 
 How many roses are sprinkled with dew? 
 How far would I travel to be where you are? 
 How far is the journey from here to a star? 
 And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry? 
 How deep is the ocean, how high is the sky? 
 And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry? 
 How deep is the ocean, how high is the sky?"
419,Bob Dylan,rock,P.S. I Love You,"What is there to write? 
 What is there to say? 
 The same things happen everyday 
 Not a thing to write, not a thing to say 
 So I take my pen in hand and start the same old way 
 Dear, I thought I'd drop a line 
 The weather's cool, the folks are fine 
 I'm in bed each night at nine 
 P.S. I love you 
 Yesterday we had some rain 
 But all in all I can't complain 
 Was it dusty on the train? 
 P.S. I love you 
 Write to the Browns just as soon as you're able 
 They came around to call 
 And I burned a hole in the dining room table 
 And let me see, I guess that's all 
 Nothing else for me to say 
 And so I'll close, but by the way 
 Everybody's thinkin' of you 
 P.S. I love you 
 I do my best to obey all your wishes 
 I put a sign up, ""Think"" 
 But I got to buy us a new set of dishes 
 Or wash the ones that have piled in the sink 
 Nothing else to tell you, dear 
 'Cept each day seems like a year 
 Every night I'm dreamin' of you 
 P.S. I love you"
420,Bob Dylan,rock,The Best Is Yet To Come,"Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum 
 You came along and everything started to hum 
 Still it's a real good bet the best is yet to come 
 The best is yet to come and, babe, won't that be fine? 
 You think you've seen the sun but you ain't seen it shine 
 Wait till the warm-up's underway 
 Wait till our lips have met 
 And wait till you see that sunshine day 
 You ain't seen nothin' yet 
 The best is yet to come and, babe, won't it be fine? 
 The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine 
 Come the day you're mine, I'm gonna teach you to fly 
 We've only tasted the wine 
 We're gonna drain the cup dry 
 Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround 
 You think you've flown before but baby you ain't left the ground 
 Wait till you're locked in my embrace 
 Wait till I draw you near 
 Wait till you see that sunshine place 
 Ain't nothin' like it here 
 The best is yet to come and, babe, won't it be fine 
 The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine 
 Come the day you're mine, and you're gon' be mine"
421,Bob Dylan,rock,But Beautiful,"Love is funny or it's sad 
 Or it's quiet or it's mad 
 It's a good thing or it's bad 
 But beautiful 
 Beautiful to take a chance and if you fall, you fall 
 And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all 
 Love is tearful or it's gay 
 It's a problem or it's play 
 It's a heartache either way 
 But beautiful 
 And I'm thinking if you were mine, I'd never let you go 
 And that would be but beautiful, I know 
 Love is tearful or it's gay 
 It's a problem or it's play 
 It's a heartache either way 
 But it's beautiful 
 And I'm thinking if you were mine, I'd never let you go 
 And that would be but beautiful, I know"
422,Bob Dylan,rock,Here's That Rainy Day,"Maybe I should have saved those leftover dreams 
 Funny but here's that rainy day 
 Here's that rainy day they told me about 
 And I laughed at the thought 
 That it might turn out this way 
 Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside 
 After it brought my love so near 
 Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day 
 Funny that rainy day is here 
 It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day 
 Funny that rainy day is here"
423,Bob Dylan,rock,Where Is The One,"Where is the one who'll end the search I'm making 
 Where is the one who'll change my dream to waking 
 Behind some far off secret door there's my love 
 There's my life in store 
 The journey's long, much longer than I reckoned 
 In any throng I'll know her in a second 
 Some lucky day I'm bound to find her 
 And when I do I'll find love 
 The journey's long, much longer than I reckoned 
 In any throng I'll know her in a second 
 Some lucky day I'm bound to find her 
 And when I do I'll find love"
424,Bob Dylan,rock,There's A Flaw In My Flue,"I used to sit by my fireplace 
 And dream about you 
 But now that won't do 
 There's a flaw in my flue 
 Your lovely face in my fireplace 
 Was all that I saw 
 But now it won't draw 
 'Cause my flue has a flaw 
 From every beautiful ember a memory arose 
 Now I try to remember and smoke gets in my nose 
 It's not as sweet by the unit-heat 
 To dream about you 
 So darling, adieu 
 There's a flaw in my flue"
425,Bob Dylan,rock,"Day In, Day Out","Day in, day out 
 The same old voodoo follows me about 
 The same old pounding in my heart whenever I think of you 
 And darling, I think of you, day in and day out 
 Day out, day in 
 I needn't tell you how my day begin 
 When I awake I awake with a tingle, one possibility in view 
 That possibility of maybe seeing you 
 Come rain, come shine 
 I meet you and to me the day is fine 
 Then I kiss your lips and the pounding becomes 
 The oceans roar, a thousand drums 
 But can't you see it's love 
 Can there be any doubt 
 When there it is 
 Day in and day out 
 Come rain, come shine 
 I meet you and to me the day is fine 
 Then I kiss those lips and the pounding becomes 
 Large ocean roar, nine thousand drums 
 Can't you see that it's love 
 Can there be any doubt 
 When there it is 
 And here it is 
 When there it is 
 Day in and day out"
426,Bob Dylan,rock,I Couldn't Sleep A Wink Last Night,"I couldn't sleep a wink last night 
 Because we had that silly fight 
 I thought my heart would break the whole night through 
 I knew that you'd be sorry 
 And I'm sorry too 
 I didn't have my favorite dream 
 The one in which I hold you tight 
 I had to call you up this morning 
 To see if everything was still all right 
 Yes, I had to call you up this morning 
 'Cause I couldn't sleep a wink last night 
 I didn't have my favorite dream 
 The one in which I hold you tight 
 I had to call you up this morning 
 To see if everything was still all right 
 Yes, I had to call you up this morning 
 'Cause I couldn't sleep a wink last night"
427,Bob Dylan,rock,Sentimental Journey,"Gonna take a sentimental journey 
 Gonna set my heart at ease 
 Gonna make a sentimental journey 
 To renew old memories 
 I got my bag, I got my reservation 
 Spent each dime I could afford 
 Like a child in wild anticipation 
 I long to hear that, ""All aboard!"" 
 Seven, that's the time we leave at seven 
 I'll be waiting up for wide heaven 
 Counting every mile of railroad track, that moves me back 
 I never though my heart could be so yearnin' 
 Why did I decide to roam 
 Gotta take a sentimental journey 
 Sentimental journey home 
 Gotta take a sentimental journey 
 Sentimental journey home"
428,Bob Dylan,rock,Somewhere Along The Way,"I used to walk with you 
 Along the avenue 
 Our hearts were carefree and gay 
 How could I know I'd lose you 
 Somewhere along the way? 
 The friends we used to know 
 Would always smile, ""Hello"" 
 No love like our love they'd say 
 Then love slipped through our fingers 
 Somewhere along the way 
 I should forget 
 But with the loneliness of night 
 I start remembering ev'rything 
 You're gone and yet 
 There's still a feeling deep inside 
 That you will always be part of me 
 So now I look for you 
 Along the avenue 
 And as I wander I pray 
 That some day soon I'll find you 
 Somewhere along the way 
 That some day soon I'll find you 
 Somewhere along the way 
 Somewhere along the way"
429,Bob Dylan,rock,When The World Was Young,"It isn't by chance I happen to be 
 A boulevardier, the toast of Paris 
 For over the noise, the talk and the smoke 
 I'm good for a laugh, a drink or a joke 
 I walk in a room, a party or ball 
 ""Come sit over here"", somebody will call 
 ""A drink for M'sieur, a drink for us all!"" 
 But how many times I stop and recall 
 Ah, the apple trees 
 Blossoms in the breeze 
 That we walked among 
 Lying in the hay 
 Games we used to play 
 While the rounds were sung 
 Only yesterday when the world was young 
 Wherever I go they mention my name 
 And that in itself, is some sort of fame 
 ""Come by for a drink, we're having a game"" 
 Wherever I go I'm glad that I came 
 The talk is quite gay, the company fine 
 There's laughter and lights, and glamour and wine 
 And beautiful girls and some of them mine 
 But often my eyes see a different shine 
 Ah, the apple trees 
 Sunlit memories 
 Where the hammock swung 
 On our backs we'd lie 
 Looking at the sky 
 Till the stars were strung 
 Only last July when the world was young"
430,Bob Dylan,rock,These Foolish Things,"A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces 
 An airline ticket to romantic places 
 And still my heart has wings 
 These foolish things remind me of you 
 A tinkling piano in the next apartment 
 Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant 
 A fairground's painted swings 
 These foolish things remind me of you 
 You came, you saw, you conquered me 
 When you did that to me 
 I knew somehow this had to be 
 The winds of March that make my heart a dancer 
 A telephone that rings but who's to answer? 
 Oh, how the ghost of you clings 
 These foolish things remind me of you 
 The winds of March that make my heart a dancer 
 A telephone that rings but who's to answer? 
 Oh, how the ghost of you clings 
 These foolish things remind me of you"

 random page 
 ?"
432,Bob Dylan,rock,Stardust,"Sometimes I wonder why I spend 
 My lonely nights dreamin' of a song 
 The melody haunts my reverie 
 And I am once again with you 
 When our love was new 
 And each kiss an inspiration 
 Oh, but that was long ago 
 And now my consolation 
 Is in the stardust of a song 
 Beside a garden wall 
 When stars were bright 
 You were in my arms 
 The nightingale told its fairytale 
 Of paradise where roses bloom 
 Though I dream in vain 
 In my heart it'll always remain 
 My stardust melody 
 The memory of love's refrain"
433,Bob Dylan,rock,It's Funny To Everyone But Me,"It's funny how you loved me 
 Then forgot so suddenly 
 It's funny to everyone but me 
 They told me this would happen 
 Now they're laughing secretly 
 It's funny to everyone but me 
 I should shrug my shoulders and say 
 ""Good riddance to a bad affair"" 
 But how can I do what my head tells me to 
 When my heart tells me how much I care 
 It's so funny, I still love you 
 It's the joke of the century 
 It's funny to everyone but me 
 It's so funny, I still love you 
 It's the joke of the century 
 Ah, but it's funny to everyone but me"
434,Bob Dylan,rock,Why Was I Born,"Why was I born, why am I living 
 What do I get, what am I giving 
 Why do I want a thing I dare and hope for 
 What can I hope for, I wish I knew 
 Why do I try to draw you near me 
 Why do I cry, you never hear me 
 I'm a poor fool but what can I do 
 Why was I born to love you 
 I'm a poor fool but what can I do 
 Why was I born to love you"

 Early on one frosty morn 
 Look away, look away, look away to Dixie Land

 ""Hello"" every day, 
 Hitting the hard old dusty way to the California line 
 Across that desert sand they go 
 They're getting out of the old dust bowl 
 They think they're going to a sugar bowl 
 But here is what they find 
 Oh the police at the port of entry say, 
 ""You're number fourteen thousand for today"" 
 And, well if you ain't got the do re mi, boy 
 If you ain't got the do re mi 
 Better go on back to beautiful Texas, 
 Oklahoma, Kansas, Georgia, Tennessee. 
 California is the garden of eden 
 A paradise to live in or see 
 But believe it or not 
 You won't find it so hot 
 If you ain't got the do re mi. 
 If you want a house or farm 
 That won't do nobody harm 
 Take your vacation by the mountains or the sea. 
 Don't swap that old cow for a car 
 Better stay right where you are 
 You had better take this tip from me. 
 'Cause I read it in the want ads every day 
 And the headlines on the papers always say 
 If you ain't got the do re mi, boy 
 If you ain't got the do re mi 
 Better go on back to beautiful Texas, 
 Oklahoma, Kansas, Georgia, Tennessee.

438,Bob Dylan,rock,I'm Not There,"Things are crashing down 
 She's all too tight 
 In my neighborhood 
 She cried both day and night 
 I know it because it was there 
 It's a milestone 
 But she's down on her luck 
 And the day makes her lonely 
 But to make it hard to buck, now and then 
 I believe that she'd stop him 
 If she would start to care 
 I believe that she'd look upon 
 His side that used to care 
 And I'd go by the Lord 
 Anywhere she's on my way 
 But I don't belong there 
 No I don't belong to her 
 I don't belong to any body 
 She's my Christ-forsaken angel 
 But she don't hear me cry 
 She's a lone-hearted mystic 
 And she can't carry on 
 When I'm there, she's all right 
 But she's not when I'm gone 
 Heaven knows that the answer 
 She don't calling no one 
 She's the way, forsaken beauty 
 For she's mine, for the one 
 And I lost her, hesitation 
 By temptation as it runs 
 But she don't holler me 
 But I'm not there, I'm gone 
 Now I'll cry tonight 
 Like I cried the night before 
 And I'm knees on the hassle 
 But I'll dream about the door 
 It's so long, she's forsaken 
 By her faith, worse to tell 
 It don't have contonation 
 She smiles, fare thee well 
 Now when I treat to leave 'er 
 I was born to love her 
 But she knows that the kingdom awaits 
 So high above her 
 And I run a better race 
 But it's not too fast still 
 But I don't perceive her 
 I'm not there, I'm gone 
 Well it's all about diffusion 
 And I cry for her veil 
 I don't need anybody now 
 Beside me to tell 
 And it's all affirmation 
 I receive but it's not 
 She's a lone-hearted beauty 
 But she's gone like a spark 
 And she calls 
 Yeah, she's gone like the rain 
 Below the shining yesterday 
 But now she's home beside me 
 And I'd like her here to stay 
 She's a lone, forsaken beauty 
 And it don't trust anyone 
 And I wish I was beside her 
 But I'm not there, I'm gone 
 Well, it's too hard to stay here 
 And I don't want to leave 
 It's so bad, for so few 
 See, but she's a heart too hard to need 
 It's alone, it's a crime 
 The way she mauls me around 
 But she don't fall to hate me 
 But tears are gone, a painted clown 
 Yes, I believe that it's rightful 
 Oh, I believe it in my mind 
 I've been told like I said one night before 
 Carry on the cryin' 
 And the sole gypsy told her 
 Like I said, carry on 
 I wish I was there to help her 
 But I'm not there, I'm gone"
439,Bob Dylan,rock,Night After Night,"Night after night, you wander the streets of my mind 
 Night after night, don't know what you think you will find 
 No place to go, nowhere to turn 
 Everything around you seems to burn, burn, burn 
 And there's never any mercy in sight, night after night 
 Night after night 
 Night after night 
 Night after night, some new plan to blow up the world 
 Night after night, another old man kissing some young girl 
 You look for salvation, you find none 
 Just another broken heart, another barrel of a gun 
 Just another stick of dynamite, night after night 
 Night after night 
 Night after night 
 Night after night, you drop dead in your bed 
 Night after night, another bottle finds a head 
 Night after night, I think about cutting you loose 
 But I just can't do it, what would be the use? 
 So I just keep a-holding you tight, night after night 
 Night after night after night after night after night 
 Night after night after night after night after night 
 Night after night after night after night after night 
 Night after night after night after night after night"
440,Bob Dylan,rock,Ring Of Fire,"Love is a burning thing, 
 Can change into a firy ring. 
 Bound for wild desire 
 I fell into a ring of fire. 
 I fell into a burning ring of fire. 
 I went down down down 
 And the flames went higher. 
 And it burns burns burns, 
 That ring of fire, 
 That ring of fire. 
 They say that love is sweet 
 When hearts like ours meet. 
 I fell for you like a child. 
 Oh but the fire went wild. 
 I fell into a burning ring of fire. 
 I went down down down 
 And the flames went higher. 
 And it burns burns burns, 
 That ring of fire, 
 That ring of fire. 
 I fell into a burning ring of fire. 
 I went down down down 
 And the flames went higher. 
 And it burns burns burns, 
 That ring of fire, 
 That ring of fire. 
 I fell into a burning ring of fire. 
 I went down down down 
 And the flames they went higher. 
 And it burns burns burns, 
 That ring of fire, 
 That ring of fire. 
 And it burns burns burns, 
 That ring of fire, 
 That ring of fire."
441,Bob Dylan,rock,The Usual,"I'm trippin' over dumb drunks at a party 
 Girlfriend just ran off with the DJ 
 I give her everything, but she refused it 
 It doesn't matter, she don't know how to use it 
 My confidence is dwindling 
 Look at the shape I'm in 
 Where's my pearls, where's my swine? 
 I'm not thirsty, but I'm standing in line. 
 I'll have the usual 
 I'll have the usual 
 Fifty silhouettes bumpin' on the dance floor 
 Pink elephants fallin' through a trap door 
 Sixty cigarettes a day 'cause I'm nervous 
 When will that bitch serve us? 
 I used to be a good boy, livin' the good life 
 Fifty thousand kisses later she was a housewife 
 She was good, I was unkind 
 I'm not thirsty, but I'm standin' in line 
 I'll have the usual 
 I'll have the usual 
 (On the rocks) 
 (Two ice cubes) 
 (And a little umbrella) 
 Big Jim says the second comin's comin' 
 I think he's just seein' double or something 
 Or something 
 You can hang around waiting for the also rans 
 I can't win, but I've seen enough, man 
 A fifth of whiskey he could knock it away 
 I drink some more and it's judgment day 
 I had a future, but she just passed out 
 I'm gonna drink until I see what it is I wanna think about 
 I'll have the usual 
 I'll have the usual 
 I'll have the usual 
 On the rocks 
 With a twist"
442,Bob Dylan,rock,Waiting For You,"I never dreamed it could be 
 A someone made just for me. 
 When I'm letting her have her way, 
 I'm here to see what she has to say. 
 Aw, the poor girl always wins the day. 
 I'm stayin' ahead of the game, 
 And she's a-doin' the same, 
 And the whiskey flyin' into my head. 
 The fiddler's arm has gone dead, 
 And talk is beginning to spread 
 When did our love go bad? 
 Whatever happened to the best friend that I had? 
 It's been so long since I held you tight 
 Been so long since we said goodnight. 
 The taste of tears is bittersweet. 
 When you're near me, my heart forgets to beat. 
 You're there every night 
 Among the good and the true, 
 And I'll be around, waitin' for you. 
 Well, the king of them all 
 Is starting to fall. 
 I lost my gal at the boatman's ball. 
 The night has a thousand hearts and eyes. 
 Hope may vanish, but it never dies. 
 I'll see you tomorrow when freedom rings. 
 I'm gonna stay on top of things. 
 It's the middle of summer, 
 And the moon is blue. 
 And I'll be around, waitin' for you. 
 Another deal gone down, 
 Another man done gone. 
 You put up with it all, and you carry on. 
 Something holding you back, 
 But you'll come through. 
 I'd bet the world and everything in it on you. 
 Happiness is but a state of mind. 
 Anytime you want, you can cross the state line. 
 You don't need to be rich 
 Or well-to-do, 
 I'll be around, waitin' for you."
443,Bob Dylan,rock,You Belong To Me,"See the pyramids along the Nile 
 Watch the sunrise from a tropic isle 
 Just remember, darling all the while 
 You belong to me 
 See the marketplace in old Algiers 
 Send me photographs and souvenirs 
 Just remember when a dream appears 
 You belong to me 
 I'll be so alone without you 
 Maybe you'll be lonesome too 
 And blue 
 Fly the ocean in a silver plane 
 See the jungle when it's wet with rain 
 Just remember till you're home again 
 You belong to me 
 I'll be so alone without you 
 Maybe you'll be lonesome too 
 And blue 
 Fly the ocean in a silver plane 
 See the jungle when it's wet with rain 
 Just remember 'til you're home again 
 You belong to me"
444,Bob Dylan,rock,'Cross The Green Mountain,"I cross the green mountain, I slept by the stream 
 Heaven blazin' in my head, I dreamt a monstrous dream 
 Somethin' came up out of the sea 
 Swept through the land of the rich and the free 
 I look into the eyes of my merciful friend 
 And then I ask myself, is this the end? 
 Memories linger, sad yet sweet 
 And I think of the souls in heaven who will meet 
 Altars are burnin' with flames far and wide 
 The foe has crossed over from the other side 
 They tip their caps from the top of the hill 
 You can feel them come, more brave blood to spill 
 Along the dim Atlantic line 
 The ravaged land lies for miles behind 
 The light's comin' forward and the streets are broad 
 All must yield to the avengin' God 
 The world is old, the world is gray 
 Lessons of life can't be learned in a day 
 I watch and I wait and I listen while I stand 
 To the music that comes from a far better land 
 Close the eyes of our captain, peace may he know 
 His long night is done, the great leader is laid low 
 He was ready to fall, he was quick to defend 
 Killed outright he was, by his own men 
 It's the last day's last hour of the last happy year 
 I feel that the unknown world is so near 
 Pride will vanish and glory will rot 
 But virtue lives and cannot be forgot 
 The bells of the evening have rung 
 There's blasphemy on every tongue 
 Let 'em say that I walked in fair nature's light 
 And that I was loyal to truth and to right 
 Serve God and be cheerful, look upward, beyond 
 Beyond the darkness of masks, the surprises of dawn 
 In the deep green grasses of the blood stained wood 
 They never dreamed of surrenderin', they fell where they stood 
 Stars fell over Alabama, I saw each star 
 You're walkin' in dreams, whoever you are 
 Chilled are the skies, keen is the frost 
 The grounds froze hard and the morning is lost 
 A letter to mother came today 
 Gun shot wound to the breast is what it did say 
 But he'll be better soon, he's in a hospital bed 
 But he'll never be better, he's already dead 
 I'm ten miles outside the city and I'm lifted away 
 In an ancient light that is not of day 
 They were calm, they were blunt, we knew 'em all too well 
 We loved each other more than we ever dared to tell"
445,Bob Dylan,rock,California,"I'm goin' down south 
 'Neath the borderline 
 I'm goin' down south 
 'Neath the borderline 
 Some fat momma 
 Kissed my mouth one time 
 Well, I needed it this morning 
 Without a shadow of doubt 
 My suitcase is packed 
 My clothes are hangin' out 
 San Francisco's fine 
 You sure get lots of sun 
 San Francisco is fine 
 You sure get lots of sun 
 But I'm used to four seasons 
 California's got but one 
 Well, I got my dark sunglasses 
 I got for good luck my black tooth 
 I got my dark sunglasses 
 And for good luck I got my black tooth 
 Don't ask me nothin' about nothin' 
 I just might tell you the truth"
446,Bob Dylan,rock,Mystery Train,"Train, train 
 Comin' round the bend 
 Train, train 
 Comin' round the bend 
 Well that long black train 
 Good Lord she's gone again 
 Train, train 
 Runnin' down the track 
 Train, train 
 Runnin' down the track 
 Well it's got my baby 
 And he ain't comin' back 
 Train, train 
 Runnin' down the line 
 Train, train 
 Runnin' down the line 
 Well he took my baby 
 Lord knows he's ?? 
 Train, train 
 Runnin' down the line 
 Train, train 
 Runnin' down the line 
 Well she took my baby 
 Good Lord she's mine all mine 
 Hey, hey 
 Hey hey hey"
