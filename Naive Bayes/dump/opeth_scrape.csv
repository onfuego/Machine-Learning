0,Opeth,metal,In The Mist She Was Standing,"Seven milestones... 
 Under a watching autumn eye 
 Contorted trees are spreading forth 
 The message of the wind 
 With frozen hands I rode with the stars 
 With anger the wind blew 
 Giving wings to my stallion 
 Clouds gathered across the moon 
 Blazing the white light 
 Passing the lake I know so well 
 I am near, yet so far away 
 Arrival... 
 I saw her shadow (standing) in the darkness 
 Awaiting me like the night 
 Awaits the day 
 Standing silent smiling at my presence 
 A black candle holds the only light 
 Darkness encloses 
 And the candle seem to expire 
 In her cold, cold hand 
 And as a forlorn soul 
 It will fade away 
 Touching her flesh in this night 
 My blood froze forever 
 Embraced before the dawn 
 A kiss brought total eclipse 
 And she spoke 
 Once and forever 
 I am so cold 
 In mist enrobed the twilight 
 She was standing..."
1,Opeth,metal,Under The Weeping Moon,"Once again I've cried 
 Unto the moon 
 That burning flame 
 That has guided me 
 Through all these years 
 The lake from which you flow 
 With eyes of fire 
 Once unlit but now alive 
 This energy, sparkling 
 Like a morning star 
 The morning star 
 Riding the fires of 
 The northern gold 
 I've searched the eye 
 I laugh under the weeping moon 
 I am the watcher in the skies 
 Nor the emeralds know my mark 
 Glisten to mark their presence 
 Set the enigma ablaze 
 Searching... 
 Finding... 
 Burn the winter landmarks 
 That said I was there 
 Burn the spirit of cold 
 That travel through my soul"
2,Opeth,metal,Forest Of October,"The memories that now rests in this forest 
 Forever shadowing the sunrise of my heart 
 Wings leave their nest at my coming 
 Swaying away unto the cold glowing sky 
 Dreaming away for a while 
 My spirit sighs in peace 
 Gazing unto the stars 
 Please, take me there 
 I am so alone, so cold 
 My heart is to scarred to glow 
 I wish the sunrise to come 
 Take my soul (away) 
 From this cold, lonely shell 
 I am free 
 From the eternal sea I rose 
 Veiled in darkness on either shore 
 Lost my pride, lost its glow 
 For me the sun rose no more 
 The forest of October 
 Sleeps silent when I depart 
 The web of time 
 Hides my last trace 
 My blaze travel the last universe 
 Like the sights of magic 
 Wrapped in aeons 
 My mind is one with my soul 
 I fall alone 
 While leaves fall from the weeping trees"
3,Opeth,metal,The Twilight Is My Robe,"Unto you I whisper 
 The wildest dreams 
 In the coldness of night 
 Shrouded in crystals 
 Through a frosty dusk 
 Souls of the fullmoon awaits 
 Their shadows ablaze 
 We are all bending 
 Our tired leaves over your empty shell 
 In the sign of true esteem 
 Are you beloved lord 
 Sighing deep under these waterfalls? 
 The birds of the sun 
 Seperates these dark clouds 
 While the winds of winter sleeps gently around 
 I am sworn to the oath 
 To breathe... 
 At the waters I dwell 
 The waves are still whispering 
 Ancient lullabies 
 I die... 
 While our mystic brothers still seek 
 Under your command I will obey 
 In my vision 
 You are the embodiment of pure freedom 
 But through my eyes you are made of stone"
4,Opeth,metal,The Apostle In Triumph,"In solitude I wander... 
 Through the vast enchanted forest 
 The surrounding skies are one 
 Torn apart by the phenomenon of lightning 
 Rain is pouring down my (now) shivering shoulders 
 In the rain my tears are forever lost 
 The darkened oaks are my only shelter 
 Red leaves are blown by the wind 
 An ebony raven now catches my eye 
 Sitting in calmness 
 Before spreading his black wings 
 Reaching for the skies 
 In this forest 
 Where wolves cry their agony unto the moon 
 My spirit is hidden 
 In the form of wisdom 
 Carved on a black stone 
 The only way to follow 
 Open your soul 
 Redeem, I am immortal 
 Blinded by a light 
 My soul is held up high in glory 
 I engulf the skies 
 The apostle in triumph 
 Through the eternal flame I travel 
 As the rain keeps falling..."
5,Opeth,metal,Advent,"It was all true 
 A parlour strode, and the night sets forever 
 I stray in the quiet cold 
 And you gird me when I dare to listen 
 Elastic meadow, endless arms of sorrow 
 Lips try to form ""because"" 
 Trying to adapt to the wilderness 
 Where even foes close their eyes and leave 
 We are inside the glade 
 Every now and then I wipe the dust aside 
 To remember... 
 How I drape my face with my bare hands 
 The same that brought me here 
 But you were beyond all help 
 The folded message that wept my name 
 Shadows skulk at my coming 
 We survey the slopes 
 In search for the words to write the missing page 
 The tainted dogma 
 Time grows short 
 As the piper plays his tune 
 We are almost there 
 You are beyond all help 
 Dancing into the void 
 We are almost there"
6,Opeth,metal,The Night And The Silent Water,"And so you left us 
 Jaded and gaunt, some September 
 Wilted with the seasons 
 But hidden inside the delusion 
 I saw your eyes, somewhere 
 Devoid of death 
 The aura poises amidst (the storm) 
 In solid tears I linger 
 A parlour glade, moonlit sorrow 
 Lonely resting pools 
 Relics of the moon-dogged lake 
 Whisper: ""All your words are misgiven"" 
 Am I like them? 
 Those who mourn and turn away 
 Those who would give anything 
 To see you again 
 If only for another second 
 Your face was, like the photograph 
 Painted white 
 We did not speak very often about it 
 What does it matter now? 
 Cloak of autumn shroud 
 I gaze, dim ricochet of stars 
 I reckon it is time for me to leave 
 You sleep in the light 
 Yet the night and the silent water 
 Still so dark"
7,Opeth,metal,Nectar,"I arose from the lullaby 
 Enduring yet another tale 
 You tempt me again 
 With your embrace, so tainted 
 Within the night you beckon 
 Cursing me with every glance 
 Bring me through 
 Carry my empty shadow 
 And guide me inside your warped labyrinth 
 To the well of sin 
 I swear I will always love you 
 Leave me speechless 
 Release my yearning 
 The soil I walk is clad with light 
 Drifting moons thrust me with their rays 
 And I fall inside 
 I lament this heritage 
 Cannot bid farewell 
 The pale face... you went as far as you could 
 And from that moment 
 I witnessed your beauty, fealt your death 
 Mine is yours, mine is yours 
 In the wake of dawn 
 The mist of morning linger before it leaves 
 Invisible eyes, red reflection 
 It is you 
 Smiling in the midst of the moor"
8,Opeth,metal,Black Rose Immortal,"In the name of desperation 
 I call your name 
 A lamentation I sigh 
 Again and again 
 Spiritual eclipse 
 The gateways are closed for me to seek 
 The night... 
 A veil of stars, watching 
 My shadow is born from light 
 The light of the eye, in darkness 
 Over troubled waters memories soar 
 Endlessly, searching night and day 
 The moonlight caresses a lonely hill 
 With the calmness of a whisper 
 I wear a naked soul 
 A blank face in the streaming water 
 It is cold in here 
 Frost scar my coat with dust 
 Eyes attach to your mute portrait 
 We spoke only through thoughts 
 Together we gazed, awaited 
 Hours brought thirst and the rising sun 
 Sunbirds leave their dark recesses 
 Shadows glid the archways 
 Do not turn your face towards me 
 Confronting me with my lonliness 
 You are in a forest unknown 
 The secret orchard 
 And your voice is vast and achromatic 
 But still so precious 
 Lullaby of the crescent moon took you 
 Mesmerized, its kaleidoscopic face 
 Granted you a hollow stare 
 Another soul within the divine herd 
 I have kept it 
 The amaranth symbol 
 Hidden inside the golden shrine 
 Until we rejoice in the meadow 
 Of the end 
 When we both walk the shadows 
 It will set ablaze and vanish 
 Black rose immortal 
 It is getting dark again 
 Dusk shuffle across the fields 
 The evening trees moan as if they knew 
 At night I always dream of you"
9,Opeth,metal,To Bid You Farewell,"I am awaiting 
 The sunrise 
 Gazing modestly through the coldest morning 
 Once it came you lied 
 Embracing us over 
 Autumn's proud treetops 
 I stand motionless 
 In a parade of falling rain 
 Your voice I cannot hear 
 As I am falling again 
 Devotion eludes 
 And in sadness I lumber 
 In my own ashes 
 I am standing without a soul 
 She wept and whispered: 
 ""I know..."" 
 We walked into the night 
 Am I 
 To bid you farewell? 
 Why can't you see 
 That I try? 
 When every tear I shed 
 Is for you?"
10,Opeth,metal,Prologue,"A morning in magenta, the petals fed from the dew 
 She held her breath for a moment, to pause off the stream 
 Still clinging to vast, old memories 
 And I would marvel at her beauty, playing through the rain 
 The coffin is beautifully engraved 
 Stained by soil, symbols of death 
 All of which are stared upon, with porcelain eyes it seems 
 Some spoke, and it was my turn to go 
 In death entwined, I could not believe 
 But it hangs around my neck 
 A soft breeze passed me by, somewhat warmer for a second 
 I knew it was the coming of spring, and thus our APRIL ETHEREAL"
11,Opeth,metal,April Ethereal,"It was me, peering through the looking-glass 
 Beyond the embrace of Christ 
 Like the secret face within the tapestry 
 Like a bird of prey over the crest 
 And she was swathed in sorrow 
 As if born within its mask 
 Her candlelight snuffed, the icon smiled 
 Emptiness followed in her wake 
 I could clasp her in undying love 
 Within ghostlike rapture the final word was mine 
 She faced me in awe 
 It was a token of ebony colour 
 Embodied in faint vapour 
 Wandering through April's fire 
 Compelled to grasp and to hold the one that was you 
 I will endure, hide away 
 I would outrun the scythe, glaring with failure 
 It is a mere destiny I thought 
 A threshold I had crossed before 
 The rain was waving goodbye 
 And when the night came the forest folded its branches around me 
 Something passed by, and I went into a dream 
 She, laughing and weeping at once: ""Take me away"" 
 I don't know how or why, and I'll never know WHEN"
12,Opeth,metal,When,"Red sun rising somewhere through the dense fog 
 The portrait of the jaded dawn who had seen it all before 
 This day wept on my shoulders 
 Still the same as yesterday 
 This path seems endless, body is numb 
 The soul has lost its flame 
 Walking in familiar traces to find my way back home 
 So there I was 
 Within the sobriety of the immortals 
 A semblance of supernatural winds passing through 
 The garden sighs, flowers die 
 The gate was closed that day, but I was bound to carry on 
 She could not see me through the windows 
 In dismay, strangest twist upon her lips 
 Graven face, she said my name 
 Once inside I heard whispers in the parlour 
 The gilded faces grin, aware of my final demise 
 And I cried, I knew she had lied 
 Her obsession had died, it had died 
 When can I take you from this place? 
 When is the word but a sigh? 
 When is death our lone beholder? 
 When do we walk the final steps? 
 When can we scream instead of whisper? 
 When is the new beginning, and the end of this sad MADRIGAL?"
13,Opeth,metal,Madrigal,"Our abode 'mongst the stars is waiting, 
 Long enough for our last breath of life 
 You stare at nothing, right through me 
 At times resembling the Devil's concubine 
 And me, I am the idol that would long 
 To caress your eyes until they would open no more 
 I would comfort you if I only could 
 But as we all know by now... I am just thin air 
 Unaware as you are of my presence, 
 You are losing yourself 
 Hiding within THE AMEN CORNER"
14,Opeth,metal,The Amen Corner,"White summer 
 So far I have gone to see you again 
 Hiding your face in the palm of your hands 
 Finding solace in the words I do despise 
 You snatch at every sound 
 And even though you believe that I am shackled within death, 
 Memories are tainted with paleness 
 Crestfallen still 
 Those eyes... empty like a barren well 
 It was the only task I would undertake 
 To reap the harvest that was mine 
 The seed that had sprung into a florid meadow 
 And left me helpless in your embrace 
 The bond we never spoke of, once stark and enticing 
 Now slowly smoldering to dust 
 The celestial touch, from grey to black 
 A fathomless void enclosing 
 Unwritten secrets beneath the cobwebs 
 I can not endure 
 And so I rose from my sleep 
 The moon turned away its face 
 Overture of the long, black night begins... 
 Something you said: ""Eerie circles upon the waters"" 
 Until now we have shared the same aura 
 My ashes within your hands 
 My breath in the sepulchral mound 
 You know that your night is my day 
 The final spark that blew life into me, the DEMON OF THE FALL"
15,Opeth,metal,Demon Of The Fall,"Silent dance with death 
 Everything is lost 
 Torn by the arrival of Autumn 
 The blink of an eye, you know it's me 
 You keep the dagger close at hand 
 And you saw nothing 
 False love turned to pure hate 
 The wind cried a lamentation 
 Before merging with the grey 
 Demon, demon of the fall 
 Demon, demon of the fall 
 Demon, demon of the fall 
 Demon, demon of the fall 
 Gasping for another breath 
 She rose, screaming at closed doors 
 Seductive faint mist 
 Forging through the cracks in the wall 
 I shant resist 
 In tears for all of eternity 
 She turned around and faced me for the first time 
 Run away, run away, run away 
 Run away, run away, run away 
 Just one second 
 And I was left with nothing 
 Her fragrance still pulsating through damp air 
 That day came to an end 
 And she had lost in me, her CREDENCE"
16,Opeth,metal,Credence,"Deserted again 
 You speak to me through the shadows 
 Walking in closed rooms, using cold words 
 Captured by the night 
 The yearning escapes from my embrace 
 Strange silhouettes whisper your thoughts, scream your sadness 
 And they all turned away, unable to face more of this death 
 Credence in my word 
 Written in dust, tainted by memories 
 I confess my hope, recognize my loneliness 
 Your laughter weeps the truth 
 Push me into the corners 
 Confirming the epitaph of my soul 
 And displaying the once unknown KARMA"
17,Opeth,metal,Karma,"And as they say, grief is only able to possess 
 The rotting body, clad in ancient clothes 
 Is left behind with a wave of the hand 
 I have gone away, the bed is cold and empty 
 Trees bend their boughs towards the earth 
 And night-time birds float as black faces 
 It was the hand, reaching out through the mirror 
 Unknown and scarred by life... 
 The luring eyes, you had never seen 
 You have nothing more to find 
 You have nothing more to lose 
 You have nothing more to find 
 You have nothing more to lose 
 The cold season drifts over the land 
 They all huddle in the brown corners 
 Some would settle for less 
 The castles were all empty, asleep 
 Long awaiting their king 
 Beckoning round the bend 
 Amidst the forest one would hear that I had been there 
 Draped within a fate I could not change 
 And always welcoming Winter's EPILOGUE"
18,Opeth,metal,Epilogue,"There it was 
 The final destiny 
 A sunrise that never came 
 Still the night lamp that never faded away 
 Farewell was the word 
 And the afterglow was the brave morning 
 Rising and telling everyone 
 About the beauty of its PROLOGUE"
19,Opeth,metal,Circle Of The Tyrants,"After the battle is over 
 And the sands drank the blood 
 All what there remains 
 Is the bitterness of delusion 
 (The circle of the tyrants) 
 The immortality of the gods 
 Sits at their side 
 As they leave the walls behind 
 To reach the jewels gleam 
 (The circle of the tyrants) 
 The days have come 
 When steel will rule 
 And upon his head 
 A crown of gold 
 Your hand wields the might 
 The tyrant's the precursor 
 You carry the will 
 As the morning is near 
 I sing the ballads 
 Of victory and defeat 
 I hear the tales 
 Of frozen misery 
 Your hand wields the might 
 The tyrant's the precursor 
 You carry the will 
 As the morning is near 
 The new kingdoms rise 
 By the circle of the tyrants 
 In the land of darkness 
 The warrior, that was me 
 Grotesque glory 
 None will ever see them fall 
 And hunts and wars 
 Are like everlasting shadows 
 Where the winds cannot reach 
 The tyrant's might was born 
 And often I look back 
 With tears in my eyes 
 Grotesque glory 
 None will ever see them fall 
 And hunts and wars 
 Are like everlasting shadows"
20,Opeth,metal,Remember Tomorrow,"Unchain the colours before my eyes 
 Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies 
 Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher 
 I shall return from out of the fire 
 Tears for remembrance, and tears for joy 
 Tears for somebody but this lonely boy 
 Out in the madness, the all seeing eye 
 Flickers above us, to light up the sky 
 Unchain the colours before my eyes 
 Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies 
 Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher 
 I shall return from out of the..."
21,Opeth,metal,The Moor,"The sigh of summer upon my return 
 Fifteen alike since I was here 
 Bathed in deep fog, blurring my trail 
 Snuffing the first morning rays 
 Weary from what might have been ages 
 Still calm with my mind at peace 
 Would I prosper or fall, Drain the past 
 The lapse of the moment took its turn 
 I was foul and tainted, Devoid of faith 
 Wearing my death-mask at birth 
 The hands of God, Decrepit and thin 
 Cold caress and then nothing 
 I was taken away from my plight 
 A treason bestowed to the crowd 
 Branded a jonah with fevered blood 
 Ungodly freak, Defiler 
 Pale touch, Writhing in the embers 
 Damp mud burning in my eyes 
 All the faces turned away 
 And all would sneer at my demise 
 Outcast with dogmas forged below 
 Seared and beaten, Banished from where I was born 
 No mercy would help me on my way 
 In the pouring rain nothing is the same 
 Vows in ashes 
 I pledge myself to no-one 
 Seethed and spiteful 
 All shudder at the call of my name 
 If you'll bear with me 
 You'll fear of me 
 There is no forgiveness in these eyes 
 For any of you but one 
 Dispel the mist for now 
 Melinda is the reason why I've come 
 She is waterdrops over the pyre 
 A thistle in my hands 
 Stained and torn, Aged and brown 
 Virtuous shell with kindred innocence 
 I awoke from the miasma 
 Passing swiftly through the moor 
 This is here, Waters stir 
 And in the distance all that was lost 
 If you'll bear with me 
 You'll fear of me 
 You'd never leave me to 
 A fate with you"
22,Opeth,metal,Godhead's Lament,"Marauder 
 Staining the soil, midst of stillness 
 Beloved fraternity to an end 
 Red eyes probe the scene 
 All the same 
 Stilted for the beholder 
 Depravity from the core 
 Hand carved death in stone laden aisles 
 I hide the scars from my past 
 Yet they sense my (mute) dirge 
 This is when it all falls apart 
 White hands grasping for straws 
 Sly smile, poisoned glare behind 
 Undisguised manmade nova 
 Mute cry, don't dare to tread 
 Searing beams tracking you down 
 Adoring what never has been 
 Some will bring with them all they have seen 
 Searching my way to perplexion 
 The gleam of her eyes 
 In that moment she knew 
 Thought I could not leave this place 
 On this imminent day 
 As I've reached the final dawn 
 To what's gone astray 
 What would they care if I did stay 
 No one would know 
 What would they care if I did stay 
 No one should know 
 Thought I could not leave this place 
 On this imminent day 
 As I've reached the final dawn 
 To what's gone astray 
 What would they care if I did stay 
 No one would know 
 What would they care if I did stay

 Blank godhead, tear my name 
 Lost virtue, frantic lust

 Undisguised manmade nova 
 Mute cry, don't dare to tread 
 Searing beams tracking you down 
 Adoring what never has been 
 Some will bring with them all they have seen

 Bearing her pain in the wilderness 
 The gleam of her eyes 
 In that moment she knew"

 Here we'll be gone 
 So far away 
 From our weak and crumbling lives 
 Come into this night 
 When days are done 
 Lost and astray 
 In what's vanished from your eyes 
 What came and distorted your sight 
 Saw you benighted by your fright 
 Come into this night 
 Your plight alone 
 Carry your weight 
 You are flawed as all of us 
 Come into this night 
 Your only home 
 It's never too late 
 To repent, suffer the loss 
 What came and distorted your sight 
 Saw you benighted by your fright 
 What came and distorted your sight 
 Saw you benighted by your fright 
 Come into this night 
 When you're able 
 To undo your deeds 
 And atone with your lonely soul 
 Once you're into this night 
 All minds are stable 
 Forget all your needs 
 Lose the grip of all control"
24,Opeth,metal,Moonlapse Vertigo,"Kept warm by the light of the lantern 
 Lost sight of everything tonight my presence 
 Blacken their patterns 
 A pock in the healthy and calm 
 Their scorn behind your back 
 My promise would put them down 
 No trace of reverence left 
 Immemorial fire in their eyes 
 I would perish at the given signal 
 At the slightest touch from my soul 
 Tainted prophet in flesh 
 For all the plagued and lost 
 Dripping sin, desicion in stalemate 
 Dare to feel death at hand 
 Surprised me with its voice 
 Through the forest came the morn 
 Across the leafy pathway 
 Their deeds smeared in blood 
 For all to behold 
 The council of the cross 
 Must have sensed my coming 
 The pest through the air 
 With despise for squalor 
 Lashing out at the poor 
 I turned away my eyes 
 In pallor escape from the end 
 Fading time to leave from here 
 And less to fulfill my task 
 She would be safe and firm 
 Nothing of this is in vain 
 Taken away from stifling grace 
 And saved from the past"
25,Opeth,metal,Face Of Melinda,"By the turnstile beckons a damsel fair 
 The face of Melinda neath blackened hair 
 No joy would flicker in her eyes 
 Brooding sadness came to arise 
 Words would falter to atone 
 Failure had passed the stepping stone 
 She had sworn her vows to another 
 This is when no-one will bother 
 And conceded pain in crumbling mirth 
 A harlot of God upon the earth 
 Found where she sacrificed her ways 
 That hollow love in her face 
 Still I plotted to have her back 
 Contentment that would fill the crack 
 My soul released a fluttering sigh 
 This day fell, The darkness nigh 
 I took her by the hand to say 
 All faith forever has been washed away 
 I returned for you in great dismay 
 Come with me, Far away to stay 
 Endlessly gazing in nocturnal prime 
 She spoke of her vices and broke the rhyme 
 But baffled herself with the final line 
 My promise is made but my heart is thine"
26,Opeth,metal,Serenity Painted Death,"Returned from a hibernal dream 
 Voices fell like marble 
 No longer by my side 
 Gone all that would linger 
 Ripped from my embrace 
 Melinda reflected in shafts 
 Red line round her neck 
 Met the earth in silence 
 White faced, Haggard grin 
 This serenity painted death 
 With a halo of bitter disease 
 Black paragon in lingering breath 
 White faced, Haggard grin 
 This serenity painted death 
 With a halo of bitter disease 
 Black paragon in lingering breath 
 Saw here fading, blank stare into me 
 Clenched fist from the beautiful pain 
 Darkness reared its head 
 Tearing within the reeling haze 
 Took control, Claiming my flesh 
 Piercing rage, Perfect tantrum 
 Each and every one would die at my hand 
 Choking in warm ponds of blood 
 At last, weak and torn, I went down 
 Drained from strength, Flickering breath 
 Came with the moon 
 The wayward in conscious state 
 Flanked and barred in destiny's end 
 Underneath with hope in laches 
 Swathed in filth, Any would betoken 
 Starlit shadows on the wall 
 Finally there to collect me 
 From the bowels of sin 
 White faced, Haggard grin 
 This serenity painted death 
 With a halo of bitter disease 
 Black paragon in lingering breath

27,Opeth,metal,White Cluster,"Still it came passing by 
 The pieces weaved together rose the sun 
 And fooled me with another day 
 The knocking message called for my life 
 Sealed the spell of my scrawny body 
 Soil to skin, My next of kin 
 Damp air grasped, Stole the words 
 And greeted me with a hiss 
 This is forgiveness, So I know 
 Once I repent I seal the lid 
 I slither for you and I'm dying 
 I find trust in hate 
 They wear white for me 
 Seemingly jaded and lost 
 I forge myself into your dreams 
 And here I am your life 
 Hangman, Clutching at his tools 
 I will come for you 
 The noose is tied 
 Murmur through the crowd 
 Plunging into anywhere but here 
 Cloak-captured sighs of relief 
 As the primal touch brought me back 
 And the last sight I did see is still here 
 Beckoning right behind me"

 Naked, freezing from my breath 
 Neath the lid all limbs tucked away

 Your body is mine to avail 
 Such a tragic sight you are 
 Slave under my creed 
 Spurring me with those tears 
 I am beyond death 
 Midst a dreaming affinity 
 Saving strength now, faint whispers 
 Come erotic communion in its splendour 
 Fever mirrored ghosts 
 Night time consolation, cross the line 
 Draw murder into art 
 Sleep inside through days 
 In the wake of this relief 
 Shivering, longing for more 
 Insanity at its peak 
 Love me to my death 
 Lost are days of Spring 
 You sighted and let me in 
 Keep the beast inside 
 Shackled within my hide 
 Screaming out too late 
 Losing to my hate 
 Grew together with your skin 
 And paced the trails of sin 
 Your gaze covered in virgin snow 
 Rigid features 
 It's the shallow deeds who is to blame 
 Deafening shrieks pierced the night 
 A step from oblivion 
 Moving into the dim lights 
 Hiding within a reverie 
 It was worth it for the wait alone 
 Your body is mine to avail 
 Such a tragic sight you are 
 Slave under my creed 
 Spurring me with those tears"

 Shroud me into 
 Nightmares of the sun

 I am moving closer to your side 
 Luring 
 You are luring me into the night

 Bereavement 
 Faster yet

 Is set 
 Devious movements in your eyes

 Breath comes out white clouds with your lies

 Slight twist, shivering corpse 
 Ornated with water, fills the cracks 
 Clasped in my limbs by tradition 
 This is all you need"
30,Opeth,metal,Harvest,"Stay with me a while 
 Rise above the vile 
 Name my final rest 
 Poured into my chest 
 Into the orchard I walk peering way past the gate 
 Wilted scenes for us who couldn't wait 
 Drained by the coldest caress, stalking shadows ahead 
 Halo of death, all I see is departure 
 Mourners lament, but it's me who's the martyr 
 Pledge yourself to me 
 Never leave me be 
 Sweat breaks on my brow 
 Given time ends now 
 Into the orchard I walk peering way past the gate 
 Wilted scenes for us who couldn't wait 
 Drained by the coldest caress, stalking shadows ahead 
 Halo of death, all I see is departure 
 Mourners lament, but it's me who's the martyr 
 Spirit painted sin 
 Embers neath my skin 
 Veiled in pale embrace 
 Reached and touched my face 
 Into the orchard I walk peering way past the gate 
 Wilted scenes for us who couldn't wait 
 Drained by the coldest caress, stalking shadows ahead 
 (Release your grip, let me go into this sight) 
 Halo of death, all I see is departure 
 Mourners lament, but it's me who's the martyr"
31,Opeth,metal,The Drapery Falls,"Please remedy my confusion 
 And thrust me back to the day 
 The silence of your seclusion 
 Brings night into all you say 
 Pull me down again and guide me into pain 
 I'm counting nocturnal hours 
 Drowned visions in haunted sleep 
 Faint flickering of your powers 
 Leaks out to show what you keep 
 Pull me down again and guide me into... 
 There is failure inside 
 This test I can't persist 
 Kept back by the enigma 
 No criteria demanded here 
 Deadly patterns made my wreath 
 Prosperous in your ways 
 Pale ghost in the corner 
 Pouring a caress on your shoulder 
 Ooh, puzzled by shrewd innocence 
 Runs a thick tide beneath 
 Ushered into inner graves 
 Nails bleeding from the struggle 
 It's the end for the weak at heart 
 Always the same 
 A lullaby for the ones who've lost all 
 Reeling inside 
 Gleaming eye in your necklace reflects 
 Stare of primal regrets 
 You turn your back and you walk away 
 Never again 
 Spiraling to the ground below 
 Like autumn leaves left in the wake to fade 
 Waking up to your sound again 
 And lapse into the ways of misery"
32,Opeth,metal,Dirge For November,"Lost, here is nowhere 
 Searching home still 
 Turning past me, all are gone 
 Time is now 
 The omen showed, took me away 
 Preparations are done, this can't last 
 The mere reflection brought disgust 
 No ordeal to conquer, this firm slit 
 It sheds upon the floor, dripping into a pool 
 Grant me sleep, take me under 
 Like the wings of a dove, folding around 
 I fade into this tender care"
33,Opeth,metal,The Funeral Portrait,"You wait by the window 
 Morning's breath on the sill 
 Idle hands given another try 
 So you wait and you savour the moment 
 Outside the canvas turned white 
 Ruby eyes in the fog 
 Rain washing clean all the sins 
 A liquid gown that covers all 
 Your loathe turns endless 
 Opened mirage soothes your sense 
 Locked on the pinnacle 
 The best secret within 
 Like a derelict child 
 Heart burning for a stranger 
 Ascending to the meek 
 Flock round the liars in awe 
 Caked in the soil beneath 
 Fear me when we meet 
 Turn away in admiration 
 My firm grip round the nucleus of joy 
 Enough of this 
 You will leave me now 
 You will see it now 
 Perish at my hands 
 Close to you 
 Tangled up in hair 
 Fresh stigma look 
 Shall I take you with me 
 And it is cold 
 Ruby eyes in the fog 
 It is me 
 And you are just like them all 
 Stained by the names of fathers 
 I'm greeting my downward fall 
 Leaving the throes to others

34,Opeth,metal,Blackwater Park,"Confessor of the tragedies in man 
 Lurking in the core of us all 
 The last dying call for the everlost 
 Brief encounters, bleeding pain 
 Lepers coiled neath the trees 
 Dying men in bewildered soliloquies 
 Perversions bloom round the bend 
 Seekers, lost in their quest 
 Ghosts of friends frolic 
 Under the waning moon 
 It is the year of death 
 Wielding his instruments 
 Stealth sovereign reaper 
 Touching us with ease 
 Infecting the roots in an instant 
 Burning crop of disease 
 I am just a spectator 
 An advocate documenting the loss 
 Fluttering with conceit 
 This doesn't concern me yet 
 Still far from the knell 
 Taunting their bereavement 
 Mob round the dead 
 Point fingers at the details 
 Probing vomits for more 
 Caught in unbridled suspense 
 We have all lost it now 
 Catching the flakes of dismay 
 Born the travesty of man 
 Regular pulse midst pandemonium 
 You're plucked to the mass 
 Parched with thirst for the wicked 
 Sick liaisons raised this monumental mark 
 The sun sets forever over Blackwater park"
35,Opeth,metal,Still Day Beneath The Sun,"There's a light that hits the gloom around 
 Shows the footprints round this grave 
 Dried up roses scattered on the mound 
 Honouring the one engraved 
 Will ever the morning 
 Carry away 
 The souls of those for whom we cry 
 Leaving 
 Grieving 
 Seeking 
 Meeting 
 Binding 
 Unwinding 
 Sighing 
 ""You"" 
 Still day 
 Beneath the sun 
 Asking you who 
 Is the one 
 And when 
 The day is late 
 We know who must forever wait 
 Black procession through the narrow aisles 
 Another's gone for all to see 
 Near the site for one who lost his trials 
 Sleeping neath the ground is me 
 Will ever the morning 
 Carry away 
 The souls of those for whom we cry 
 Leaving 
 Grieving 
 Seeking 
 Meeting 
 Binding 
 Unwinding 
 Sighing

36,Opeth,metal,Patterns In The Ivy II,"Without you I cannot confide in anything 
 The hope is pale designed in light of dreams you bring 
 Summer's gone, the day is done soon comes the night 
 Biding time, leaving the line and out of sight 
 One moonlit shadow on the wall 
 Disrupted in its own creation 
 Veiled in the darkness of this fall 
 Is this the end - manifestation 
 It runs in me, your poison seething in my veins 
 This skin is old and stained by late September rains 
 A final word from me would be the first for you 
 The rest is long but I'll go on inside and through 
 One moonlit shadow on the wall 
 Disrupted in its own creation 
 Veiled in the darkness of this fall 
 Is this the end - manifestation 
 Patterns in the ivy

37,Opeth,metal,Wreath,"Falling inside again 
 This nightmare always the same 
 Still never enough 
 Halting at the brink of discovery 
 Moving into the darkness 
 Leaking inside to cover up 
 Dragging me down and under 
 Entangled and undone at once 
 Old memories 
 I'm not in need but wish to know 
 What are the tragedies 
 The history behind the walls 
 Pacing further down 
 Familiar children's laughter 
 Dissonant and out of time 
 And their eyes are dead 
 Watching myself in a pool of water 
 Wearing the mask of a ghost 
 Smeared all across my skin 
 Rotten earth and insects 
 Endless night 
 Always preserving the calm 
 Movement behind 
 Bleeding animals in a field of fire 
 There is no absolution 
 Death is but a fairytale 
 They are mere visions 
 They are afraid of me 
 Clear insight 
 A smoke is rising nearby 
 Dust covering my coat 
 Blend together to spell my name 
 Pale, covered me with sweat 
 There are no words left 
 Sole provider of death 
 Distorted faith in myself 
 Human harvest burning 
 Blackest pages turning 
 Twisted perception come true 
 Captured in dreams connected 
 Staring right back 
 Spiritual decay, still seeking 
 Frozen in time 
 Mourn this departure, all watching 
 Calling me back 
 Closure to bleak matters, I'm leaving 
 End of a search 
 Coming of morning 
 Calling me back 
 Closure to bleak matters, I'm leaving 
 End of a search 
 Coming of morning, returning"
38,Opeth,metal,Deliverance,"Floating on mist 
 Crept up the caverns of my brain 
 Receiving no warning 
 From nothing to a life code 
 Walk with me, you'll never leave 
 Wait to see your spirit free 
 Tell me how your heart's in need 
 As I drown you in the sea 
 Unwinding snares of distrust 
 Your wrist in my face grip 
 Look me in the eye, I'm clear 
 This is your time 
 Face down beneath the waterline 
 Gazing into the deep 
 From love to death 
 In a time span of seconds 
 Oblivious to regret 
 Pushed into belief 
 In liquid cellophane 
 Gasping for air 
 Mercy in my eyes 
 Is the shade of the night 
 The piercing sounds you make 
 Soaring higher, higher now 
 And once left in my wake 
 Your memory is nothing but the scars on me 
 All over now 
 Forgotten why I needed this 
 Standing down 
 Disappear into the obscure 
 Resting days 
 Waiting for new disease 
 Biding time 
 Looked inside insanity 
 It always burns within 
 The downward spiral never ends 
 When driven into sin 
 Your salvation's found in a sinner's deed 
 All over now 
 Forgotten why I needed this 
 Standing down 
 Disappear into the obscure 
 Resting days 
 Waiting for new disease 
 Biding time 
 Looked inside insanity 
 The devil guides the day 
 Tells me what to say 
 Pours himself inside 
 And snuffs the final light 
 Deliverance thrown back at me 
 Deliverance laughing at me 
 Deliverance thrown back at me 
 Deliverance laughing at me"
39,Opeth,metal,A Fair Judgement,"Losing sleep in too deep 
 Fading sun, what have I done? 
 Came so close to what I need most 
 Nothing left here 
 Cut the ties, uncover disguise 
 Left behind all intertwined 
 Lost control, moved out of the role now 
 Nothing's left here 
 Leave it be, it was meant for me 
 Soul sacrifice, forgot the advice 
 Lost track of time in a flurry of smoke 
 Waiting anxiety for a fair judgement deserved 
 Losing sleep in too deep 
 Fading sun, what have I done? 
 Came so close to what I need most 
 Nothing left here"

 There is a light coming down on me 
 There is a doubt that is clearing 
 There is a day that is dawning 
 There is a wound that is healing 
 There is a season waiting for me 
 There is a road that is turning 
 There is a fire still burning 
 A sickness in me 
 Constant pace towards the end 
 The need is stronger 
 This time the need is deeper 
 There is a peace I am searching 
 There is a freedom I'm depending on 
 There is a pain that's never ending 
 There is a rain falling only on me 
 There is a dream I am living 
 There is a life I'm dreaming of 
 There is a death I'm awaiting 
 There is a home I am deserting 
 I hold my breath in wait 
 Only moments remain 
 Movement for departed hope 
 Effect for absent friends 
 Sever the faith from my body 
 Leave me begging for more 
 Take what I have and deliver me 
 Into everlasting sleep 
 Soothing trance 
 Colours fade 
 And disappear 
 Ethereal light 
 Showing me what I can do without 
 In a motionless scene 
 There is only me 
 I take what I can 
 Controlling you to get ahead 
 Fading away 
 And leaving 
 Long for sleep 
 Closer now 
 Lead the way into death 
 Every wretched dream 
 I've left behind 
 Every waking hour 
 I lie in wait 
 Sucked inside by will 
 Gone into the flood 
 All my questions unfurled 
 As I was put to the test 
 Once I'm below there's no turning back 
 Plunging into the deepest void 
 Departed shell left drained behind 
 Pacing roads unknown 
 Searching for a new home 
 Desert in my eye 
 Barren lands inside"

 I'm still beneath in the soil 
 Discard your clothes 
 Let loose you hair 
 We're intertwined forever and have always been 
 Say the word 
 And I'll depart 
 Upon your lips dwells nothing but the meaning of my cause 
 Rise to submission 
 I'm still beneath in the soil 
 And so comes the dark 
 Vibrant as ever before 
 Flowers already withered 
 In this endless winter of souls 
 Outside in the park 
 The days move along 
 And nothing ever changes 
 They have nothing on us 
 And we've always knew 
 That nothing ever changes 
 Rise to submission 
 I'm still beneath in the soil 
 This is ours alone 
 Feeding off the warmth 
 Lured out from inside 
 Depending on the life blood 
 Rise to submission 
 I'm still beneath in the soil 
 This is ours alone 
 Feeding off the warmth 
 Lured out from inside 
 Silently 
 Whispering 
 Move in me and set me free

 Counting hours, searching the night 
 Might be waiting for someone 
 Might be there for us to see 
 Might be in need of talking 
 Might be staring directly at me 
 Inside plays a lullaby 
 Slurred voice over children cries 
 On 
 The inside 
 Haunting loneliness in the eye 
 Skin covering a secret scar 
 His hand is waving a goodbye 
 There's no response or action returned 
 There is deep prejudice in me 
 Outshines all reason inside 
 Given dreams all riddled with pain 
 And projected unto the last"

 And no one would ask me to stay 
 And I 
 Should contemplate this change 
 To ease the pain 
 And I 
 Should step out of the rain 
 Turn away 
 Close to ending it all I am drifting through the stages of the rapture born within 
 This loss, thoughts of death inside tear me apart from the core of my soul 
 Summer is miles and miles away 
 And no one would ask me to stay 
 And I 
 Should contemplate this change 
 To ease the pain 
 And I 
 Should step out of the rain 
 Turn away 
 At times the 
 Dark's fading slowly 
 But it never 
 Sustains 
 Would someone 
 Watch over me 
 In my time of 
 Need 
 Summer is miles and miles away 
 And no one would ask me to stay

 Should contemplate this change 
 To ease the pain 
 And I

 Should step out of the rain

 And everything would change 
 Would conviction fall 
 In the shadow of the righteous?

 Pest-ridden jackals of the earth 
 Diabolical beasts and roaming the forests 
 In wait and constant protectors 
 Calling you to sit by his side 
 Your self-loathing image in his flesh 
 A revelation upon which you linger 
 His words are flies 
 Swarming towards the true insects 
 Feasting on buried dreams 
 And spreading decay upon your skin 
 His eyes spew forth a darkness 
 That cut through and paralyze 
 Casts light upon your secrets 
 Forced to confront your enemies 
 His mouth is a vortex 
 Sucking you into its pandemonium 
 Fools you with a helping hand of ashes 
 Reached out in false dismay 
 His body is a country 
 The cities lay dead beyond despair 
 Friends turned enemies unable to come clean 
 In a rising fog of reeking death 
 Everything you believed is a lie 
 Everyone you loved is a death-burden 
 So you take comfort in him 
 And you are receptive to stark wishes 
 No longer struggling to declare your stand 
 You would inflict no harm to others

 You are everything, they are nothing 
 Drown in the deep mire 
 With past desires 
 Beneath the mire 
 Drown desire now with you 
 Lined up verses on dead skin 
 The tainted lips of a stranger 
 Resting upon hers 
 And I embrace bereavement 
 Everything beloved is shattered anyway 
 I would devote myself to anyone 
 I would accept any flaws 
 I am too weak to resist 
 Tension vibrating with horror 
 Finding the outcast in my eyes 
 Pushing nerves on a puppet 
 Endless poison in my veins

 Whereas I thought of myself as a leader 
 You'd cling to your pleasant hope 
 It is twisted fascination 
 While I'd ruin the obstacles into despair 
 And I'm praising death 
 Lost love of the heart 
 In a holocaust scene memory 
 Decrepit body wearing transparent skin 
 Inside, the smoke of failure 
 Wept for solace and submit to faith 
 In his shadow I'm choking

 Nocturnally helpless 
 And weak in the light 
 Depending on a prayer 
 Pacing deserted roads to find 
 A seed of hope 
 They are the trees 
 Rotten pulp inside and never well 
 Roots are sucking, thieving from my source 
 Tired boughs reaching for the light 
 It is all false pretension 
 Harlequin forest 
 Awaiting redemption for a lifetime 
 As they die alone 
 With no one by their side 
 Are they forgiven?

 Poisoning the soul 
 Unfettered beast inside 
 Claiming sovereign control

 Tearing life crops asunder

 And isolation 
 Is all that would remain 
 ""The wound in me 
 Is pouring out to rest 
 On a lover's shore"""
57,Opeth,metal,Soldier Of Fortune,"I have often told you stories about the way 
 I lived the life of a drifter 
 Waiting for the day 
 When I'd take your hand and sing you songs then maybe you would say 
 Come lay with me, love me 
 I would surely stay 
 Now I feel I'm growing older 
 And all the songs that I have sung 
 Echo in the distance 
 Like the sound 
 Of a windmill going round 
 I guess I will always be 
 The soldier of fortune 
 Many times I've been a traveler, I looked for something new 
 In days of old when the nights were cold 
 I wandered without you 
 Those days I thought my eyes could see you standing near 
 Though blindness is confusing 
 It shows that you're not here 
 Now I feel I'm growing older 
 And all the songs that I have sung 
 Echo in the distance 
 Like the sound 
 Of a windmill going round 
 I guess I will always be 
 The soldier of fortune 
 I can hear the sound 
 Of a windmill going round 
 I guess I will always be 
 The soldier of fortune 
 I guess I will always be 
 The soldier of 
 Fortune"
58,Opeth,metal,Coil,"She told me why she told me lies 
 Always take care of this 
 I told her how I've always stayed 
 Always waiting for nothing 
 When I get out of here 
 When I leave you behind 
 I'll find that the years passed us by 
 And I can see you 
 Riding through the fields of sorrow 
 When you get out of here 
 When you leave me behind 
 You'll find that the years passed us by 
 And I can see you 
 Riding through the fields of sorrow"
59,Opeth,metal,Heir Apparent,"Slow days 
 Slow words 
 Slow lies 
 Slow ends 
 So many years to clean the slate 
 Endless despair within its wake 
 His touch soiling what used to be clean 
 His gaze burning on the edge of our dreams no more 
 Slow pain 
 Slow deaths 
 And again he rides in, it's September and he covets the gullible 
 Skeletal wish 
 Hunter 
 A thousand lies, cast from the throne of secrecy 
 Hear him spewing forth meaning to miserable lies 
 See the twisted hand of doubt seal the affair 
 The insect trust 
 Believer 
 Your body a vehicle to house his disease 
 Pearls before swine they are nothing but blind 
 Submit to nothing and swallow my spit of scorn 
 Invisible king 
 Dying 
 Procession of woe, struck down by sorrow 
 A burden so great weighs heavy on old and withered beliefs 
 The swift solution crumbles beneath the mock notes of a masterpiece 
 Death in his eyes 
 Waiting 
 Spiraling judgement, provoked in the rains 
 This futile test drowned in the levee of deception 
 In the year of his sovereign 
 Rid us of your judgement 
 Heir apparent"
60,Opeth,metal,The Lotus Eater,"The liquid is in your throat 
 One hopeless delight 
 After all you fell in love with death, 
 Life has aborted. 
 All you've had and all you became, 
 The night is calling, you pray for it. 
 A barren waste is your land 
 Your crops, they were sown to die 
 The skin is a mirror 
 Empty eyes hollow with ignorance 
 Health runs from your lips 
 Tucked in and safe in a world of sleep 
 All those years caring for a liar 
 A benefit road that is winding higher 
 You're a moth too close to the fire 
 You are stuck in a route of confusion 
 Changing and waiting and seeking the truth of it all 
 Fleeing your sorrows 
 Pushing your spirit away 
 The weakness of the psyche 
 A whisper from the heart of evil luring them all into despair 
 Resenting the goods of a savior 
 And cries out 
 For the restless will also die 
 A selection culled from the damned, drawing a lifeline of one 
 A friend died in your room and sought the birth of a follower 
 O brother, you are a killer and you target yourself 
 I wish you had never come back for us to see the beckoning end 
 And the pride of a mother brought flaws in a mother's son 
 And the love from a father was used by a father's son 
 Overheard us talking in a smoke of lost hope 
 The language of a parting so clear and so true 
 Overheard us talking"
61,Opeth,metal,Burden,"I, once upon a time 
 Carried a burden inside 
 I sung a last goodbye 
 A broken rhyme I had underlined 
 There's an ocean of sorrow in you 
 A sorrow in me 
 I saw a movement in their eyes 
 That said I no longer knew the way 
 I had given up the ghost 
 A passive mind submit to fear 
 And the wait for redemption at hand 
 Waiting to fail 
 Failing again 
 If death should take me now 
 Count my mistakes and let me through 
 Whisper in my ear 
 You have taken more than we've received 
 And the ocean of sorrow is you"
62,Opeth,metal,Porcelain Heart,"I lost all I had (that April day) 
 I turned to my friends (nothing to say) 
 I wrote down a name (and read it twice) 
 I wallowed in shame... 
 I said that I loved (eternal schemes) 
 I cling to my past (like childish dreams) 
 I promised to stay (and held my breath) 
 I went far away... 
 Icy roads beneath my feet 
 Lead me through wastelands of deceit 
 Rest your head now - don't you cry 
 Don't ever ask the reason why 
 Kept inside our idle race 
 Ghost of an idol's false embrace 
 Rest your head now - don't you cry 
 Don't ever ask the reason why"
63,Opeth,metal,Hessian Peel,"Will the children cry 
 When their mother dies 
 And in the autumn of their lives 
 Will they feel the same

 Come back tonight 
 My sweet Satan 
 I see you) 
 Her longing for me coming down like hail 
 Why did you leave me 
 Come here inside and tell me how 
 How in my final days 
 I'd find the rhyme 
 The light comes on 
 The signal for us to act out our lives 
 You wait beneath the white sheets and you wait forever 
 The light comes on 
 Your weakness 
 Storing trace on your arms 
 So I left you alone 
 We all left you alone

 (They're no longer your reason why) 
 Lock the children away from harm 
 They're no longer your reason why 
 Seeking tenderness with a dagger 
 Skin is marked by the years of trials 
 You felt abandoned in a flock of friends 
 Singing praise for the dead 
 Awaited the face of the moon to ascend 
 And followed the sound in your head"
64,Opeth,metal,Hex Omega,"Two years in your heart 
 One moment of doubt 
 Two lives torn apart 
 One second from now 
 Held him in your arms 
 Your fever subsides 
 Always safe from harm 
 Kept demons inside 
 Still you always start running 
 Towards the light from the moon 
 We saw a mother cry 
 And left a space here"
65,Opeth,metal,Derelict Herds,"Someone died for looking too far 
 While I was asleep in my house 
 A child was killed, I heard it from a friend 
 A war raged in a distant land 
 Caused me to linger on a piece of text 
 Someone died 
 Not here, never here 
 There was a fever 
 There is a failure 
 Are you a believer? 
 Then someone lied to you 
 You hold it closer to your chest 
 There was a meaning for this test 
 But you forgot and it's gone now 
 You were controlled somehow 
 There was a mean time 
 An invitation of sorts 
 I remember life 
 I, I was sick with sorrow 
 I'd fallen asleep 
 And dreamt of my sins here 
 It was your turn 
 Adamant smile and said, ""Thank you"" 
 There was a sickness right in the family 
 While I shuddered in the cold 
 Woman hanged for her sins while I craved mine 
 An old man drowned in this life herd 
 As I made amends with my fathers 
 Someone died 
 Not here, never here"
66,Opeth,metal,Bridge Of Sighs,"The sun don't shine 
 The moon don't move the tides 
 To wash me clean 
 Sun don't shine 
 The moon don't move the tides 
 To wash me clean 
 Why so unforgiving and why so cold? 
 Been a long time crossing 
 The bridge of sighs 
 Cold wind blows 
 The gods look down in anger 
 On this poor child 
 Cold wind blows 
 Gods look down in anger 
 On this poor child 
 Why so unforgiving and why so cold? 
 Been a long time crossing 
 The bridge of sighs"

 Genom livet 
 När det alltid känns som höst 
 Då vänder sej vinden sakta mot norr 
 Och blommorna dör 
 Det faller regn i mina drömmar 
 Jag måste resa igen 
 Och leta efter tröst 
 Jag måste leta igen 
 Efter ömhetens röst 
 Jag måste resa igen 
 Till nästa höst 
 Den ständiga resan 
 Till nästa höst 
 När jag vandrar på den steniga vägen 
 Genom livet 
 När det känns som jag bar på en sorg 
 Då gömmer sej solen sakta i moln 
 Och ordet är adjö 
 Snart faller snö i mina drömmar 
 Jag måste resa igen 
 Och leta efter tröst 
 Jag måste leta igen 
 Efter ömhetens röst 
 Jag måste resa igen 
 Till nästa höst 
 Den ständiga resan 
 Till nästa höst 
 Den ständiga resan 
 Till nästa höst"
68,Opeth,metal,The Devil's Orchard,"This trail is obsidian, the grip of Winter uncoiled 
 A lover would follow me 
 Cast down and sworn to the dark 
 Take the road where devils speak 
 ""God is dead"" 
 The wealth of darkness 
 Inside you, telling you ""now"" 
 Your senses corrupted 
 Controlling a poisonous will 
 Take the road where devils speak 
 ""God is dead"" 
 In the corner of my eye 
 You are tearing flesh from bone 
 Led the blind in search to find 
 A pathway to the sun 
 Saw the signs intertwine 
 And forgave me all my sins 
 No stigmas revealing our vices 
 And there are no stigmas revealing our vices 
 God is dead"
69,Opeth,metal,I Feel The Dark,"I feel the dark when I see you 
 I feel the dark when I see you 
 Looser the harness of trust 
 Survey an impulse of lust 
 The thespian is far away 
 Uprooted yet forced to stay 
 Sing a lie, ghost of the night 
 Give yourself to me 
 The road is long and winding still 
 And these bonds will start to fray 
 But another day 
 A flaking wish inside 
 Veiled comes the daylight through the glass 
 In the never-ending rain 
 This is no friend of mine 
 Stalking the comfort within 
 A flaking wish inside 
 The mother of lies 
 And you're going out to war 
 When the beast is coming home 
 And the sun is seen no more 
 For the devil's love you bore 
 I feel the dark when I see you"
70,Opeth,metal,Slither,"Summer's gone and love has withered 
 I believe in nothing yet nothing is what it seems 
 All is gone and promises slithered 
 You gave me nothing yet nothing is what it seems 
 Summer is gone 
 Your eyes gave away all your lies in the end 
 The dawning of a seething design 
 Kept a secret from the light 
 And felt the weight on my shoulders increase 
 A bleeding heart led by desperation 
 Like a bird on a wire 
 A broken promise of dedication 
 Never ever again"
71,Opeth,metal,Nepenthe,"Hope would fail me in the falling snow 
 And slake a wish inside 
 Friends would leave me in my darkest hour 
 Yet trust me with their lives 
 She would haunt my dreams and feed my demons 
 They tell me to go"
72,Opeth,metal,Häxprocess,"A lifeline in a drop of blood 
 A dying wish to shun a God 
 Sought a dream inside the light 
 Finally relieved from plight 
 O this night is deceiving 
 One eternal Winter 
 Earth below and reeling 
 Moon is riding high 
 Father and a liar 
 One forgotten season 
 Secrets in the mire 
 Moon is riding high 
 Aligning 
 A name inside a memory 
 Waiting for you 
 When words can't win her love 
 There is nothing to do 
 Save your children 
 Drenched in poverty 
 Tracks in the snow 
 Leading them to woe"
73,Opeth,metal,Famine,"I can't see your face 
 And I can't breathe your air 
 So I wonder why I get cold inside 
 When I hear your name 
 When we meet eye to eye 
 I will ask how and why 
 And when guilt has its way 
 One lesser reason to stay 
 And I will see her cry 
 Into the fire of our youth comes the devil again 
 And you feel your way, feel your way 
 Saw you standing nigh 
 In the corner 
 Told me that you had died 
 And I would die when my heart was empty 
 Become a ghost in perpetual void 
 And neglect all reasons why"
74,Opeth,metal,The Lines In My Hand,"We are dying in the wake of gods and decrees remain arcane 
 And everything around us is a consequence of pain 
 The writings on the wall depict a truth that no one reads 
 A government of puppets blinded by another creed 
 Burning voice of insanity 
 Nothing is the same 
 Barren lands for the idle man 
 Find all the lines in your hand 
 Blinding storms are surrounding us 
 Take control 
 In our cups, poisoned wine 
 Find all the lines in your hands"
75,Opeth,metal,Folklore,"Hey you, will you be true 
 When you can see through what I do 
 Feel the pain in your brain, insane 
 Will I see my name in your scars 
 And you will see what you mean to me 
 Lust between the lines 
 Do you feel the need 
 When the night comes down 
 And when the night comes down 
 A father is waiting 
 And you will see what you mean to me 
 Lost control and called your name 
 Left a home in the pouring rain 
 In a sea of guilt and shame 
 Will we sustain"
76,Opeth,metal,Pyre,"Follow the embers into cities of dreams 
 What you've been seeing is not all what it seems 
 Dawn of the liars 
 Future's a pyre 
 Outside the window I see people passing by 
 If they could see me now they'd break down and cry 
 Familiar voices beat behind the wall of sleep 
 I wish this beating would flow to me with the love I keep 
 Look down your senses 
 Await the gritting beyond 
 And in the morning this starkness would trail alone 
 Born as a failure and dying as a stranger 
 When your country's bleeding while you're forced to mourn 
 Outside the window I see people passing by 
 If they could see me now they'd break down and cry 
 Familiar voices beat behind the wall of sleep 
 I wish this beating would flow to me with the love I keep 
 ""Bring me back again"""
77,Opeth,metal,Face In The Snow,"No more wishes for the past 
 No lingering of sages and seers 
 And desperations and fevers last, 
 The undertows are stronger here. 
 And here I lie, another morning arrives 
 Too far away from coming home 
 I see a face in the snow, inside my head a voice calls for me 
 I see your face in the snow and outside the sun's too far away to feel 
 And here I lie, another morning arrives, 
 Too far away from coming home. 
 And here I lie, another morning arrives, 
 Too far away from coming home 
 And could we live within the wake of aging lies 
 When we're too far away?"
78,Opeth,metal,Eternal Rains Will Come,"Eternal rains will come 
 We should say goodbye 
 And suffer on our own 
 As all our thoughts were wrong 
 So hard to keep the darkness from seeping through 
 And when the flood comes to drown us 
 There is nothing we can do 
 You told me not to wait 
 Unless I could wait forever 
 Because there is no time for us 
 Take comfort in what was 
 So hard to keep the darkness from seeping through 
 When the flood comes to drown us 
 There is nothing we can do 
 Here it comes, our death comes 
 And in my sleep I can't forget 
 Reaching for the surface, I see you"
79,Opeth,metal,Cusp Of Eternity,"A child of autumn was born 
 Into a world of deceit and death 
 And a land of lies 
 A break of bonds would take her away 
 And install a sense of loss and eternal sorrow 
 She walks across the country 
 She holds her head up high in the rain 
 A mother is screaming for help 
 She turns around to stare 
 At a scene from her memory 
 She is hiding a wish in her heart 
 That flows through her blood always 
 And it's culled from a dream 
 That someone is waiting to say her name 
 And call her to his side at the cusp of eternity"
80,Opeth,metal,"Moon Above, Sun Below","You are sleeping unhampered by guilt 
 Comes the morning you shut down 
 The devil's breath, a disease on your lips 
 Reaching out for your loss 
 You prey on your flock 
 Seeking out the weaker hearts 
 With eternity in your grip 
 And on a lifelong throne of sub-religion 
 They will eat from your head 
 Your head 
 With the moon above and the sun below 
 With the moon above and the sun below 
 With the moon above and the sun below 
 With the moon above and the sun below 
 I can't remember the sun upon my skin 
 Slave to a sorrow that is whispering within 
 I'm always waiting for you before I sleep 
 There is no comfort in the distance that we keep 
 In a river of grief I am drowning 
 And your grip is surrounding my heart 
 Balancing on the edge of failure 
 And relieved, should I fall 
 Scattered dust upon my eyes 
 A winding road taking you nowhere 
 A winding road taking me home 
 And home is my grave 
 Waiting for a day when there is nothing left to say 
 Voices of despair is a familiar friendship 
 A society in your head holds the code to destruction 
 Dying fast 
 Summer dying fast 
 And this can't last 
 As nothing ever lasts 
 In a forest of flesh 
 There is a need to sever 
 Myself away from happiness 
 Still no drifting sun 
 Black upon the earth 
 Still the air is dry 
 And the locust wait 
 Oh, no no no 
 Oh, no no no 
 There is no help in the wake of our needs 
 There is no help to dispel the pain 
 There is no help yet some cling to a phantom 
 There is no help 
 Oh, no no no 
 Oh, no no no 
 Only circles on the water 
 Only circles on the water 
 Only circles on the water 
 Only circles on the water 
 Only circles on the water 
 Only circles on the water"
81,Opeth,metal,Elysian Woes,"What is left when the morning comes 
 Is the memory of a future 
 When the web, when my plight is done 
 There is nothing left to hold onto 
 There were friends waiting at my door 
 They are gone now, for the year is new 
 I stuck by my word and when the rains came 
 Made it true and pure to dissolve the hurt 
 Are we nursing destruction? 
 Pursuing a dream we once had 
 Was it our intention 
 To follow this road till the end 
 Even if the end is a world of sorrow? 
 There is, there's a bond between us 
 Even if it's frayed, it's unbreakable 
 So I come, come for you always 
 And I welcome pain for a second of belonging somewhere 
 There were times when I lost my way 
 With hope pouring from my soul 
 A shelter from the sun 
 I don't want to bare my scars for you 
 I don't want to bare my scars for you 
 I don't want to bare my scars for you"
82,Opeth,metal,River,"Show me a sign 
 Of troubles in your heart 
 Spare me your lies 
 And tell me that you're mine 
 And our bodies float on the river 
 To the oceans of demise 
 Made me a slave 
 To the secrets of your silence 
 But you told me to stay 
 And you told me you're mine 
 And our bodies float on the river 
 To the oceans of demise 
 In light of all things to come 
 Why do you despair? 
 'Cause when you have no one 
 No one would care 
 Don't care 
 And all things will come undone 
 There is nothing to share 
 I'll be waiting for no one 
 And no one is there to care 
 Can't see, can't feel 
 You run, I long 
 I wait, he comes 
 Takes you away 
 'Cause he can feel you when you're on your way 
 He comes at you 
 In the embers of summer 
 All things must die 
 There's a passage of fire ahead 
 Fire on the other side 
 There comes a time when the river runs dry 
 Winter comes and we sacrifice 
 Our lives"
83,Opeth,metal,Voice Of Treason,"The mist is sleeping on the water 
 And winter's hiding in my heart 
 Thorns in my eyes are slowing me down 
 Can't pass through to the other side 
 She knows I'm the one who sought her 
 But when we fall, we'll fall so hard 
 She holds a secret and won't show me how 
 How to break the riddle in her eyes 
 This is treason 
 Of the mind and soul 
 Death is no reason 
 Why you go 
 Inside the ghost of love is laughing 
 It mocks the footsteps where I go 
 It tells me nothing has been lost 
 It whispers, 
 ""You've seen darkness before."" 
 In time the hurting will subside 
 And longing is overthrown 
 What's left is a void that grows inside 
 And the echo of a failure 
 This is treason 
 Of the mind and soul 
 Death is no reason 
 Why you go 
 Have you ever had the feeling of a sorrow inside? 
 Have you ever been the reason why a hope subsides? 
 Have you ever seen the aftermath of giving up? 
 Have we given up? 
 Is it over? 
 Have you given up? 
 Is winter hiding in your heart?"
84,Opeth,metal,Faith In Others,"The grave of our youth is up ahead 
 And life has become a burden 
 We move in circles of suppressed despair 
 Waiting for the sun 
 And turning stones to find evidence 
 But it hides in the recesses of our hearts 
 A written decree of our loss 
 And we carried no faith in the cross 
 And the cold years are coming 
 For the victims of a longing 
 Out through the doors of starvation 
 Into the rains of damnation 
 Where the bitter winds are singing 
 For the victims of a longing 
 Ooh, ooh 
 Ooh, ooh 
 Ooh, ooh 
 Ooh, ooh 
 We carried along through squalor 
 With an inborn need to dominate and possess 
 It gives birth to an anger inside 
 We can't control this 
 The blood of departure in our tracks 
 Dripping from our emptying vessels 
 Your hand reached out to hold mine 
 But you're grasping melting ice 
 Asleep in the rain 
 A child once again 
 And the ghost in my head 
 Has forgiven me 
 Lifted his curse upon me"

 That you thrive in chaos 
 You're a sorceress 
 And your eye is on the lost 
 But you're dying 
 It's in your eyes 
 You're a charlatan 
 You get everything you wish 
 You're a harlot 
 Carry poison in your kiss 
 Beg forgiveness 
 With a dagger in your hand 
 Sow your death seed 
 And reap the dying lands 
 But you're crying 
 It's only vice 
 Empty vessel drained of hope 
 And none the lesser at the end of a rope 
 Have you ever hated like I? 
 Know I still awaited the absence of lies 
 Watch your eager tongue 
 Attack me from behind 
 Riddle whispers 
 Bleak futile control 
 Like a twin sister 
 Adapting to a role 
 You're a murderer

 You're a harvester 
 Come close to spread disease 
 And you're hiding 
 I hear you cry"
87,Opeth,metal,The Wilde Flowers,"Sun hangs high, I turn away 
 Failure underground 
 Heart is sick and fever is high 
 Waiting for a sound 
 Like a trail of insects to me 
 I watch them from afar 
 Feeding, breeding, scheming 
 Tell me I am wrong 
 Hiding from discovery 
 Staring down into the ground 
 Had they seen the poison in me 
 A tide of spite wound be found 
 Moving faster lingering gaze 
 Feasting on my sanity 
 A grain of sand against endless waves 
 A wish for the slaughter of conformity 
 Blinding light as the flames grow higher 
 Searing skin on a funeral pyre 
 Blinding light as the flames grow higher 
 Searing skin on a funeral pyre 
 Inside me sleeps a violence waiting to be freed

 Blinding light as the flames grow higher 
 Searing skin on a funeral pyre 
 Blinding light as the flames grow higher 
 Searing skin on a funeral pyre 
 Blinding light and the flames grow higher 
 Searing skin on a funeral pyre 
 Should I speak and they'll call me a liar 
 I'll retreat to my funeral pyre 
 My sanctuary, a thousand centuries

 I'm not waiting, I'm tired of waiting 
 I'm not waiting, I'm tired of waiting 
 I'm not waiting"
88,Opeth,metal,Will O The Wisp,"When you're tired of waiting 
 And time is not on your side 
 When you're tired of hating me 
 You no longer want to hide 
 You're stuck to the failures of your life 
 Marred with the sorrows of your strife 
 And time it waits for no one 
 It heals them when you die 
 And soon you are forgotten 
 A whisper within a sigh 
 When there's trouble admitting 
 That you have been wrong all along 
 When the words you have written down 
 Reads ""everything is gone"" 
 You're stuck to the failures of your life 
 Marred with the sorrows of your strife 
 And time it waits for no one 
 It heals them when you die 
 And soon you are forgotten 
 A whisper within a sigh 
 And time it waits for no one 
 It heals them when you die 
 And soon you are forgotten 
 A whisper within a sigh 
 When you smother your friendships 
 And take much more than you need 
 When you can't keep a secret to yourself 
 And points to the source of the deed 
 You're stuck to the failures of your life 
 Marred with the sorrows of your strife 
 And you can never find the satisfaction 
 When you can't outgrow your false distractions 
 You know your soul is weighed on the silver scale of deceit and lies"
89,Opeth,metal,Chrysalis,"And on the furthest day when you lay down 
 Discard your disarray and your rusted crown 
 And face the wretched image of you and I 
 No trust in what you say, you are a dead poison seed 
 Stronger when you are away, you have nothing that I need 
 The rhyme has settled in the ghost of a sigh 
 Nothing now remains, now you will leave me be 
 Sunrise into the moonlight 
 A broken body lies in wait 
 Your prize won you the stark night 
 And you made peace with your fate 
 Blind eyes sensitive only to white light 
 Reacting just a bit too late 
 Preying on insecurity, a design of your schemes 
 A true believer of purity must tend to what it means 
 Or allow its gospel to turn into a lie 
 You forsake everything you feel in favor of despair 
 Immune and blind to everything that is real in your secret lair 
 And cast away the captive heart that was thine 
 And you will go and leave me be 
 Winter in your soul, building a wasteland 
 And you tread a thin ice 'neath your feet 
 Sneering, and everyone you would shun 
 Collecting flowers to your wreath 
 Lifeline, a river cuts deep in your cold hand 
 It is changing when you try to breathe 
 Leave it all behind you, there is comfort in giving up 
 A seed in a barren soil might curl up into a coil 
 Flourish into something new 
 Give back what you thought was ""you"" 
 And give way to all that is new 
 Leave it all behind you..."
90,Opeth,metal,Sorceress 2,"Until I take my final breath 
 In a year or even less 
 I hope you will give me all your time 
 And do not forget me down the line

 Or if you will cry when I go away 
 Until I take my final breath 
 In a year or even less 
 I hope you will give me all your time 
 And do not forget me down the line 
 And I will never ask you if you will stay 
 Or if you will cry when I go away 
 Ice melting into the sea 
 Your river flowing back to me 
 And when you take your final breath 
 In many years from now, no less 
 I hope you feel a peace at heart 
 Don't be afraid to kiss the dark 
 And don't ever wonder if I stayed 
 My love for you can not die away"
91,Opeth,metal,The Seventh Sojourn,"Hold me in your arms 
 Never do me harm 
 Never do me harm 
 Hold me in your arms 
 A raging sea in your eyes 
 Gives away your disguise 
 Grants me the peace to leave 
 And finally leave you be"
92,Opeth,metal,Strange Brew,"An afternoon walk through the park 
 I keep to the shadows until it's dark 
 I am not educated nor free of sin 
 I carry thoughts of giving in 
 There is a void surrounding me 
 No sound, and in the black I can not see 
 There is a chasm between you and me 
 You have no face, no body, no words to speak 
 There is a wickedness in me 
 I can't seem to make it go away 
 I am a spiritual leper but I can see 
 A flock of believers gone astray 
 There's eternal night in my gaze 
 I'm cast out and I am not like you 
 Find my way on through the haze 
 I'm liquefied in a strange brew 
 An early morn walk through the park 
 I look to the sun when it is cold and stark 
 I blend with the crows of robot minds 
 Never a leader, I am always behind 
 A voice through the rain tells me I'm here 
 A glance from a veil brings me to tears 
 A voice through the rain tells me I'm here 
 A glance from a veil brings me to tears 
 A voice through the rain tells me I'm here 
 A glance from a veil brings me to tears 
 A voice through the rain tells me I'm here 
 A glance from a veil brings me to tears"
93,Opeth,metal,A Fleeting Glance,"Up until recently I have been alone 
 Leading a tranquil life but never at home 
 Something had changed and I turned to the wind 
 That blew through me and told me, ""How long? How long?"" 
 Silenced the voice of my heart now for years 
 I was perplexed by a fleeting blank stare 
 Biding my time until courage had build up inside me 
 Then came clean, ""Or am I wrong"" 
 I spend all my days contemplating my will 
 For the weak shall inherit the earth when it's still 
 A government bid for my life 
 I was sold as a cog in a machine, ""I walk the line"" 
 A fleeting glance again (Tells me everything) 
 Took a chance in vain (Drown to a futile idea) 
 A pursuit of happiness (As the storm rolls in) 
 An idol of helplessness (Paved the way and then gave in) 
 I met with my mother and I asked her why 
 For ten years so more she would never reply 
 Suddenly she said we are all born to die 
 Gave me purpose, freed me, ""How simple it can be"" 
 But it's fading away from my mind 
 There's another ""me"" waiting behind 
 But it's fading away from my mind 
 There's another ""me"" waiting behind"
94,Opeth,metal,Era,"There's a sign in the rain 
 Every now and again 
 It is a symbol of hope 
 In the midst of a catastrophic episode 
 In the hour of death 
 There's a spiritual wealth 
 When we dance through the rain 
 And form the signs once again 
 If even for a second 
 I hear a voice on the air 
 It has a warning to share 
 ""Don't believe what you see"" 
 ""You can't perceive what you feel"" 
 But if I do what I'm told 
 And shun the spirit I hold 
 I'm no longer a human 
 And I will not shift with the sands 
 The end of an era 
 One starts anew 
 You know the devil 
 He lives in you 
 The end of an era 
 One starts anew 
 You know the devil 
 He lives in you 
 There are moments of doubt when I don't know what to do 
 And giving in is the only way out 
 When there's too much shouting about how I should choose 
 Incapacitated, I'm left behind 
 In a sea of hatred I go blind 
 A storm is coming, I hide away 
 In the years of need reason leads astray 
 The end of an era 
 One starts anew 
 You know the devil 
 He lives in you 
 The end of an era 
 One starts anew 
 You know the devil 
 He lives in you 
 He lives in you 
 He lives in you"
95,Opeth,metal,Persephone (Slight Return),"The years went by with disquieting grace 
 A past obsession sunk without a trace 
 I moved into winter and found my home 
 As my boiling blood had turned to chrome"
96,Opeth,metal,The Ward,"I am going away, I am going down 
 I am going away, I am going down 
 Sifting through a memory before it fades away 
 Adolescent secrecy, a million words astray 
 I can't remember happiness, I thrive within the dark 
 The security of a loneliness is a veil that keeps my calm 
 By the way, I'm doing fine 
 I have a place to stay, just behind the sunshine 
 And by the way, I don't need sympathy 
 I have a place to lay, I have more than you can see 
 I walk the streets alone at night, it helps to ease my mind 
 I lay me down come the morning light and leave all woes behind"
97,Opeth,metal,Spring MCMLXXIV,"On a wind that's sailing through the morning 
 I have cut the harness off of my heart 
 On a tide that's rising with the dawning 
 I find I belong inside the dark 
 And when the waves roll in to cover me in shame 
 I avoid another sign of the efforts made in vain 
 I am just another ripple in the current of an age 
 Another crossed out name on another wrinkled page 
 Carry me home 
 Carry me home 
 Carry me home 
 Carry me home 
 Carry me home 
 Carry me home 
 Carry me home 
 Carry me home 
 There's a dream that tells me I'm haunted 
 It comes to visit every fortnight or so 
 I wake up having lost all I have ever wanted 
 And a bleak apparition wants what I hold 
 And when the waves roll in to cover me in shame 
 I avoid another sign of the efforts made in vain 
 I am just another ripple in the current of an age 
 Another crossed out name on another wrinkled page 
 Carry me home 
 Carry me home 
 Carry me home 
 Carry me home 
 Carry me home 
 Carry me home 
 Carry me home 
 Carry me home 
 Should it disappear, should it go away? 
 Would it mend the wounds I bare, the wound of love? 
 Could it reappear like a familiar tale? 
 Like a broken friendship that snuffs the moonlight above"
98,Opeth,metal,Would?,"Know me broken by my master 
 Teach thee on child of love hereafter 
 Into the flood again 
 Same old trip it was back then 
 So I made a big mistake 
 Try to see it once my way 
 Drifting body it's sole desertion 
 Flying not yet quite the notion 
 Into the flood again 
 Same old trip it was back then 
 So I made a big mistake 
 Try to see it once my way 
 Into the flood again 
 Same old trip it was back then 
 So I made a big mistake 
 Try to see it once my way 
 Am I wrong? 
 Have I run too far to get home 
 Have I gone? 
 And left you here alone 
 Am I wrong? 
 Have I run too far to get home, yeah 
 Have I gone? 
 And left you here alone 
 If I would, could you?"
