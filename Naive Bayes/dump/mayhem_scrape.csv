 The mouth - screams so silent 
 Tell me! - what did you see there? 
 In the darkness - of the past 
 Ancient times legends stories so dark 
 Blackened his sight, now 
 Not even the memories are left 
 Back after such a long time 
 The stone is cold as death 
 But what formed it's true fears 
 Only the wind is able to tell"

 Will I ever reach the land beyond? 
 This is where we go when we have to die 
 I've been old since the birth of time, time buried me in earth 
 Centuries ago, I tasted blood, buried by time and dust 
 Many years has pasted since the funeral missing the blood of human throats 
 So many years, ages ago, I must await, feel my bodies stench 
 Wanderings out of space, wandering out of time 
 A world out of light, death at the end 
 Only silence can be heard, silence of peoples' tears 
 No one knows my grave buried by time and dust"

 By the powers of lingering trauma 
 I looked beyond the dawn of day 
 Beyond the angstridden faces 
 Into the mind captured behind 
 Living the lie of the weakened ones 
 I captured the moment given 
 I denied the sickening love 
 Turned to the purity of anger 
 I saw myself in the abyss 
 Complete fullness I now own 
 I return to earth a demonrace 
 Denied by man through ages 
 Now I walk the dying soil 
 Atrocities turned beauty 
 Machines of torture turned art 
 Beneath your cities I sleep 
 At dawn I weep..."

20,Mayhem,metal,In The Lies Where Upon You Lay,"In the century where man dies 
 We the huntress of the hollow hills 
 Must put ourselves above pity

 We must be again as once were 
 We the soul of the earth 
 As reaping time descends 
 The sour gain of mercy withers 
 Into the night we must go into the darkest abyss 
 To a level of consciousness unknown to Christendom 
 We want life we crush the dream of heaven 
 As we bring the blade down one swift move 
 We are the chosen ones chosen by will to life 
 You life lairs crawl on you banded knees 
 As you finally die you will eventually have lost more 
 By not living by the sword than what you lose in death 
 Not by mercy by strength we end your pity lives 
 Not by spirit by flesh we awaken the beast within 
 Knee deep in your repulsive blood we march 
 Victorious by the power of our minds and bodies 
 Watch the twilight of your god 
 As you system cracks and all your life is dead priest 
 Take a look into our minds

 Feel your life drained of everything that was

50,Mayhem,metal,MILAB,"Flashback of lights 
 Phantom halos come to life 
 Black piercing eyes 
 Nocturnal visit of the fourth kind 
 Petrified paralyzed 
 I hover above beyond myself 
 On the chrome altar 
 The seed of implanted 
 I was chosen to carry 
 They told me to be proud 
 Behind lights are shapes of horrors 
 No feelings no emotions 
 Spikes of electrodes 
 Injected into the skull 
 Encoded amnesis 
 Hall of nightmares 
 Dark rift of the soul 
 Ascension 
 Descension"
51,Mayhem,metal,VI.Sec.,"My soul slips into 
 The Morphing Aether

 Six seconds to life 
 Six seconds till death"
52,Mayhem,metal,Throne Of Time,"Hypnotic radio waves 
 To conquer all minds 
 Turning on the coils 
 Antenna of delta time 
 All psy-kids are linked 
 The Throne is lighting up 
 Brain waves in hyperspace 
 Transmitting fear 
 Total mass manipulation 
 Endless tears 
 Millions of children caged under the ground 
 Nerve drugged into psy-trance 
 Sexual cultivation of creative force 
 Satanic ritual abuse 
 Psychotic Master Mind 
 Behind the false memories 
 The will of man is broken 
 Esoteric warfare"
53,Mayhem,metal,Corpse Of Care,"Dull care is slain 
 By the power 
 Of our ancient rites 
 One flame alone 
 Must light this pyre 
 Of pure eternal flame 
 Bring fire! 
 Our funeral pyre awaits the corpse of Care 
 Ferried across the shadowy tide 
 In all the ancient majesty of death 
 Fools! Ye burn me once again! 
 Me ye cannot slay 
 I spit upon 
 Your fire! 
 In the flames that eat thine effigy 
 We will read the sign: 
 Midsummer 
 Sets us free!"

 Emerging singularity 
 End of evolution

55,Mayhem,metal,Aion Suntelia,"Cast down between two worlds 
 Across the dark son of awareness 
 The body hologram born 
 From the dust of a dying star 
 Neverending now of infinite illusions 
 Free to tremble in fear and pain 
 Limited by misfortune 
 Flawed by design 
 Lost in a lost world 
 Gods in exile 
 Feed on the weak 
 And the wounded 
 Quarantined in the 
 Labyrinth of time 
 Set free from gravity's weight 
 Alchemical wedding 
 Of crystalline heavy light"

59,Mayhem,metal,Completion In Science Of Agony (Preproduction Version),"Do you hear with eyes? 
 The universe is crunching 
 After the war... silence 
 Not in the black hole of stretched time 
 You ones had blood in your veins 
 The blood so black it hurts 
 Remembrance is torn away 
 I offer cosmos in my design 
 Chromosome needles in your arms 
 The suffering of a thousand voices 
 My science hurts 
 Values arises from pain 
 Birth is pain 
 Kaosconstruction not my game 
 No fairytales from dust dead books 
 Birth is pain 
 All the stars in the north died 
 We move towards a new constellation"

 In the garden of the prophet 
 Divine madness... 
 The order of the cosmic immoral 
 For what is humanity 
 If not forlorn 
 And crawling to my hands 
 When the moment sings 
 For I have read the signs 
 And I have solved the riddle 
 Of eternal life 
 The Jinnah have spoken 
 For I have read the signs 
 And I have solved the riddle 
 Of eternal life... 
 (From The Dark Past) 
 A face in stone... decayed by age 
 A man who has returned to tell of his damnation 
 Fears so deep, the mouth open wide 
 The scream died away before dawn of this time 
 The eyes - stares so empty 
 The mouth - screams so silent 
 Tell me! - what did you see there? 
 In the darkness - of the past 
 Ancient times legends stories so dark 
 Blackened his sight, now 
 Not even the memories are left 
 Back after such a long time 
 The stone is cold as death 
 But what formed it's true fears 
 Only the wind is able to tell"

65,Mayhem,metal,Mayhem,"Avatars of powers from four worlds 
 Bathed me in jewels of belief 
 I drink the nectar of Goddess - my eternal mistress 
 I am Shiva, Hadit or Beast himself 
 And multitude of forms surpasses myself 
 I kneel before Isis, I - her god and slave 
 Coiled serpent lifts up his head and looks in my eyes 
 Third power and third eye create The One 
 I am who I am not 
 I negate and confirm 
 I transgress - it is real! 
 Wheels of change turn with my breath 
 I touch the red - hot firmament (of golden darkenings of 
 Heavens) 
 And stars are falling down onto every side of world 
 With my tongue I penetrate scarlet abysses of Kteis 
 Overflowing my body with thrill and heart with warmth 
 Suddenly I'm shooting forth venom 
 'Cause I, I became a snake who rounds her flesh

 That's why I write from morning till night 
 If I spat my new bars at a set 
 I would get a reload mostly all of the time 
 I remember my poorest rhymes 
 F**K hanging around with a 45 
 Us two fellas are big in da game 
 Deep bars make you cry like pores in your eyes 
 We're big in the game 
 We're too big for most kids in the game 
 We're moving quicker with eights 
 And we might end you in a lyrical way 
 This is big in the game the winners tune on the biggest of games 
 Were big like EA 
 Even ask sligidy slay 
 We're big like E.A 
 Mess get left in A.E 
 Wanna fight then its O.K 
 But I guarantee you will get K.O 
 And if you want war it's O.N 
 Merked by your crew N.O 
 U should know I'm an OG 
 So right now you should G.O 
 Don't act like your big in the game 
 Your not you chat shit and your just little and vain 
 And your names not as big as you claim 
 I've been in for three years your not spitting the 
 I know you want to get rid of my name 
 To do that you'll need heat like the middle of Spain 
 So step and you will get dropped better than my mixtape 
 Coming in the middle of May 
 So just give me a break, before I come with the sickest of mates 
 And wet you up like a christening mate 
 I'll be coming for you like the middle of eight 
 And gunning your crew like pries and Reyes 
 Beef? Come check me in my estate 
 Outside the youth club see me chilling with mase 
 And if it's raining catch me on Caldervale 
 Writing with Blizz and Sligidy Slay 
 Honest I'm too great so if I die everybody will suffer 
 Like I was bottom of the food chain 
 Listen I'm too big 
 I'm better than you, your 16 I'm a school kid 
 Yes little 'cause 
 Your going on too cold, no one can mess with you trust 
 'Cause we're big, big, big 
 Us man are big in the game 
 We're big like E.A 
 Mess get left in A.E 
 Wanna fight then its O.K

 Merked by your crew N.O 
 U should know I'm an OG 
 So right now you should G.O 
 3rd Verse 
 I'm known to be cold, I've said it before 
 Forget it I'm raw, I'm ready for war 
 Beef on the road I'll bury you all 
 That guy's cold my enemies thought 
 I'll raid your enemies Fort 
 But not your enemies brain your enemy's thoughts 
 Then I'll smash his head off the floor 
 And blood out his head it will pour 
 Big in the game I've said it before, forget it I'm raw 
 I'll bury you all 
 Shift and Blizz we're ready for war 
 Say something daft and end up in saw 
 I heard you want gold we're heading for 
 I heard you want gold we're heading for more 
 Platinum? Yes little 'cause platinum 
 So we gotta keep spitting 
 The right bar to the right beat 
 And hopefully get an award 
 We're big like E.A 
 Mess get left in A.E 
 Wanna fight then its O.K 
 But I guarantee you will get K.O 
 And if you want war it's O.N

 Die we won't die live

 Mortal voids live die 
 Buried deep beneath the fall of the snow 
 Burning lives burning
