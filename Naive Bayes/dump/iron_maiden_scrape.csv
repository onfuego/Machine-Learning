13,Iron Maiden,metal,Murders In The Rue Morgue,"I remember it as plain as day 
 Although it happened in the dark of the night 
 I was strolling through the streets of Paris 
 And it was cold it was starting to rain 
 And then I heard a piercing scream 
 And I rushed to the scene of the crime 
 But all I found was the butchered remains 
 Of two girls lay side by side 
 Murders in the Rue Morgue 
 Someone call the Gendarmes 
 Murders in the Rue Morgue 
 Run before the killers go free 
 There's some people coming down the street 
 At last there's someone heard my call 
 I can't understand why they're pointing at me 
 I never done nothing at all 
 But I must have got some blood on my hands 
 Because everyone's shouting at me 
 I can't speak French, so I couldn't explain 
 And like a fool, I started running away 
 Murders in the Rue Morgue 
 Someone call the Gendarmes 
 Murders in the Rue Morgue 
 Am I ever gonna be free 
 And now I've gotta get away from the arms of the law 
 All France is looking for me 
 I've gotta find my way across the border for sure 
 Down the south to Italy 
 Murders in the Rue Morgue 
 Someone call the Gendarmes 
 Murders in the Rue Morgue 
 I'm never going home 
 Well I made it to the border at last 
 But I can't erase the scene from my mind 
 Anytime somebody stares at me, well 
 I just start running blind 
 Well I'm moving through the shadows at night 
 Away from the staring eyes 
 Any day they'll be looking for me 
 'Cause I know I show the signs of... 
 Murders in the Rue Morgue 
 Running from the Gendarmes 
 Murders in the Rue Morgue 
 Running from the arms of the law 
 Murders in the Rue Morgue 
 Running from the Gendarmes 
 Murders in the Rue Morgue 
 Am I ever gonna be free 
 It took so long and I'm getting so tired 
 I'm running out of places to hide 
 Should I return to the scene of the crime 
 Where the two young victims died 
 If I could go to somebody for help 
 It'd get me out of trouble for sure 
 But I know that it's on my mind 
 That my doctor said I've done it before 
 Murders in the Rue Morgue 
 They're never gonna find me 
 Murders in the Rue Morgue 
 I'm never going home"

 The mocking religion of hatred that burns in the night

 I can see what a knife's meant to be 
 You'll never know how I came to foresee, see, see

 The glimmer of metal my moment is ready to strike 
 The death call arising, a scream breaks the still of the night

 Excitement shakes me, oh God help me what have I done?! 
 Oh yeah, I've done it again!

24,Iron Maiden,metal,22 Acacia Avenue,"If you're feeling down, depressed, and lonely, 
 I know a place where we can go. 
 22, Acacia Avenue, meet a lady that I know. 
 So if you're looking for a good time, 
 And you're prepared to pay the price. 
 Fifteen quid is all she asks for, 
 Everybody's got their vice. 
 If you're waiting for a long time, 
 For the rest to do their piece. 
 You can tell her that you know me, 
 And you might even get it free. 
 So any time you're down the East End, 
 Don't you hesitate to go, 
 You can take my honest word for it, 
 She'll teach you more than you can know. 
 Charlotte, can't you get out from all this madness 
 Can't you see it only brings you sadness 
 When you entertain your men 
 Don't know the risk of getting disease? 
 Some day when you're reaching the age of forty 
 I bet you'll regret the days when you were laying 
 Nobody then will want to know 
 You wont have any beautiful wares to show any more 
 22, the Avenue, that's the place where we all go 
 You will find its warm inside, the red lights burning bright tonight. 
 Charlotte, isn't it time you stopped all this mad life. 
 Don't you ever think about the bad times. 
 Why do you have to live this way. 
 Do you enjoy the lay or is it the pay. 
 Sometimes when you're strolling down the avenue, 
 The way you walk, it makes men think of having you. 
 When you're walking down the street, 
 Everybody stops and turns to stare, at you. 
 22, the Avenue, that's the place where we all go. 
 You will find it's warm inside, 
 The red light's burning bright tonight. 
 Beat her, mistreat her, do anything that you please. 
 Bite her, excite her, make her get down on her knees. 
 Abuse her, misuse her, she can take all that you've got. 
 Caress her, molest her, she always does what you want. 
 You're running away, don't you know what you're doing? 
 Can't you see it'll lead you to ruin? 
 Charlotte, you've taken your life and you've thrown it away. 
 You believe that because what you're earning, 
 Your life's good, don't you know that you're hurting, 
 All the people that love you, don't cast them aside. 
 All the men that are constantly drooling, 
 It's no life for you, stop all that screwing. 
 You're packing your bags, you're coming with me."
25,Iron Maiden,metal,The #Of The Beast,"""Woe to you oh earth and sea 
 For the Devil sends the beast with wrath 
 Because he knows the time is short 
 Let him who hath understanding 
 Reckon the number of the beast 
 For it is a human number 
 Its number is six hundred-and-sixty-six."" 
 I left alone, my mind was blank 
 I needed time to think to get the memories from my mind 
 What did I see? Can I believe 
 That what I saw that night was real and not just fantasy? 
 Just what I saw, in my old dreams 
 Were they reflections of my warped mind starin' back at me? 
 'Cause in my dreams, it's always there 
 The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair 
 Yeah! 
 Night was black, was no use holdin' back 
 'Cause I just had to see, was someone watching me 
 In the mist, dark figures move and twist 
 Was all this for real, or just some kind of hell? 
 666, the number of the beast 
 Hell and fire was spawned to be released 
 Torches blazed and sacred chants were phrased 
 As they start to cry, hands held to the sky 
 In the night, the fires are burning bright 
 The ritual has begun, Satan's work is done 
 666, the number of the beast 
 Sacrifice is going on tonight 
 This can't go on, I must inform the law 
 Can this still be real or just some crazy dream? 
 But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes 
 Seem to mesmerize, can't avoid their eyes 
 666, the number of the beast 
 666, the one for you and me 
 I'm coming back, I will return 
 And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn 
 I have the fire, I have the force 
 I have the power to make my evil take its course"

 He brought us pain and misery 
 He killed our tribes, he killed our creed 
 He took our game for his own need 
 We fought him hard, we fought him well 
 Out on the plains, we gave him hell 
 But many came, too much for Cree 
 Oh, will we ever be set free? 
 Riding through dust clouds and barren wastes 
 Galloping hard on the plains 
 Chasing the redskins back to their holes 
 Fighting them at their own game 
 Murder for freedom, a stab in the back 
 Women and children, a coward's attack 
 Run to the hills 
 Run for your lives 
 Run to the hills 
 Run for your lives 
 Soldier blue in the barren wastes 
 Hunting and killing's a game 
 Raping the women and wasting the men 
 The only good Indians are tame 
 Selling them whiskey and taking their gold 
 Enslaving the young and destroying the old

 Dead men - tell no tales, 
 In Gangland - murder's up for sale. 
 Dead men - tell no tales, 
 In Gangland - where the jailbirds die. 
 Face at the window leers into your own. 
 But it's only your reflection, still you tremble in your bones. 
 How long can you hide? How long 'til they come? 
 A rat in a trap but you've got to survive. 
 Once you were glad to be free for a while. 
 The air tasted good and the world was your friend. 
 Then came the day when the hard times began. 
 Now you're alone but alive for how long? 
 A knife at your throat, another body on the pile. 
 A contract to keep and it's service with a smile. 
 Murder for vengeance or murder for gain. 
 Death on the streets or a blacked out jail. 
 Dead men - tell no tales, 
 In Gangland - murder's up for sale. 
 Dead men - tell no tales,

 In Gangland you tell no tales."

 When the priest comes to read me the last rites 
 (I) Take a look through the bars at the last sights 
 Of a world that has gone very wrong for me 
 Can it be that there's some sort of error? 
 Hard to stop the surmounting terror 
 Is it really the end, not some crazy dream? 
 Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming 
 It's not easy to stop from screaming 
 But words escape me when I try to speak 
 Tears fall, but why am I crying? 
 After all, I'm not afraid of dying 
 Don't I believe that there never is an end? 
 As the guards march me out to the courtyard 
 Somebody cries from a cell, ""God be with you"" 
 If there's a God, why has he let me go? 
 As I walk, my life drifts before me 
 Though the end is near, I'm not sorry 
 Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away 
 Mark my words, believe my soul lives on 
 Don't worry now that I have gone 
 I've gone beyond to see the truth 
 When you know that your time is close at hand 
 Maybe then you'll begin to understand

 Clutching their riches as they died

 Of engines roar in the night 
 The mission is near, the confident men 
 Are waiting to drop from the sky 
 The blizzard goes on, but still they must fly 
 No one should go where eagles dare 
 Bavarian Alps that lay all around 
 They seem to stare from below 
 The enemy lines a long time passed 
 Are lying deep in the snow 
 Into the night they fall through the sky 
 No one should fly where eagles dare 
 They're closing in, the fortress is near 
 It's standing high in the sky 
 The cable car's the only way in 
 It's really impossible to climb 
 They make their way, but may be too late 
 They've got to try to save the day 
 The panicking cries, the roaring of guns 
 Are echoing all around the valley 
 The mission complete, they make to escape 
 Away from the Eagles' Nest 
 They dared to go where no one would try 
 They chose to fly where eagles dare"

 Take not thy thunder from us

 Just a babe in a black abyss 
 No reason for a place like this 
 The walls are cold 
 And souls cry out in pain 
 An easy way for the blind to go 
 A clever path for the fools who know 
 The Secret of the Hangman 
 The smile on his lips 
 The light of the blind you'll see 
 The venom that tears my spine 
 The eyes of the Nile are opening 
 You'll see 
 She came to me with a serpent's kiss 
 As the Eye of the Sun rose on her lips 
 Moonlight catches silver tears I cry 
 So we lay in a black embrace 
 And the Seed is sown in a holy place 
 And I watched and I waited for the dawn 
 The light of the blind you'll see 
 The venom that tears my spine 
 The eyes of the Nile are opening 
 You'll see 
 Go! 
 Bind all of us together 
 Ablaze with Hope and Free 
 No storm or heavy weather

 Looks the old man in the eye 
 As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd 
 ""In the name of God my father I'll fly."" 
 His eyes seem so glazed 
 As he flies on the wings of a dream 
 Now he knows his father betrayed 
 Now his wings turn to ashes to ashes his grave

 On your way, like an eagle 
 Fly, touch the sun

 And the wolves they howled into the night 
 As they fought a vicious angry battle 
 To save the power of warmth and light 
 Drawn by quest for fire 
 They searched all through the land 
 Drawn by quest for fire 
 Discovery of man 
 And they thought that when the embers died away 
 That the flame of life had burnt and died 
 Didn't know the sparks that made the fire 
 Were made by rubbing stick and stone 
 So they ploughed through the forest and swamps of danger 
 And they fought the cannibal tribes and beasts 
 In the search to find another fire 
 To regain the power of light and heat 
 Drawn by quest for fire 
 They searched across the land 
 Drawn by quest for fire 
 Discovery of man 
 Drawn by quest for fire

 Fought for the splendour 
 Fought to the death."
44,Iron Maiden,metal,Back In The Village,"Turn the spotlights on the people, 
 Switch the dial and eat the worm, 
 Take your chances, kill the engine, 
 Drop your bombs and let it burn. 
 White flags shot to ribbons, 
 The truce is black and burned, 
 Shellshock in the kitchen, 
 Tables overturned. 
 Back in the village again, 
 In the village, 
 I'm back in the village again. 
 Throwing dice now, rolling loaded, 
 I see sixes all the way. 
 In a black hole, and I'm spinning 
 As my wings get shot away. 
 Questions are a burden 
 And answers are a prison for oneself 
 Shellshock in the kitchen 
 Tables start to burn. 
 Back in the village again, 
 In the village, 
 I'm back in the village again. 
 No breaks on the inside, 
 Paper cats and burning barns, 
 There's a fox among the chickens, 
 And a killer in the hounds. 
 Questions are a burden 
 And answers are a prison for oneself 
 Shellshock in the kitchen 
 Tables start to burn. 
 Back in the village again, 
 In the village, 
 I'm back in the village again. 
 But still we walk into the valley 
 And others try to kill the inner flame 
 We're burning brighter than before 
 I don't have a number, I'M A NAME! 
 Back in the village again, 
 In the village, 
 I'm back in the village again. 
 Back in the village again, 
 In the village, 
 I'm back in the village again. 
 Back in the village 
 I'm back in the village 
 I'm back in the village again."
45,Iron Maiden,metal,Powerslave,"Into the abyss I'll fall the eye of Horus 
 Into the eyes of the night watching me go 
 Green is the cat's eye that glows in this temple 
 Enter the risen Osiris risen again 
 Tell me, why I had to be a powerslave? 
 I don't wanna die, I'm a God, why can't I live on? 
 When the life giver dies, all around is laid to waste 
 And in my last hour, I'm a slave to the power of death 
 When I was living this lie, fear was my game 
 People would worship and fall drop to their knees 
 So bring me the blood and red wine for the one to succeed me 
 For he is a man and a God and he will die too 
 Tell me, why I had to be a powerslave? 
 I don't wanna die, I'm a God, why can't I live on? 
 When the life giver dies, all around is laid to waste 
 And in my last hour, I'm a slave to the power of death 
 Now I am cold, but a ghost lives in my veins 
 Silent the terror that reigned marbled in stone 
 A shell of a man God preserved a thousand ages 
 But open the gates of my Hell and I'll strike from the grave 
 Tell me, why I had to be a powerslave? 
 I don't wanna die, I'm a God, why can't I live on? 
 When the life giver dies, all around is laid to waste 
 And in my last hour, I'm a slave to the power of death 
 Slave to the power of death 
 Slave to the power of death"
46,Iron Maiden,metal,Rime Of The Ancient Mariner,"Hear the rime of the Ancient Mariner 
 See his eyes as he stops one of three 
 Mesmerizes one of the wedding guests 
 Stay here and listen to the nightmares 
 Of the sea. 
 And the music plays on, as the bride passes by 
 Caught by his spell and 
 The Mariner tells his tale. 
 Driven south to the land of the snow and ice 
 To a place where nobody's been 
 Through the snow fog flies on the albatross 
 Hailed in God's name, 
 Hoping good luck it brings. 
 And the ship sails on, back to the north 
 Through the fog and ice and 
 The albatross follows on 
 The mariner kills the bird of good omen 
 His shipmates cry against what he's done 
 But when the fog clears, they justify him 
 And make themselves part of the crime. 
 Sailing on and on and North across the sea 
 Sailing on and on and North till all is calm. 
 The albatross begins with its vengeance 
 A terrible curse a thirst has begun 
 His shipmates blame the bad luck on the Mariner 
 About his neck, the dead bird is hung. 
 And the curse goes on and on and on at sea, 
 And the thirst goes on and on for them and me. 
 ""Day after day, day after day, 
 We stuck nor breath nor motion 
 As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean 
 Water, water everywhere and 
 All the boards did shrink 
 Water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink."" 
 There, calls the Mariner, 
 There comes a ship over the line 
 But how can she sail with no wind 
 In her sails and no tide. 
 See... onward she comes 
 Onward she nears, out of the sun 
 See... she has no crew 
 She has no life, wait but there's two 
 Death and she life in Death, 
 They throw their dice for the crew 
 She wins the Mariner and he belongs to her now. 
 Then... crew one by one 
 They drop down dead, two hundred men 
 She... She, Life in Death, 
 She lets him live, her chosen one. 
 ""One after one by the star dogged moon, 
 Too quick for groan or sigh 
 Each turned his face with a ghastly pang, 
 And cursed me with his eye 
 Four times fifty living men 
 (And I heard nor sigh nor groan), 
 With heavy thump, a lifeless lump, 
 They dropped down one by one."" 
 The curse it lives on in their eyes 
 The Mariner he wished he'd die 
 Along with the sea creatures 
 But they lived on, so did he. 
 And by the light of the moon 
 He prays for their beauty not doom 
 With heart he blesses them 
 God's creatures all of them too 
 Then the spell starts to break 
 The albatross falls from his neck 
 Sinks down like lead into the sea 
 Then down in falls comes the rain 
 Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha 
 Hear the groans of the long dead seamen 
 See them stir and they start to rise 
 Bodies lifted by good spirits 
 None of them speak 
 And they're lifeless in their eyes. 
 And revenge is still sought, penance starts again 
 Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on. 
 Now the curse is finally lifted 
 And the Mariner sights his home 
 Spirits go from the long dead bodies 
 Form their own light and 
 The Mariner's left alone. 
 And then a boat came sailing towards him 
 It was a joy he could not believe 
 The pilots boat, his son and the hermit. 
 Penance of life will fall onto Him. 
 And the ship sinks like lead into the sea 
 And the hermit shrieves the Mariner of his sins. 
 The Mariner's bound to tell of his story 
 To tell his tale wherever he goes 
 To teach God's word by his own example 
 That we must love all things that God made. 
 And the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man 
 And the tale goes on and on and on."
47,Iron Maiden,metal,Rainbow's Gold,"In the heat of the morning 
 When your day is still dawning 
 And your bird, she's singing 
 Catch your soul, he's willing to fly away 
 Packed your bags in a hurry 
 Because your mind's in a worry 
 Mark my words, you're gonna be sorry if you ever fly away 
 Sweet little girl with the Saint Da Vinci-smile 
 Stares at me with sadness in her eyes 
 I'm not sure if she's really real or make-believe 
 Maybe she's a vision that comes to only me 
 'Cause I'm so tired 
 Yes I'm so tired 
 So tired 
 Yes I'm so tired

 Nicko: Listen, Bruce... 
 Bruce: Then 'e's out of order. 
 Nicko: Bruce...

 The swords of scorn divide, 
 Take not thy thunder from us, 
 But take away our pride.""

 Just a babe in a black abyss, 
 No reason for a place like this, 
 The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain, 
 An easy way for the blind to go, 
 A clever path for the fools who know 
 The secret of the Hanged Man - the smile of his lips. 
 The light of the Blind - you'll see, 
 The venom that tears my spine, 
 The Eyes of the Nile are opening - you'll see. 
 She came to me with a serpent's kiss, 
 As the Eye of the Sun rose on her lips, 
 Moonlight catches silver tears I cry, 
 So we lay in a black embrace, 
 And the Seed is sown in a holy place 
 And I watched, and I waited for the Dawn. 
 The light of the Blind - you'll see, 
 The venom that tears my spine, 
 The Eyes of the Nile are opening - you'll see."

 I'm travellin' on, far and wide 
 But now it seems, I'm just a stranger to myself 
 And all the things I sometimes do, it isn't me but someone else 
 I close my eyes, and think of home 
 Another city goes by, in the night 
 Ain't it funny how it is, you never miss it 'til it's gone away 
 And my heart is lying there and will be 'til my dying day 
 So understand 
 Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years 
 Face up, make your stand 
 And realise you're living in the golden years 
 Too much time on my hands, I got you on my mind 
 Can't ease this pain, so easily 
 When you can't find the words to say, it's hard to make it through another day 
 And it makes me wanna cry, and throw my hands up to the sky 
 So understand 
 Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years 
 Face up, make your stand 
 And realise you're living in the golden years 
 So understand 
 Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years 
 Face up, make your stand 
 And realise you're living in the golden years 
 So understand 
 Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years 
 Face up, make your stand

 Fly so high on wings above, 
 When all you see can only bring you sadness, 
 Like a river we will flow, 
 On towards the sea we go, 
 When all you do can only bring you sadness, 
 Out on the sea of madness. 
 Somewhere I hear a voice that's calling, 
 Out in the dark there burns a dream, 
 You got to hope when you are falling, 
 To find the world that you have seen. 
 Oh - my eyes they see but I can't believe, 
 Oh - my heart is heavy as I turn my back and leave. 
 Like the eagle and the dove, 
 Fly so high on wings above, 
 When all you see can only bring you sadness, 
 Like a river we will flow, 
 On towards the sea we go, 
 When all you do can only bring you sadness, 
 Out on the sea of madness. 
 It's madness, 
 The sun don't shine 
 On the sea of madness, 
 There ain't no wind to fill your sails, 
 Madness, 
 When all you see can only bring you sadness 
 On towards the sea we go..."
56,Iron Maiden,metal,Heaven Can Wait,"Can't understand what is happening to me 
 This isn't real this is only a dream 
 But I never have felt, no I never have felt this way before 
 I'm looking down on my body below 
 I lie asleep in the midst of a dream 
 Is it now could it be the Angel of death has come for me? 
 I can't believe that really my time has come 
 I don't feel ready, there's so much left undone 
 And it's my soul and I'm not gonna let it get away 
 Heaven can wait 
 Heaven can wait 
 Heaven can wait 
 Heaven can wait till another day 
 Heaven can wait 
 Heaven can wait 
 Heaven can wait 
 Heaven can wait till another day 
 I have a lust for the earth below 
 And Hell itself is my only foe 
 'Cause I've no fear of dying, I'll go when I'm good and ready 
 I snatch a glimpse of the light's eternal rays 
 I see a tunnel, I stand amazed 
 At all of the people standing there in front of me 
 Into the paths of rightness I'll be led 
 Is this the place where the living join the dead? 
 I wish I knew this was only just a nightmare 
 Heaven can wait 
 Heaven can wait 
 Heaven can wait 
 Heaven can wait till another day 
 Heaven can wait 
 Heaven can wait 
 Heaven can wait 
 Heaven can wait till another day 
 Take my hand, I'll lead you to the promised land 
 Take my hand, I'll give you immortality 
 Eternal youth, I'll take you to the other side 
 To see the truth the path for you is decided 
 My body tingles, I feel so strange 
 I feel so tired, I feel so drained 
 And I'm wondering if I'll ever be the same again 
 Is this in Limbo or in Heaven or Hell? 
 Maybe I'm going down there as well 
 I can't accept my soul will drift forever 
 Feel myself floating back down to earth 
 So could this be the hour of my rebirth 
 Or have I died or will I wake from dreaming? 
 Heaven can wait 
 Heaven can wait 
 Heaven can wait 
 Heaven can wait till another day 
 Heaven can wait 
 Heaven can wait 
 Heaven can wait 
 Heaven can wait till another day 
 Heaven can wait 
 Heaven can wait

57,Iron Maiden,metal,The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner,"Tough of the track, 
 With the wind, 
 And the rain that's beating down on your back. 
 Your heart's beating loud 
 And goes on getting louder 
 And goes on even more till the sound 
 Is ringing in your head, 
 With every step you tread, 
 And every breath you take, 
 Determination makes 
 You run, 
 Never stop, 
 Gotta win, gotta run till you drop, 
 Keep the pace, 
 Hold the race, 
 Your mind is getting clearer, 
 You're over halfway there but the miles 
 Just never seem to end 
 As if you're in a dream, 
 Not getting anywhere. 
 It seems so futile. 
 Run, on and on, 
 Run, on and on, 
 The loneliness of the long distance runner. 
 I've got to keep running the course, 
 I've got to keep running and win at all costs, 
 I've got to keep going, be strong, 
 Must be so determined and push myself on. 
 Run over stiles, across fields, 
 Turn to look at who's on your heels, 
 Way ahead of the field, 
 The line is getting nearer but do 
 You want the glory that goes, 
 You reach the final stretch, 
 Ideals are just a trace, 
 You feel like throwing the race, 
 It's all so futile. 
 Run, on and on, 
 Run, on and on, 
 The loneliness of the long distance runner. 
 Run, on and on 
 Run, on and on 
 The loneliness of the long distance runner"
58,Iron Maiden,metal,Stranger In A Strange Land,"Was many years ago that I left home and came this way 
 I was a young man, full of hopes and dreams 
 But now it seems to me that all is lost and nothing gained 
 Sometimes things ain't what they seem 
 No brave new world, no brave new world 
 No brave new world, no brave new world 
 Night and day I scan horizon, sea and sky 
 My spirit wanders endlessly 
 Until the day will dawn and friends from home discover why 
 Hear me calling, rescue me 
 Set me free, set me free 
 Lost in this place, and leave no trace 
 Stranger in a strange land 
 Land of ice and snow 
 Trapped into this prison, yea 
 Lost and far from home 
 One hundred years have gone and men again 
 They came that way 
 To find the answer to the mystery 
 They found his body lying where it fell on that day 
 Preserved in time for all to see 
 No brave new world, no brave new world 
 Lost in this place, and leave no trace 
 What became of the man that started 
 All are gone and their souls departed 
 Left me here in this place 
 So all alone 
 Stranger in a strange land 
 Land of ice and snow 
 Trapped inside this prison 
 Lost and far from home 
 What became of the man that started 
 All are gone and their souls departed 
 Left me here in this place 
 So all alone 
 Stranger in a strange land

 Trapped inside this prison

 But you don't remember where they're from 
 Could you be wrong? 
 When you've been particular places 
 That you know you've never been before 
 Can you be sure? 
 'Cause you know this has happened before 
 And you know that this moment in time is for real 
 And you know when you feel déjà vu 
 Feel like I've been here before 
 Feel like I've been here before 
 Feel like I've been here before 
 Feel like I've been here before 
 Ever had a conversation 
 That you realise you've had before 
 Isn't it strange? 
 Have you ever talked to someone 
 And you feel you know what's coming next 
 It feels pre-arranged 
 'Cause you know that you've heard it before 
 And you feel that this moment in time is surreal 
 'Cause you know when you feel déjà vu 
 Feel like I've been here before 
 Feel like I've been here before 
 Feel like I've been here before 
 Feel like I've been here before"
60,Iron Maiden,metal,Alexander The Great,"== 
 My son, ask for thyself another kingdom, 
 For that which I leave is too small for thee. 
 == 
 Near to the east 
 In a part of ancient Greece 
 In an ancient land called Macedonia 
 Was born a son 
 To Philip of Macedon 
 The legend, his name was Alexander 
 At the age of 19 
 He became the Macedon King 
 And he swore to free all of Asia Minor 
 By the Aegean Sea 
 In 334 BC 
 He utterly beat the armies of Persia 
 Alexander the Great 
 His name struck fear into hearts of men 
 Alexander the Great 
 Became a legend 'mongst mortal men 
 King Darius III, 
 Defeated, fled Persia 
 The Scythians fell by the river Jaxartes 
 Then Egypt fell to the Macedon King, as well 
 And he founded the city called Alexandria 
 By the Tigris river, 
 He met King Darius again 
 And crushed him again in the battle of Arbela 
 Entering Babylon 
 And Susa, treasures he found 
 Took Persepolis-the capital of Persia 
 Alexander the Great 
 His name struck fear into hearts of men 
 Alexander the Great 
 Became a god amongst mortal men 
 A Phrygian King had bound a chariot yoke 
 And Alexander cut the Gordian knot 
 And legend said that who untied the knot 
 He would become the master of Asia 
 Hellenism, he spread far and wide 
 The Macedonian learned mind 
 Their culture was a Western way of life 
 He paved the way for Christianity 
 Marching on, marching on 
 The battle-weary, marching side by side 
 Alexander's army line by line 
 They wouldn't follow him to India 
 Tired of the combat, pain, and the glory 
 Alexander the Great 
 His name struck fear into hearts of men 
 Alexander the Great 
 He died of fever in Babylon"

63,Iron Maiden,metal,Sheriff Of Huddersfield,"Life in a city living in L.A. 
 Is a long way from Huddersfield town 
 The back of the Rainbow's a long way from heaven 
 But that's where he get's his pork pie 
 Limos and ladies they're driving him queasy 
 Rugby and cricket's unknown 
 Baseball and football they're making him lazy 
 Your fan club says ""Rodney come home"" 
 The Sheriff of Huddersfield locked in his castle 
 Look down on Hollywood Hills 
 The Sheriff of Huddersfield locked in his castle 
 You're our own Hot Rod on wheels 
 A good game of arrows a few dozen barrels 
 The Nautilus rusts in the yard 
 But for Yorkshire he's yearning but because he's earning 
 He'll always live in L.A. 
 A custom made wallet that stays in his pocket 
 And never comes out to pay bills 
 He's winning at poker and playing the Joker 
 And he always cheats when he deals 
 (Rodney's rap) 
 Hello, let me introduce meself! 
 My name is Rodney. I'm immensely strong. 
 When I were a lad, I could lift up five 
 Navies on an end of a shovel. 
 The reason I never took martial arts because 
 I was immensely fearsome and 
 I'd probably kill everybody 
 I came into contact with it. 
 I was phenomenally strong. 
 Pride and ego, my lads, pride and ego, 
 Is what makes the world rotate. 
 And everybody knows the centre of the universe is Huddersfield 
 But I don't live there anymore. 
 I live in Los Angeles. 
 It's great!... I think 
 Rufus the red has a crane by his bed 
 To wrench himself up in the morn' 
 But if you dare to tread at the foot of his bed 
 You'll wish you'd never been born. 
 A bear with a sore head we mean your forehead 
 He slumbers for most of the day 
 Wide eyed and legless baked beans for breakfast 
 Your problem Rodney L.A."

 The accursed ones I'll find them all

 As a suicide you shall be damned 
 And if you try to save your soul 
 I will torment you, you shall not grow old

 Gemini is rising as the red lips kiss to bite 
 Seven angels seven demons battle for his soul 
 When Gabriel lies sleeping, this child was born to die 
 One more dies one more lives 
 One baby cries, one mother grieves 
 For all the sins you will commit 
 You'll beg forgiveness and none I'll give 
 A web of fear shall be your coat 
 To clothe you in the night 
 A lucky escape for you young man

66,Iron Maiden,metal,Infinite Dreams,"Infinite dreams, I can't deny them 
 Infinity is hard to comprehend 
 I couldn't hear those screams 
 Even in my wildest dreams 
 Suffocation, waking in a sweat 
 Scared to fall asleep again 
 In case the dream begins again 
 Someone chasing, I cannot move 
 Standing rigid, a nightmare's statue 
 What a dream, when will it end? 
 And will I transcend? 
 Restless sleep, the mind's in turmoil 
 One nightmare ends, another fertile 
 It's getting to me, so scared to sleep 
 But scared to wake now, in too deep 
 Even though it's reached new heights 
 I rather like the restless nights 
 It makes me wonder, makes me think 
 There's more to this, I'm on the brink 
 It's not the fear of what's beyond 
 It's just that I might not respond 
 I have an interest, almost craving 
 But would I like to get too far in? 
 It can't be all coincidence 
 Too many things are evident 
 You tell me you're an unbeliever 
 Spiritualist? Well, me, I'm neither 
 But wouldn't you like to know the truth 
 Of what's out there, to have the proof 
 And find out just which side you're on 
 Where would you end? In Heaven or in Hell? 
 Help me 
 Help me to find my true self without seeing the future 
 Save me 
 Save me from torturing myself, even within my dreams 
 There's got to be just more to it than this 
 Or tell me, why do we exist? 
 I'd like to think that when I die 
 I'd get a chance, another time 
 And to return and live again 
 Reincarnate, play the game 
 Again and again and again and again"

 So if you are a dancer, 
 You could dance his pole in May 
 That's a maypole 
 Black Bart's coming 
 Now Black Bart's gone 
 Black Bart did it so I wrote this song 
 Whatever and however, 
 In and out or several at a time mmm yes! 
 We all got to do the Black Bart blues 
 Here comes the guitar solo 
 We all got to try the Black Bart blues 
 Yowsa! Yowsa! Yowsa!"
74,Iron Maiden,metal,Massacre,"At a point below zero 
 There's no place left to go 
 Six hundred unknown heroes 
 Were killed like sleeping buffalo 
 Through the devil's canyon 
 Across the battlefield 
 Death has no companion 
 The spirit is forced to yield 
 There goes the bandolero 
 Through the hole in the wall 
 He's a coward but doesn't care though 
 In fact, he doesn't care at all 
 The general that's commanding 
 He's defending what he fears 
 While the troops they are depending 
 On reinforcements from the rear 
 If God is in the heavens 
 How can this happen here? 
 In His name, they used the weapons 
 For the massacre 
 There is a point below zero 
 Where the sun can see the land 
 Six hundred unknown heroes 
 Lay dead in the sand"
75,Iron Maiden,metal,Tailgunner,"Trace your way back 50 years 
 To the glow of Dresden - blood and tears 
 In the black above by the cruel searchlight 
 Men will die men will fight - Yeah! 
 Who shot who and who fired first? 
 Dripping death to whet the bloodthirst 
 No radar lock on - skin and bone 
 The bomber boys are going home 
 Climb into the sky never wonder why 
 Tailgunner, you're a tailgunner 
 Climb into the sky never wonder why 
 Tailgunner, you're a tailgunner 
 Climb into the sky never wonder why 
 Tailgunner, you're a tailgunner 
 Climb into the sky never wonder why 
 Tailgunner, you're a tailgunner 
 Nail that Fokker kill that son 
 Going to blow your guts out with my gun 
 The weather forecast's good for war 
 Cologne and Frankfurt? Have some more! 
 Tail end Charlie in the boiling sky 
 The Enola Gay was my last try 
 Now that this tailgunner's gone 
 No more bombers, one big bomb 
 Climb into the sky never wonder why 
 Tailgunner, you're a tailgunner 
 Climb into the sky never wonder why 
 Tailgunner, you're a tailgunner 
 Climb into the sky never wonder why

76,Iron Maiden,metal,Holy Smoke,"Believe in me and send no money 
 I died on the cross, that ain't funny 
 But my so called friends they're making me a joke 
 They missed out what I said like I never spoke 
 They choose what they wanna hear, don't tell a lie 
 They just leave out the truth as they're watching you die 
 They're saving the souls by taking your money 
 Flies around shit, bees around honey 
 Holy smoke, holy smoke 
 Plenty bad preachers for the devil to stoke 
 Feed 'em in feet first this is no joke 
 This is thirsty work - making holy smoke 
 Making holy smoke 
 Jimmy Reptile and all his friends 
 Say they gonna be with you at the end 
 Burning records, burning books 
 Holy soldiers, Nazi looks 
 Crocodile smiles, just wait awhile 
 Till the TV Queen gets her make up clean 
 I've lived in filth, I've lived in sin 
 And I still smell cleaner than the shit you're in 
 Holy smoke, holy smoke 
 There's plenty bad preachers for the devil to stoke 
 Feed 'em in feet first, this is no joke 
 This is thirsty work - making holy smoke 
 Holy smoke 
 Smells good 
 They ain't religious but they ain't no fools 
 When Noah built his Cadillac it was cool 
 Two by two they're still going down 
 And the satellite circus just left town 
 I think they're strange and when they're dead 
 They can have a Lincoln for their bed 
 Friend of the president, trick of the tail 
 Now they ain't got a prayer, one hundred years in jail 
 Holy smoke, holy smoke 
 Plenty bad preachers for the devil to stoke 
 Feed 'em in feet first this is no joke 
 This is thirsty work - making holy smoke 
 Holy smoke"
77,Iron Maiden,metal,No Prayer For The Dying,"There are times when I wondered 
 And times when I cried 
 When my prayers they were answered 
 At times when I've lied 
 But if you asked me a question 
 Would I tell you the truth 
 Now there's something to bet on 
 You've got nothing to lose 
 When I've sat by the window 
 And gazed at the rain 
 With an ache in my heart 
 But never feeling the pain 
 If you would tell me 
 Just what my life means 
 Walking in a long road 
 Never reaching the end 
 God give me the answers to my life 
 God give me the answers to my dreams 
 God give me the answers to my prayers 
 God give me the answers to my being"
78,Iron Maiden,metal,Public Enema #One,"When it all comes down the line 
 And the lights they turn to greed 
 And you race off with your tyres screaming 
 Rolling thunder 
 And the people choke with poison 
 Children cry in fear 
 But you've got your fast bullet 
 One way ticket outta here 
 Fall on your knees today 
 And pray the world will mend it's ways 
 Get to your feet again 
 Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain 
 In the cities, in the streets 
 There's a tension you can feel 
 Breaking strain is fast approaching 
 Guns and riots 
 Politicians gamble and lie to save their skins 
 And the Press get fed the scapegoats 
 Public Enema number one 
 Fall on your knees today 
 And pray the world will mend it's ways 
 Get to your feet again 
 Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain 
 A million network slaves 
 In an advertising new age 
 I don't need a crystal ball to sell ya 
 Your children have more brains 
 Than your drug infested remains 
 California dreaming as the Earth dies screaming 
 Fall on your knees today 
 And pray the world will mend it's ways 
 Get to your feet again 
 Refugees from the heartbreak 
 Fall on your knees today 
 And pray the world will mend it's ways 
 Get to your feet again 
 Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain"
79,Iron Maiden,metal,Fates Warning,"Why is it some of us are destined to stay alive 
 And some of us are here just so that we'll die 
 How come the bullet hits the other guy 
 Do we have to try and reason why 
 Be it the devil or be it him 
 You can count on just one thing 
 When the time is up you'll know 
 Not just one power runs the show 
 Are we the lucky ones saved for another day 
 Or they the lucky ones who are taken away 
 Is it a hand on your shoulder from the Lord above 
 Or the Devil himself come to give you a shove 
 Be it the devil or be it him 
 You can count on just one thing 
 When the time is up you'll know 
 Not just one power runs the show 
 A volcano erupts and sweeps a town away 
 A hurricane devastates the cities in its way 
 The grief and misery for the ones that are left behind 
 The worst is yet to come a hell to face mankind"

 And the pattern of your ways

 I hear your telephone talk 
 I want to understand the way you think

 I feel my hands go tight 
 Excitement running through my veins 
 I've got you in my sights 
 I've got you dead to rights 
 The triggers waiting for my finger 
 I feel adrenalin rush 
 It's just the final touch 
 You can kiss your arse goodbye

 The merchantmen lay in their bed 
 The thump of diesels hammers down 
 In the oily sea-the killing ground 
 His knuckles white his eyes alight 
 He slams the hatch on the deadly night 
 A cunning fox in the chickens lair 
 A hound of hell and the devil don't care 
 Running silent, running deep, we are your final prayer 
 Warriors in secret sleep, a merchantman's nightmare 
 A silent death lies waiting, for all of you below 
 Running silent, running deep, sink into your final sleep 
 Chill the hearts of fighting men 
 In open ocean wondering when? 
 The lethal silver fish will fly 
 The boat will shiver-men will die 
 A cast of millions-a part to play 
 Killer? victim? or fool for a day 
 Obeying an order-men have to die 
 Us or them - a well rehearsed lie 
 Running silent, running deep, we are your final prayer 
 Warriors in secret sleep, a merchantman's nightmare 
 A silent death lies waiting, for all of you below 
 Running silent, running deep, sink into your final sleep 
 The lifeboats shattered the hull is torn 
 The tar black smell of burning oil 
 On the way down to Davy Jones 
 Every man for himself - you're on your own 
 The wolf eyes watch the crosswire 
 'Stern tubes ready','aim and fire' 
 They can pin some medal on your chest 
 But in two more weeks - dead like the rest 
 Running silent, running deep, we are your final prayer 
 Warriors in secret sleep, a merchantman's nightmare 
 A silent death lies waiting, for all of you below

 Behind my green door, there's nothing to see 
 Is that a feature, what kind of creature 
 Would hang around waiting for a guy like me? 
 Stone cold sober and sitting in silence 
 Laid back and looking for sympathy 
 I like a girl who knows where she's bound 
 I don't like girls who've been hanging around

 No big deal, no big sin 
 Strung up on love, I got the hooks screwed in

 Strung up on love, I got the hooks screwed in

 You must have got your wires crossed, 'cause she ain't home 
 Knock on wood, you know I like that sound 
 She never could keep her feet on the ground

 Got new ideas for the decor tonight 
 Gonna make this house a preservation zone 
 Gonna set her in concrete, set her up on her own

 Just empty words and humble pie 
 So get down on your knees honey 
 Assume an attitude 
 You just pray that I'll be waiting 
 Cause you know, you know I'm coming soon

 Middle winter cold winds blow 
 From the trees the snowflakes drifting 
 Swirling round like ghosts in the snow 
 Mother Russia poetry majestic 
 Tells the time of a great empire 
 Turning round the old man ponders 
 Reminiscing an age gone by 
 Mother Russia 
 Dance of the czars 
 Hold up your heads 
 Be proud of what you are 
 Now it has come 
 Freedom at last 
 Turning the tides of history 
 And your past

 Dance of the czars 
 Hold up your heads 
 Remember who you are 
 Can you release 
 The anger and the grief 
 Can you be happy 
 Now your people are free"

 Life is a game just made for fun 
 You know I don't love nobody, I don't love no one 
 Yes, I'm a mover, baby 
 Following the footsteps; One fine day 
 When I asked the wise man which was the way 
 He said: ""Follow your heart and look for yourself 
 And come back and tell me what you have learned"" 
 Yes, I'm a mover, baby 
 Went back and told him, I found me a wife 
 Eleven children and a real good life 
 Told him of love and there's a happy home 
 But I need to return to that long winding road

 Gotta move on down

 Snake eyes in heaven - The thief's in your head 
 You've got to watch them - Be quick or be dead

 Your belly will hold you in place

 Don't matter what's wrong as long as you're alright 
 Pull yourself stupid, rob yourself blind

 But she left there wanting 
 More more more 
 But when she was walking on 
 Down the road 
 She heard a sound that made 
 Her heart explode 
 He whispered to her to get on the back 
 ""I'll take you on a ride 
 From here to eternity"" 
 Hell ain't a bad place 
 Hell is from here to eternity 
 Hell ain't a bad place 
 Hell is from here to eternity 
 She must be having one of her 
 Crazy dreams 
 She'd never sat on a piece so mean 
 It made her feel like she's on cloud nine 
 She even thought she heard the 
 Engine sigh 
 But like all dreams that come to an end 
 They took a tumble at the devil's bend 
 The beast and Charlotte they were 
 Two of a kind 
 They'd always take the line...

91,Iron Maiden,metal,Afraid To Shoot Strangers,"Lying awake at night I wipe the sweat from my brow 
 But it's not the fear 'cause I'd rather go now 
 Trying to visualize the horrors that will lay ahead 
 The desert sand mound a burial ground 
 When it comes to the time 
 Are we partners in crime? 
 When it comes to the time 
 We'll be ready to die 
 God let us go now and finish what's to be done 
 Thy Kingdom Come 
 Thy shall be done...on Earth 
 Trying to justify to ourselves the reasons to go 
 Should we live and let live? 
 Forget or forgive 
 But how can we let them go on this way? 
 The reign of terror, corruption must end 
 And we know deep down there's no other way 
 No trust, no reasoning, no more to say 
 Afraid to shoot strangers 
 Afraid to shoot strangers 
 Afraid, afraid to shoot strangers 
 Afraid, afraid to shoot strangers 
 Afraid, afraid to shoot strangers

 In a choking sweat of fear 
 In the heat of the night you can feel so much 
 In the heat of the night I scream 'Don't touch!' 
 I remember a time when we used and abused 
 And we fought all our battles in vain 
 I remember a time we thought that passion was free 
 In the heat of the night body is a flame 
 We live in fever... 
 I hear your secret heartbeat 
 I can hear your silent cries 
 The kids have lost their freedom 
 And nobody cares till somebody famous dies 
 I remember a time when we used and abused 
 And we fought all our battles in vain 
 I remember a time we thought that passion was free 
 In the heat of the night body is a flame 
 Fever ... we live in fever 
 Now we live in a world of insanity 
 Fear is the key to what you want to be 
 You don't get a say the majority gets it's way 
 You're outnumbered by the bastards till the day you die 
 I hear your silent heartbeat 
 I hear your silent cries 
 Oh your just in lies lies and lies 
 The kids have lost their fredom 
 And nobody cares till somebody famous dies... 
 Keep telling lies and lies and lies and lies and lies and lies and lies 
 I remember the time when we used and abused 
 Ah was just lies 
 I remember the time we thought that passion was free 
 Ah was just lies and lies and lies and lies and lies and lies and lies

 I'd walk a hundred miles 
 If I could make it to the end 
 Oh just to see a smile 
 You see it in their faces 
 The sadness in their tears 
 The desperation and the anger 
 Madness and the fear 
 No hope, no life, just pain and fear 
 No food, no love, just greed is here 
 Starvation and the hunger 
 The suffering and the pain 
 The agonies of all-out war 
 When will it come again? 
 The struggle for the power 
 A tyrant tries again 
 Just what the hell is going on? 
 When will it ever end? 
 No hope, no life, just pain and fear 
 No food, no love, just greed is here 
 You see the full moon float 
 You watch the red sunrise 
 We take these things for granted 
 But somewhere someone's dying 
 Contaminated waters 
 Pollution and decay 
 Just waiting for disease to strike 
 Oh will we learn someday? 
 No hope, no life, just pain and fear 
 No food, no love, no seed, childhood's end."

 All of our lives, covered up quickly 
 By the tides of time 
 Spend your days full of emptiness 
 Spend your years full of loneliness 
 Wasting love in a desperate caress 
 Rolling shadows of night 
 Dream on brothers, while you can 
 Dream on sisters, I hope you find the one 
 All of our lives, covered up quickly

 Sands are flowing and the lines 
 Are in your hand 
 In your eyes I see the hunger and the 
 Desperate cry that tears the night

 Spend your years full of loneliness 
 Wasting love in a desperate caress 
 Rolling shadows of night 
 Spend your days full of emptiness

 Rolling shadows of night

95,Iron Maiden,metal,The Fugitive,"On a cold October morning 
 As frost lay on the ground 
 Waiting to make my move 
 I make no sound 
 Waiting for the mist to cover all around 
 I carefully picked my time 
 Then took the wall 
 I'm sick and tired of running 
 The hunger and the pain 
 A stop to look about then off again 
 Being at the wrong place 
 And the wrong time 
 Suspected of a hit that was my crime 
 I am a fugitive being hunted down 
 Like game 
 I am a fugitive but I've got to clear 
 My name 
 Always looking 'round me 
 Forever looking back 
 I'll always be a target for attack 
 Ever moving onwards 
 Always on the run 
 Waiting for the sight of a loaded gun 
 I am a fugitive being hunted down 
 Like game 
 I am a fugitive but I've got to clear 
 My name 
 Even if I find them 
 And get to clear my name 
 I know that things can never 
 Be the same 
 But if I ever prove 
 My innocence some day 
 I've got to get them all to make them pay 
 I am a fugitive being hunted down 
 Like game 
 I am a fugitive but I've got to clear 
 My name"

 He likes to pry into your sunlight 
 He wants to burst into the street with you and I 
 A world of shadows and rain 
 He's seen what love is 
 He wants to pay you back with guilt 
 He lies to you he won't let you be 
 He's got your Chains of Misery 
 He won't be still till he's turned your key 
 He holds your Chains of Misery - Yeah! 
 He's got your Chains of Misery 
 There's a prophet in the gutter in the street 
 He says ""You're damned!"" 
 And you believe him 
 He's got a vision but it shines out through your eyes 
 A world of hatred and fear 
 He smelt what love means 
 He wants to pay you back with pain 
 He lies to you he won't let you be 
 He's got your Chains of Misery 
 He won't be still till he's turned your key 
 He holds your Chains of Misery 
 He lies to you he won't let you be 
 He's got your Chains of Misery 
 He won't be still till he's turned your key 
 He holds your Chains of Misery 
 It's only love that holds the key to your heart 
 It's only love 
 He lies to you he won't let you be 
 He's got your Chains of Misery 
 He won't be still till he's turned your key 
 He holds your Chains of Misery 
 He lies to you he won't let you be

97,Iron Maiden,metal,The Apparition,"I'm here can you see me 
 'Cause I'm out on my own 
 When the room goes cold tell me you can feel me 
 ...'Cause I'm here 
 Here I am, can't you see me 
 Passing through, on my way 
 To a place I'd been to only in my dreams 
 ...Before 
 In a world of delusion 
 Never turn your back on a friend 
 'Cause you can count your real true friends on one hand 
 ...Through life 
 There are those that deceive you 
 There are those that'll let you down 
 Is there someone out there that would die for you 
 ...Thought not 
 Live your life with a passion 
 Everything you do, do well 
 You only get out of life what you put in 
 ...So they say 
 In a world of confusion 
 People never say what they mean 
 If you want a straight answer 
 Go look for one 
 ...Right now 
 In a room full of strangers 
 Do you stand with your back to the wall 
 Do you sometimes feel like you're on the outside 
 ...Looking in? 
 You can make your own luck 
 You create your destiny 
 I believe you have the power if you want to 
 ...It's true 
 You can do what you want to 
 If you try a little bit harder 
 A little bit of faith goes a long way 
 ...It does 
 Are we here for a reason? 
 I'd like to know just what you think 
 It would be nice to know what happens when we die 
 ...Wouldn't it? 
 There are some who are wise 
 There are some who are born naive 
 I believe that there are some that must have lived before 
 ...Don't you? 
 As for me, well I'm thinking 
 You gotta keep an open mind 
 But I hope that my life's not an open and shut case 
 Extrasensory Perception 
 Life after death, telepathy 
 Can the soul live on and travel through space and time? 
 You know I feel so elated 
 'Cause I'm about to find it out 
 And when I know all the answers maybe then I'll come back 
 ...To fill you in 
 You don't be alarmed now 
 If I try to contact you 
 If things go missing or get moved around 
 ...It's me 
 And don't disbelieve it 
 No matter what your friends might say 
 We'll meet up again someplace some way one day"
98,Iron Maiden,metal,Judas Be My Guide,"Lights out, we live in a world of darkness 
 No doubt, everything's up for sale 
 We sleep, all of the world is burning 
 We pray to God for a better deal 
 Nothing is sacred back then or now 
 Everything's wasted 
 Is that all there is? 
 Can I go now? 
 Judas my guide 
 Whispers in the night 
 Judas my guide 
 Fight wars, die in a blaze of glory 
 Come home, meat in a plastic sack 
 Fall down, better pray to your God for mercy 
 So kneel and help the blade cut clean 
 Nothing is sacred back then or now 
 Everyone's wasted 
 Is that all there is? 
 Is that it now? 
 Judas my guide 
 Whispers in the night 
 Judas my guide 
 Judas my guide 
 Whispers in the night 
 Judas my guide 
 I live in the black 
 I have no guiding light 
 I'm whispering in your dreams 
 Judas my guide 
 Whispers in the night 
 Judas my guide 
 Judas my guide 
 Whispers in the night

99,Iron Maiden,metal,Weekend Warrior,"The rebel of yesterday, tomorrow's fool 
 Who are you kidding being that cool? 
 Trying to break away from running with the pack 
 But they ain't listening so you've gotta go back 
 You're a weekend warrior when you're one of the crowd 
 But it's over 
 Just look at you now 
 Look at you now 
 Just look at you now 
 Just look at you now 
 You're not so brave the way you behave 
 It makes you sick, gotta get out quick 
 It's all bravado when you're out with your mates 
 It's like a different person goes through those gates 
 And the game begins, the adrenalin's high 
 Feel the tension 
 Maybe someone will die 
 Someone will die 
 Someone will die 
 Maybe someone will die

 You ain't that way anymore 
 You've gotta get out 
 Gotta get away 
 But you're in with a clique 
 It's not easy to stray 
 You've gotta admit 
 You're just living a lie 
 It didn't take long 
 To work out why 
 It's hard to say why you got involved 
 Just wanting to be part 
 Just wanting to belong 
 To belong 
 To belong 
 To belong

 Some of the things that you've done 
 You feel so ashamed 
 After all it's only a game isn't it? 
 And after all the adrenalin's gone 
 What you gonna do... on Monday? 
 What you gonna do...? 
 What you gonna do... on Monday?

100,Iron Maiden,metal,Fear Of The Dark,"I am a man who walks alone 
 And when I'm walking a dark road 
 At night or strolling through the park 
 And when the light begins to change 
 I sometimes feel a little strange 
 A little anxious when it's dark 
 Fear of the dark, fear of the dark 
 I have a constant fear that something's always near 
 Fear of the dark, fear of the dark 
 I have a phobia that someone's always there 
 Have you run your fingers down the wall 
 And have you felt your neck skin crawl 
 When you're searching for the light? 
 Sometimes when you're scared to take a look 
 At the corner of the room 
 You've sensed that something's watching you 
 Fear of the dark, fear of the dark 
 I have constant fear that something's always near 
 Fear of the dark, fear of the dark 
 I have a phobia that someone's always there 
 Have you ever been alone at night 
 Thought you heard footsteps behind 
 And turned around and no one's there? 
 And as you quicken up your pace 
 You find it hard to look again 
 Because you're sure there's someone there 
 Fear of the dark, fear of the dark 
 I have constant fear that something's always near 
 Fear of the dark, fear of the dark 
 I have a phobia that someone's always there 
 Fear of the dark, fear of the dark 
 Fear of the dark, fear of the dark 
 Fear of the dark, fear of the dark 
 Fear of the dark, fear of the dark 
 Watching horror films the night before 
 Debating witches and folklores 
 The unknown troubles on your mind 
 Maybe your mind is playing tricks 
 You sense, and suddenly eyes fix 
 On dancing shadows from behind 
 Fear of the dark, fear of the dark 
 I have constant fear that something's always near 
 Fear of the dark, fear of the dark 
 I have a phobia that someone's always there 
 Fear of the dark, fear of the dark 
 I have constant fear that something's always near 
 Fear of the dark, fear of the dark 
 I have a phobia that someone's always there 
 When I'm walking a dark road 
 I am a man who walks alone"

 Open a pair of eyes 
 I can't see my feelings 
 Keep them behind 
 I just keep on reeling 
 Running back down the line 
 Oh, I can't stand that screaming 
 Don't even try 
 Music fans some feelings 
 It'll be tell me why 
 I can't stop that feeling 
 Showing me why 
 Man I love that feeling 
 Yeah, blowin' me right through the sky 
 Oh hey hey hey hey hey hey 
 Oh, listen to what she says

 Dunno... someone must have pissed in it.

 Say well, fucking big piss... somebody did.

 Trying to feed it through the ground, it's like a well. About three feet deep So I... that's right, fucking John shit himself. There was soil, it's like quicksand... he went down there to spread the fucking soil, and he's sinking in, isn't he. He suddenly reached for the fucking fork lift and I lifted up he couldn't reach it... he was shitting himself. He was just going by the at the end of the boots. He said ""I'm fucking going, I'm going! Just lower the fucking forklift quick!"" And he grabbed hold of it, so I had to lift it up with him hanging on the end of it. Good job he didn't let go otherwise right in the fucking mud!

 Roll over Vic Vella, give me more bales of hay 
 Roll over Vic Vella, Roll over Vic Vella

 Roll over Vic Vella, don't you mow that lawn my way 
 Early in the morning I'm giving you a warning 
 Don't you step on my tractor blades 
 Hey devil he's on the fiddle 
 And he ain't got nothing to lose 
 Roll over Vic Vella, tell the tax man the bad news

105,Iron Maiden,metal,Sign Of The Cross,"Eleven saintly shrouded men 
 Silhouettes stand against the sky 
 One in front with a cross held high 
 Come to wash my sins away 
 Standing alone in the wind and rain 
 Feeling the fear that is growing 
 Sensing the change in the tide again 
 Brought by the storm that is brewing 
 Feel the anxiety hold off the fear 
 Some of the doubts in the things you believe 
 Now that your faith will be put to the test 
 Nothing to do but await what is coming 
 Why then is God still protecting me 
 Even when I don't deserve it 
 Though I am blessed with an inner strength 
 Some they would call it a penance 
 Why am I meant to face this alone 
 Asking the question time and again 
 Praying to God won't keep me alive 
 Inside my head feel the fear start to rise... 
 They'll be saying their prayers when the moment comes 
 There'll be penance to pay when it's Judgement Day 
 And the guilty'll bleed when that moment comes 
 They'll be coming to claim, take your soul away 
 The sign of the cross 
 The name of the rose 
 A fire in the sky 
 The sign of the cross 
 They'll be coming to bring the eternal flame 
 They'll be bringing us all immortality 
 Holding communion so the world be blessed 
 My creator, my God'll lay my soul to rest 
 The sign of the cross 
 The name of the rose 
 A fire in the sky 
 The sign of the cross 
 The sign of the cross 
 The name of the rose 
 A fire in the sky 
 The sign of the cross 
 The name of the rose 
 The sign of the cross 
 Lost the love of heaven above 
 Chose the lust of the earth below 
 Eleven saintly shrouded men 
 Came to wash my sins away"
106,Iron Maiden,metal,Lord Of The Flies,"I don't care for this world anymore 
 I just want to live my own fantasy 
 Fate has brought us to these shores 
 What was meant to be is now happening 
 I've found that I like this living in danger 
 Living on the edge it feels, it makes us feel as one 
 Who cares now what's right or wrong, it's reality 
 Killing so we survive wherever we may roam 
 Wherever we may hide, we've got to get away 
 I don't want existence to end 
 We must prepare ourselves for the elements 
 I just want to feel like we're strong 
 We don't need a code of morality 
 I like all the mixed emotion and anger 
 It brings out the animal, the power you can feel 
 And feeling so high with this much adrenaline 
 Excited but scary to believe what we've become 
 Saints and sinners 
 Something within us 
 We are lord of the flies 
 Saints and sinners 
 Something willing us 
 To be lord of the flies 
 Saints and sinners 
 Something within us 
 We are lord of the flies 
 Saints and sinners 
 Something willing us 
 To be lord of the flies 
 Saints and sinners 
 Something within us 
 We are lord of the flies 
 Saints and sinners 
 Something willing us 
 To be lord of the flies"
107,Iron Maiden,metal,Man On The Edge,"The freeway is jammed and it's backed up for miles 
 The car is an oven and baking is wild 
 Nothing is ever the way it should be 
 What we deserve we just don't get, you see 
 A briefcase, a lunch and a man on the edge 
 Each step gets closer to losing his head 
 Is someone in heaven? Are they looking down? 
 Nothing is fair, just you look around 
 Falling down 
 Falling down 
 Falling down 
 Falling down 
 Falling down 
 Falling down 
 He's sick of waiting, of lying like this 
 There's a hole in the sky for the angels to kiss 
 Branded a leper because you don't fit 
 In the land of the free you just live by your wits 
 Once he built missiles, a nation's defence 
 Now he can't even give birthday presents 
 Across the city he leaves in his wake 
 A glimpse of the future a cannibal state 
 Falling down 
 Falling down 
 Falling down 
 Falling down 
 Falling down 
 Falling down 
 The freeway is jammed and it's backed up for miles 
 The car is an oven and baking is wild 
 Nothing is ever the way it should be

108,Iron Maiden,metal,Fortunes Of War,"After the war 
 And now that they've sent us homeward 
 I can't help but feel that I'm on my own 
 No one can see just what this conflict has done to 
 The minds of the men who are on their way home 
 I'm scarred for life 
 But it's not my flesh that's wounded 
 So how can I face the torment alone 
 The vivid scenes and all the recurring nightmares 
 I lay there and sweat until it gets light 
 People say 'don't worry' 
 Say that time's a perfect healer 
 That the nightmares they will come to pass 
 Can't hear what they're saying 
 I am living in my own world 
 And I'm feeling trance-like all the time 
 I hear voices in my head 
 Could I really be going crazy 
 In the night the visions seem so real 
 Do you care if you live or die 
 When you laugh are you really crying 
 You're not sure what's real anymore 
 Fortunes of war 
 Fortunes of war 
 Fortunes of war 
 No pain anymore 
 Sometimes I wake 
 I feel that my spirit's broken 
 I wonder if I've the strength... 
 Carry on carry on"
109,Iron Maiden,metal,Look For The Truth,"All my dark dreams drift like smoke in the breeze 
 The fear grips me as I fall toward my sleep 
 Here comes the nightmare that never ends 
 Here is the dream that makes monsters of men 
 In the house of my soul 
 In rooms of ugliness and cold 
 Memories locked away 
 All the doubts and fears I never faced 
 Now they come again 
 I am falling down to meet with them 
 Fears within us all 
 Mine awake and they stand up tall 
 Look for the truth 
 Deepest cut of all from you 
 Knife of the truth 
 Blade of hatred slicing through 
 I pray my sleep will break 
 Maybe this time I won't wake 
 Weakness I hide so well 
 This dagger in my mind will tell 
 It's my final stand 
 I make a fist out of each hand 
 To shadows of the past 
 Take a breath and I scream attack 
 Look for the truth 
 Deepest cut of all from you 
 Knife of the truth 
 Blade of hatred slicing through 
 Here is the truth 
 Deepest cut of all from you 
 Knife of the truth 
 Blade of hatred slicing through"
110,Iron Maiden,metal,The Aftermath,"Silently to silence fall 
 In the fields of futile war 
 Toys of death are spitting lead 
 Where boys that were our soldiers bled 
 War horse and war machine 
 Curse the name of liberty 
 Marching on as if they should 
 Mix in the dirt our brother's blood 
 In the mud and rain 
 What are we fighting for 
 Is it worth the pain 
 Is it worth dying for 
 Who will take the blame 
 Why did they make a war 
 Questions that come again 
 Should we be fighting at all 
 Once a ploughman hitched his team 
 Here he sowed his little dream 
 Bodies, arms and legs are strewn 
 Where mustard gas and barbwire bloom 
 Each moment's like a year 
 I've nothing left inside for tears 
 Comrades dead or dying lie 
 I'm left alone asking why 
 In the mud and rain 
 What are we fighting for 
 Is it worth the pain 
 Is it worth dying for 
 Who will take the blame 
 Why did they make a war 
 Questions that come again 
 Should we be fighting at all 
 After the war 
 Left feeling no one has won 
 After the war 
 What does a soldier become 
 After the war 
 Left feeling no one has won 
 After the war 
 What does a soldier become 
 What is at home when the battles are done? 
 After the war and when no one has won 
 I'm just a soldier 
 After the war 
 Left feeling no one has won 
 After the war 
 What does a soldier become 
 After the war 
 Left feeling no one has won 
 After the war 
 What does a soldier become"
111,Iron Maiden,metal,Judgement Of Heaven,"A lonely cry for help reaching out for help 
 To anyone 
 A silent prayer to God to help you on your way 
 I've been depressed so long 
 It's hard to remember when I was happy 
 I've felt like suicide a dozen times or more 
 But that's the easy way, that's the selfish way 
 The hardest part is to get on with your life 
 You're searching in the dark 
 Clutching at straws to find a way 
 You take the Tarot cards 
 And throw them to the wind 
 Your question your beliefs, your inner thoughts, 
 Your whole existence 
 And if there is a God then answer if you will 
 And tell me of my fate, tell me of my place 
 Tell me if I'll ever rest in peace 
 If you could live your life again 
 Would you change a thing 
 Or leave it all the same 
 If you had the chance again 
 Would you change a thing at all 
 When you look back at your past 
 Can you say that you are proud 
 Of what you've done 
 Are there times when you believe 
 That the right you thought was wrong 
 All of my life I have believed 
 Judgement of Heaven is waiting for me 
 All of my life now I have believed 
 Judgement of Heaven awaits for me 
 All of my life I have believed 
 Judgement of Heaven is waiting for me 
 Is waiting for me ..."
112,Iron Maiden,metal,Blood On The World's Hands,"Sometimes it makes me wonder 
 Sometimes it makes me question 
 Sometimes it makes me sadden 
 Always, it makes me angry, but... 
 When you can see it happening- 
 The madness that's all around you 
 Nobody seems to worry 
 The world seems so powerless to act... 
 It's out of control 
 Blood on the world's hands 
 Each day, a new toll 
 Another assassination 
 The same day, a new creation 
 But what are they coming into- 
 Security of a world that brings... 
 One day, another killing 
 Somewhere, there's someone starving 
 Another, a savage raping 
 Meanwhile, there's someone laughing at us 
 It's out of control 
 Blood on the world's hands 
 Each day, it goes on 
 Blood on the world's hands 
 Brutality and aggression 
 Tomorrow, another lesson 
 Expecting another air raid 
 Praying for a ceasefire 
 They say things are getting better 
 No need to be complacent 
 There's chaos across the border 
 And one day, it could be happening to us 
 It's out of control 
 Blood on the world's hands 
 It's our epitaph 
 It's out of control 
 Someone should know 
 Blood on the world's hands 
 Someone should-"
113,Iron Maiden,metal,The Edge Of Darkness,"I've looked into the heart of darkness 
 Where the blood-red journey ends 
 When you've faced the heart of darkness 
 Even your soul begins to bend 
 For a week I have been waiting 
 Still I am only in Saigon 
 The walls move in a little closer 
 I feel the jungle call me on 
 Every minute I get weaker 
 While in the jungle they grow strong 
 What I wanted was a mission 
 And for my sins they gave me one 
 They brought it up just like room service 
 'Cause everyone gets what they want 
 And when that mission was all over 
 I'd never want another one 
 I know, captain, 
 That you've done this work before 
 We've got a problem 
 You can help us all I'm sure 
 The colonel's gone rogue 
 And his methods are unsound 
 You'll take a PBR up river track him down 
 There's a conflict in every human heart 
 And the temptation is to take it all to far 
 In this war things get so confused 
 But there are some things 
 Which cannot be excused 
 He's acting like a God - an insane lunatic 
 Your mission - exterminate 
 With extreme prejudice 
 The route is dangerous 
 And your progress may be slow 
 Here is the file and it's all you need to know 
 Here I am the knife in my hand 
 And now I understand why the genius must die 
 Now I stand alone in the darkness 
 With his blood upon my hands 
 Where sat the warrior the poet 
 Now lie the fragments of a man 
 I've looked into the heart of darkness 
 Where the blood-red journey ends 
 When you've faced the heart of darkness 
 Even your soul begins to bend"
114,Iron Maiden,metal,2 A.M.,"I get in from work at 2:00 A.M. and sit down with a beer 
 Turn on late-night TV and then wonder why I'm here 
 It's meaningless and trivial and it washes over me 
 And once again I wonder, is this all there is for me? 
 Here I am again 
 Look at me again 
 Here I am again 
 On my on 
 Trying hard to see 
 What there is for me 
 Here I am again 
 On my own 
 Life seems so pathetic, I wish I could leave it all behind 
 This canvas chair, this bed, these walls that fall in on my mind 
 Hold on for something better that just drags you through the dirt 
 Do you just let go or carry on and try to take the hurt? 
 Here I am again 
 Look at me again 
 Here I am again 
 On my own 
 Trying hard to see 
 What there is for me 
 Here I am again 
 On my own 
 Here I am again 
 Look at me again 
 Here I am again

 Trying hard to see 
 What there is for me 
 Here I am again 
 On my own 
 Here I am again 
 Look at me again

 Alone again 
 I'm here on my own"

 Do you feel at ease with what you see

 Is there something that you'd rather be 
 Never thought you'd be, had the chance to see 
 All my life I've run away 
 All my life I've tried to hide away 
 Feel the paranoia creeping in 
 Like a cancer eating at the skin 
 Do you feel you've lost your self-esteem 
 And your self respect, what can you expect 
 All my life I've run away 
 All my life I've tried to hide away 
 All my life... I've run away 
 Let my faith... slip away 
 All my life... I've run away 
 Allowed my faith... to drift away 
 Are you scared to look inside your mind 
 Are you worried just at what you'll find 
 Do you really want to face the truth 
 Does it matter now, what have you got to lose 
 Try to release the anger from within 
 Forgive yourself a few immortal sins 
 Do you really care what people think 
 Are you strong enough to release the guilt 
 All my life I've run away 
 All my life I've tried to hide away 
 All my life... I've run away 
 Let my faith... slip away 
 All my life... I've run away 
 Allowed my faith... to drift away"
116,Iron Maiden,metal,Justice Of The Peace,"(Murray/Harris) 
 Have you heard on the news 
 Another let off madman 
 Another screw on the loose 
 Is it the judge or the badman 
 What's the matter these days 
 No one has the courage to put them away 
 Nobody has any faith 
 'Cause there's a breakdown of justice and order 
 *Watiting for justice, waiting for justice of the peace 
 Waiting for justice, waiting for justice of the peace 
 When I remember back the memories of yesteryear (they really say 'yesterday') 
 With all the friends and all the times 
 When people were carefree 
 And walking down the street 
 When everyone knew everyone 
 And all the houses doors were open 
 No had to care those days are gone 
 Those days are gone 
 *Repeat 
 I long for the times when you could 
 Wander down the street unharmed 
 When poeple didn't have much money 
 But didn't seem to care 
 It must be the cynic in me 
 But I don't really like things now 
 The violence, the attitudes 
 Aggression that you see everyday 
 A sick society looks the other way."
117,Iron Maiden,metal,I Live My Way,"(Harris, Bayley, Gers) 
 Sometimes when I feel the anger 
 Sometimes when I'm all alone 
 Sometimes when I feel surrounded 
 Like all the doors are closed 
 I feel like I've been a prisoner 
 I feel like I've been a tool 
 Let people try to judge me 
 When they're not in my shoes 
 *I've lived on my knees 
 Trying to please 
 It's time to change 
 Some people are only happy 
 When they can watch you fail 
 And to them every day is 
 Another coffin nail 
 I think that I've found the answer 
 I think that at last I know 
 We've only got one lifetime 
 I'll make my life my own 
 *Repeat 
 To live my own way 
 I live my way 
 Living for today 
 Don't care what they say"
118,Iron Maiden,metal,Judgement Day,"(Bayley, Gers) 
 There are no marks upon a man 
 That can say he's good or bad 
 No label and no tell tale sign 
 That can show he's full of lies 
 *By your deeds you will be known 
 Time will tell truth will show 
 As we exhale every breath 
 We all got closer to our death 
 **What will you say 
 What will you say 
 On judgement day 
 On judgement day 
 When you look into their eyes 
 You don't know what they hide 
 No label and no tell tale sign 
 That can show he's full of lies 
 *Repeat 
 **Repeat 
 Ignorance is bliss is that the reason 
 We can not read another's mind 
 If we knew what thoughts were dancing 
 Through each others heads 
 Would we all be driven mad 
 Would we all be dead 
 *Repeat 
 **Repeat"
119,Iron Maiden,metal,Virus,"There's an evil virus that's threatening mankind 
 Not state of the art; a serious state of the mind 
 The muggers, the backstabbers, the two-faced elite 
 A menace to society, a social disease 
 Rape of the mind is a social disorder 
 The cynics, the apathy one-upmanship order 
 Watching beginnings of social decay 
 Gloating or sneering at life's disarray 
 Eating away at your own self-esteem 
 Pouncing on every word that you might be saying 
 Rape of the mind is a social disorder 
 The cynics, the apathy one-upmanship order 
 Superficially smiling; a shake of the hand 
 As soon as the back is turned treachery is planned 
 Rape of the mind is a social disorder 
 The cynics, the apathy one-upmanship order 
 Watching beginnings of social decay 
 Gloating or sneering... at life's disarray 
 When every good thing's laid to waste 
 By all the jealousy and hate 
 By all the acid wit and rapier lies 
 And every time you think you're safe 
 And when you go to turn away 
 You know they're sharpening all their paper knives 
 All in your mind 
 All in your head 
 Try to relate it 
 All in your mind 
 All in your head 
 Try to escape it 
 Without a conscience, they destroy 
 And that's a thing that they enjoy 
 They're a sickness that's in all our minds 
 They want to sink the ship and leave 
 The way they laugh at you and me 
 You know it happens all the time 
 All in your mind 
 All in your head 
 Try to relate it 
 All in your mind 
 All in your head 
 Try to escape it

 And now it's getting so I can't sleep at night 
 In the day, feel like death. 
 I'm getting in far too deep, I feel them closing in 
 I've got to say that I'm scared, I know they'll win 
 Even so, I'm prepared. 
 Do you believe what you hear 
 Can you believe what you see 
 Do you believe what you feel 
 Can you believe? 
 What is real? 
 Futureal 
 What is real? 
 Whenever anyone seems to treat me like a freak 
 It makes me see I'm the only one who feels 
 That I know what is real 
 Sometimes it feels like a game of deadly hide and seek 
 And when you're reading this, then I will be gone 
 Maybe then, you will see.

 Take a spin of the wheel 
 Out of your hands now 
 So how do you feel 
 But you're not gonna win 
 You'd better go back again 
 Do you feel lucky 
 Or do you feel scared 
 Take what luck brings 
 And the Devil may care 
 But you're down on your luck 
 And what will the next day bring 
 Adrift on the ocean 
 Afloat in a daydream 
 Or lost in a maze 
 Or blind in the haze 
 So what does it matter 
 So why don't you answer 
 So why did you send 
 An angel to mend 
 Best make decisions 
 Before it's too late 
 Take all your chances 
 Take hold of the reigns 
 A roll of the dice 
 Ahead of the game again 
 Nothing to lose 
 But so much to gain 
 A little danger 
 It goes without saying 
 But what do you care 
 You're gonna go in the end 
 Gate open to Heaven 
 Is ready and waiting 
 Or straight down to hell

122,Iron Maiden,metal,Lightning Strikes Twice,"I feel a breeze on my face in expectance 
 Not very long before the storm reaches here 
 Off in the distance a lightning is flashing again 
 Feel something strong as the power draws near 
 Is it the rolling of thunder that scares you? 
 Is it the crashing of clouds that hold fear? 
 But all I know as I sit in a corner alone 
 It takes me back to my childhood again 
 And as I wait and I look for an answer 
 To all the things going round in my head 
 I ask myself, ""Could it be a disaster and when?"" 
 It's maybe threatening to happen again 
 As the ominous light draws near 
 There's a lone dog howls in the park 
 All the people hurry inside 
 As a lightning flash lights dark 
 The storm is nearly here 
 Only God will know 
 You're sitting alone, you watch 
 As the wind is blowing treetops 
 And the swaying rustling of leaves 
 Plenty of time to perceive 
 As you wait for rain to fall 
 Only God knows 
 The whole sky glows 
 Maybe lightning strikes twice 
 Maybe lightning strikes twice 
 Maybe lightning strikes twice 
 Maybe lightning strikes twice 
 Maybe lightning strikes twice 
 Maybe lightning strikes twice 
 Maybe lightning strikes twice 
 Maybe lightning strikes twice 
 Only God knows 
 The whole sky glows 
 Maybe lightning strikes twice 
 Maybe lightning strikes twice 
 Maybe lightning strikes twice 
 Maybe lightning strikes twice 
 Maybe lightning strikes twice

123,Iron Maiden,metal,The Clansman,"Walk alone in the hills 
 With the wind in your face 
 It feels good to be proud 
 And be free and a race

 And to live on highlands 
 And the air that you breathe 
 So pure and so clean 
 When alone on the hills 
 With the wind in your hair 
 With a longing to feel 
 Just to be free 
 Is it right to believe 
 In the need to be free 
 It's a time when you die 
 And without asking why 
 Can't you see what they do 
 They are grinding us down 
 They are taking our land 
 That belongs to the clans 
 Not alone with a dream 
 Just want to be free 
 With a need to belong

 Freedom! 
 Freedom! 
 Freedom! 
 It's a time wrought with fear 
 It's a land wrought with change

 What is happening now 
 They would turn in their graves 
 They would all be ashamed 
 That the land of the free 
 Has been written in chains 
 And I know what I want 
 When the timing is right 
 Then I'll take what is mine 
 I am the clansman 
 And I swear to defend 
 And we'll fight to the end 
 And I swear that I'll never be taken alive 
 And I know that we'll stand 
 And we'll fight for our land 
 And I swear that my bairns 
 Will be born free 
 And I know what I want 
 When the timing is right 
 Then I'll take what I want 
 I am the clansman

 No, no we can't let them take anymore

 For the hundredth time I check the declination 
 Now the fear starts to grow 
 Even my computer shows 
 There are no errors in the calculations

 Collision course, you must believe it's true 
 Now there's nothing left that we can do 
 When two worlds collide 
 The anger and the pain 
 Of all those who remain 
 Two worlds collide 
 Who will be left alive 
 No place to hide

 So I don't know what it is I'm supposed to do 
 About this awkward situation 
 That's been forced down right upon me 
 As I'm walking down into 
 On my own into the valley of life 
 Got a lifetime of experience 
 Yeah I've got so much to give 
 Open the page at chapter one 
 Could this just be that life's just begun 
 Forever within your darker thoughts 
 Reflecting on everything you've been taught 
 Never felt this way before 
 Seems that somebody's just opened the door 
 To the book of life... or is it death? 
 Is there ever any way out 
 Someone's looking down on me 
 To the very inner core of my soul 
 They won't tell me what they see 
 But I really want to know 
 I want to live my life on my own 
 I want to lift the unturned stone 
 I want to walk right into the fire 
 I want to live out all my desires 
 I want to go and see the fire burn 
 I want to see and feel my world turn 
 I want to know what more there's to learn 
 I want to pass the point of no return 
 Do you really wanna be 
 Just another one statistic or feel 
 That you really should aspire 
 That you really do deserve more 
 Do you ever really fell 
 That you have so much potential inside 
 What you really have to give 
 Could be realized so much more 
 I want to live my life on my own 
 I want to lift the unturned stone 
 I want to walk right into the fire 
 I want to live out all my desires 
 I want to go and see the fire burn 
 I want to see and feel my world turn 
 I want to know what more there's to learn 
 I want to pass the point of no return

 And I will follow 
 Time will go 
 But I will follow 
 Time will flow 
 And I will follow 
 Time will go 
 But I will follow

 I want to meet my father beyond 
 I want to walk right into the light 
 I want to feel no fear but delight 
 I want to live my life on my own 
 I want to lift the unturned stone 
 I want to walk right into the fire 
 I want to live out all my desires 
 Time will flow 
 And I will follow 
 Time will go

 Should we try to remember 
 What is wrong and what is right 
 No more tears, no more tears 
 If we live for a hundred years 
 Amigos no more tears 
 If we do forget them and 
 The sacrifice they made 
 Will the wickedness and sadness 
 Come to visit us again 
 Shall we dance a dance in sunlight 
 Shall we drink a wine of peace 
 Shall our tears be of joy 
 Shall we keep at bay the beast 
 No more tears, no more tears 
 If we live for a hundred years

 On the bow I stand, west is where I go 
 Through the night I plough still my heart calculate and pray 
 As the compass swings my will is strong 
 I will not be led astray 
 Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun 
 But I know, I know 
 I see the ghosts of navigators but they're lost 
 As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost 
 As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea 
 The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me 
 Take my heart and set it free 
 Carried forward by the waves 
 Nowhere left to run, Navigator's son 
 Chasing rainbows all my days 
 Where I go I do not know 
 I only know the place I've been 
 Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so 
 Nothing's real until you feel 
 I steer between the crashing rocks, the sirens call my name 
 Lash my hands onto the helm, blood surging with the strain 
 I will not fail now as sunrise comes the darkness left behind 
 For eternity I follow on there is no other way 
 Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun 
 But I know, I know 
 I see the ghosts of navigators but they're lost 
 As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost 
 As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea 
 The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me 
 Take my heart and set it free 
 Carried forward by the waves 
 Nowhere left to run, Navigator's son 
 Chasing rainbows all my days

131,Iron Maiden,metal,Blood Brothers,"And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life 
 What do you think you'd expect you would see? 
 Just like a mirror reflecting the moves of your life 
 And in the river reflections of me 
 Just for a second, a glimpse of my father I see 
 And in a movement, he beckons to me 
 And in a moment, the memories are all that remain 
 And all the wounds are reopening again 
 We're blood brothers 
 We're blood brothers 
 We're blood brothers 
 We're blood brothers 
 And as you look all around at the world in dismay 
 What do you see, do you think we have learned 
 Not if you're taking a look at the war-torn affray 
 Out in the streets where the babies are burned 
 We're blood brothers 
 We're blood brothers 
 We're blood brothers 
 We're blood brothers 
 There are times when I feel I'm afraid for the world 
 There are times I'm ashamed of us all 
 When you're floating on all the emotion you feel 
 And reflecting the good and the bad 
 Will we ever know what the answer to life really is? 
 Can you really tell me what life is? 
 Maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you 
 Could be swept away by fate's own hand 
 We're blood brothers 
 We're blood brothers 
 We're blood brothers 
 We're blood brothers 
 When you think that we've used all our chances 
 And the chance to make everything right 
 Keep on making the same old mistakes 
 Makes untipping the balance so easy 
 When we're living our lives on the edge 
 Say a prayer on the book of the dead 
 We're blood brothers 
 We're blood brothers 
 We're blood brothers 
 We're blood brothers 
 We're blood brothers 
 We're blood brothers 
 We're blood brothers 
 We're blood brothers 
 And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life"

 But you don't know how? 
 A reflected dream of a captured time 
 Is it really now is it really happening? 
 Don't know why I feel this way have I dreamt this time this place? 
 Something vivid comes again into my mind 
 And I think I've seen your face seen this room been in this place 
 Something vivid comes again into my mind 
 All my hopes and expectations looking for an explanation 
 Have I found my destination? I just can't take no more 
 The dream is true the dream is true 
 The dream is true the dream is true 
 Think I've heard your voice before think I've said these words before 
 Something makes me feel I just might lose my mind 
 Am I still inside my dream? Is this a new reality 
 Something makes me feel that I have lost my mind 
 All my hopes and expectations looking for an explanation 
 Coming to the realization that I can't take no more 
 I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause I'm alive 
 I only dream in black and white to save me from myself 
 I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause I'm alive 
 I only dream in black and white please save me from myself 
 The dream is true the dream is true 
 The dream is true the dream is true 
 I get up put on the light dreading the on coming night 
 Scared to fall asleep and dream the dream again 
 Nothing that I contemplate nothing that I can compare 
 To letting loose the demons deep inside my head 
 Dread to think what might be stirring that my dream is reoccurring 
 Got to keep away myself from drifting saving me from myself 
 I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause I'm alive 
 I only dream in black and white to save me from myself 
 I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause I'm alive 
 I only dream in black and white please save me from myself 
 Lost in a dream of mirrors lost in a paradox 
 Lost and time is spinning lost a nightmare I retrace 
 Lost a hell that I revisit lost another time and place 
 Lost a parallel existence lost a nightmare I retrace 
 I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause I'm alive 
 I only dream in black and white to save me from myself 
 I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause I'm alive 
 I only dream in black and white please save me from myself 
 Oh ooh ooh oh 
 Oh ooh ooh oh 
 Oh ooh ooh oh 
 I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause I'm alive 
 I only dream in black and white to save me from myself 
 I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause I'm alive 
 I only dream in black and white to save me from myself

137,Iron Maiden,metal,The Thin Line Between Love And Hate,"When a person turns to wrong 
 Is it a want to be, belong? 
 Part of things at any cost 
 At what price a life is lost 
 At what point do we begin 
 Fighter spirit a will to win 
 But what makes a man decide 
 Take the wrong or righteous road 
 There's a thin line between love and hate 
 Wider divide that you can see between good and bad 
 There's a gray place between black and white 
 But everyone does have the right to choose the path that he takes 
 We all like to put the blame 
 On society these days 
 But what kind of good or bad 
 A new generation brings 
 Sometimes take just more than that 
 To survive be good at heart 
 There is evil in some of us 
 No matter what will never change 
 I will hope, my soul will fly 
 So I will live forever 
 Heart will die, my soul will fly 
 And I will live forever 
 Just a few small tears between 
 Someone happy and one sad 
 Just a thin line drawn between 
 Being a genius or insane 
 At what age begin to learn 
 Of which way out we will turn 
 There's a long and winding road 
 And the trail is there to burn 
 There's a thin line between love and hate 
 Wider divide that you can see between good and bad 
 There's a gray place between black and white 
 But everyone does have the right to choose the path that he takes 
 I will hope, my soul will fly 
 So I will live forever 
 Heart will die, my soul will fly 
 And I will live forever 
 I will hope, my soul will fly 
 So I will live forever 
 Heart will die, my soul will fly 
 And I will live forever

 But many came, too much for cree,

 Ridin' through dustclouds and barren wastes, 
 Galloping hard on the plains. 
 Chasin' the redskins back to their holes, 
 Fighting them at their own game. 
 Murder for freedom, a stab in the back, 
 Women and children and cowards attack! 
 Let me hear you! 
 Run to the hills! Run for your lives! 
 Run to the hills! Run for your lives! 
 Soldier Blue in the barren wastes, 
 Hunting and killing for game. 
 Raping the women, wasting them men, 
 The only good indians are tame. 
 Selling them whiskey, taking their gold, 
 Enslaving the young and destroying the old!

 In what shape or form that I might be, just another chance for me 
 A hurried time no disgrace, instead of racing to conclusion 
 And wishing all my life away. No-one can stop me now. 
 Time is up it couldn't last, but there's more things I'd like to do 
 I'm coming back to try again. Someday maybe I'll wait till then 
 No more lies, no more lies

 They're time is up just like me, but they just don't know it yet 
 So just a word of warning, when you're in your deepest dreams 
 There's nothing you can hide from. I've got my eye on you 
 The clock is fast the hour is near. Eventful past is everclear 
 My life is set the time is here. I think I'm coming home 
 No more lies, no more lies 
 No more lies, no more lies 
 No more lies, no more lies 
 No more lies, no more lies 
 A hurried time no disgrace, instead of racing to conclusion 
 And wishing all your life away, no one can stop me now

 I'm coming back to try again. Don't tell me that this is the end

 Still burning heretics under our skies 
 Religion's still burning inside 
 At the gates and the walls of Montségur 
 Blood on the stones of the citadel

 Curse of the grail and the blood of the cross 
 Templar believers with blood on their hands 
 Joined in the chorus to kill on command 
 Burned at the stake for their soul's liberty 
 To stand with the cathars to die and be free 
 The book of old testament crippled and black 
 Satan his weapon is lust 
 Living this evil damnation of flesh 
 Back to the torture of life 
 The perfect would willingly die at the stake 
 And all of their followers slain

 Burned at the stake for their soul's liberty 
 Still burning heretics under our skies 
 As we kill them all so god know his own 
 Laugh at the darkness and in god we trust 
 The eye of the triangle smiling with sin 
 No passover feast for the cursed within 
 Facing the sun as they went to their grave 
 Burn like a dog or you live like a slave 
 Death is the price for your soul's liberty 
 To stand with the cathars and to die and be free 
 At the gates and the walls of Montségur 
 Blood on the stones of the citadel 
 At the gates and the walls of Montségur

146,Iron Maiden,metal,Dance Of Death,"Let me tell you a story to chill the bones 
 Out of things that I saw 
 One night wandering in the everglades 
 I'd one drink but no more 
 I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight 
 Gazing up at the stars 
 Not aware of a presence so near to me 
 Watching my every move 
 Feeling scared and I fell to my knees 
 As something rushed me from the trees 
 Took me to an unholy place 
 And that is where I fell from grace 
 Then they summoned me over to join in with them 
 To the dance of the dead 
 Into the circle of fire I followed them 
 Into the middle I was led 
 As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear 
 But still I wanted to go 
 And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me 
 As I walked onto the coals 
 And I felt I was in a trance 
 And my spirit was lifted from me 
 And if only someone had the chance 
 To witness what happened to me 
 And I danced and I pranced and I sang with them 
 All had death in their eyes 
 Lifeless figures, they were undead all of them 
 They had ascended from hell 
 As I danced with the dead 
 My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me 
 Below my undead body just danced the circle of dead 
 Until the time came to reunite us both 
 My spirit came back down to me 
 I didn't know if I was alive or dead 
 As the others all joined in with me 
 By luck then a skirmish started 
 And took the attention away from me 
 When they took their gaze from me 
 Was the moment that I fled 
 I ran like hell faster than the wind 
 But behind I did not glance 
 One thing that I did not dare 
 Was to look just straight ahead 
 When you know that your time has come around 
 You know you'll be prepared for it 
 Say your last goodbyes to everyone 
 Drink and say a prayer for it 
 When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed 
 And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead 
 When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed 
 And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead 
 To this day I guess I'll never know 
 Just why they let me go 
 But I'll never go dancing no more 
 'Til I dance with the dead"

 To the woman and children the souls of the dead, 
 I've opened the book and no mercy is shed 
 You want forgiveness and you want it cheap, 
 I don't give redemption rewards for the meek 
 Suffering evil when you pay the price of fame, 
 There isn't a god to save you if you don't save yourself 
 You can't blame a madman if you go insane, 
 Give me the strength so I carry on 
 Trapped in the web but I cut the threads, 
 Show you the gates of tomorrow 
 Trapped in the web no mercy is shed, 
 Show you the gates of tomorrow 
 Trapped in the web slaves to the dead, 
 Show you the gates of tomorrow 
 Trapped in the web but I cut the threads, 
 Show you the gates of tomorrow 
 Suffering evil when you pay the price of fame, 
 There isn't a god to save you if you don't save yourself 
 You can't blame a madman if you go insane, 
 Give me the strength so I carry on 
 Trapped in the web but I cut the threads, 
 Show you the gates of tomorrow 
 Trapped in the web no mercy is shed, 
 Show you the gates of tomorrow 
 Trapped in the web but I cut the threads, 
 Show you the gates of tomorrow 
 Trapped in the web slaves to the dead, 
 Show you the gates of tomorrow"
148,Iron Maiden,metal,New Frontier,"Bleeding you dry from the start, the sum of my parts 
 To give it away, new life in a day 
 Some new Frankenstein, damned for all time 
 Cursed by the angel who fell, who saves me from hell 
 And who is my god? And where is my soul? 
 Too tired to jump, too young to run 
 Neverending, forever searching 
 Chasing dreams, the dreams of my heart 
 Always seeking, always asking 
 Questions right from the start 
 Out beyond the new frontier 
 Playing god without mercy without fear 
 Create a beast made a man without a soul 
 Is it worth the risk, a war of God and man? 
 I want to end my life now, but I don't know how 
 Recycled again a lifetime of pain 
 The spawn of a man, the devil has planned 
 Neverending, forever searching 
 Chasing dreams, the dreams of my heart 
 Always seeking, always asking 
 Questions right from the start 
 Out beyond the new frontier 
 Playing god without mercy without fear 
 Create a beast made a man without a soul 
 Is it worth the risk, a war of God and man? 
 Is it worth the risk, a war of God and man? 
 Neverending, forever searching 
 Chasing dreams, the dreams of my heart 
 Always seeking, always asking

 Create a beast made a man without a soul 
 Is it worth the risk, a war of God and man? 
 Is it worth the risk, a war of God and man?"
149,Iron Maiden,metal,Paschendale,"In a foreign field he lay, lonely soldier unknown grave 
 On his dying words he prays, tell the world of Paschendale 
 Relive all that he's been through, last communion of his soul 
 Rust your bullets with his tears. Let me tell you 'bout his years 
 Laying low in a blood filled trench, killing time 'til my very own death 
 On my face I can feel the falling rain, never see my friends again 
 In the smoke in the mud and lead, smell the fear and the feeling of dread 
 Soon be time to go over the wall, rapid fire and the end of us all 
 Whistles, shouts and more gun fire, lifeless bodies hang on barbed wire 
 Battlefield nothing but a bloody tomb, be reunited with my dead friends soon 
 Many soldiers eighteen years, drown in mud no more tears 
 Surely a war no-one can win, killing time about to begin 
 Home, far away, from the war, a chance to live again 
 Home, far away, but the war, no chance to live again 
 The bodies of ours and our foes, the sea of death it overflows 
 In no man's land God only knows, into jaws of death we go 
 Crucified as if on a cross, allied troops they mourn their loss 
 German war propaganda machine, such before has never been seen 
 Swear I heard the angels cry, pray to god no more will die 
 So that people know the truth, tell the tale of Paschendale 
 Cruelty has a human heart, everyman does play his part 
 Terror of the men we kill, the human heart is hungry still 
 I stand my ground for the very last time, gun is ready as I stand in line 
 Nervous wait for the whistle to blow, rush of blood and over we go 
 Blood is falling like the rain, its crimson cloak unveils again 
 The sound of guns can't hide their shame, and so we die on Paschendale 
 Dodging shrapnel and barbed wire, running straight at cannon fire 
 Running blind as I hold my breath, say a prayer symphony of death 
 As we charge the enemy lines, a burst of fire and we go down 
 I choke a cry but no-one hears, feel the blood go down my throat 
 Home, far away, from the war, a chance to live again 
 Home, far away, but the war, no chance to live again 
 See my spirit on the wind, across the lines beyond the hill 
 Friend and foe will meet again, those who died at Paschendale"
150,Iron Maiden,metal,Face In The Sand,"Everybody's waiting for something to happen, 
 Everybody's waiting for something to see 
 Lunatics waitin for bigger disasters, 
 Everybody's waiting for news on TV 
 Winding lives at the end of the spiral, 
 Waiting dictators with their next big thrill 
 Everyone's looking but no one is listening, 
 Everybody wants to be in at the kill 
 I wait for the signs, they tell me true, I see the signs of the end time 
 Everybody's searching but nothing's revealing, 
 Everyone's looking for the reason why 
 Everyone's hoping for life everafter, 
 Everyone's looking at death from the sky 
 Everyone's nightmares are going to happen, 
 Everybody's ripping the mask from their eyes 
 Everyone's praying but no one's believing, 
 Everyone's heroes tell everyone's lies 
 I wait for the signs, they tell me true, I see the signs of the end time 
 So I watch and I wait, and I pray for an answer 
 An end to the strife and the world's misery, but the end never came 
 And we're digging the graves, and we're loading the guns for the kill 
 Can the end be at hand? Is the face in the sand? 
 Future memory of our tragedy 
 Can the end be at hand? Is the face in the sand? 
 Future memory of our tragedy 
 So I watch and I wait, and I pray for an answer 
 An end to the strife and the world's misery, but the end never came

151,Iron Maiden,metal,Age Of Innocence,"I can't be compromising in my thoughts no more, 
 I can't prevent the times my anger fills my heart 
 I can't be sympathizing with a new lost cause, 
 I feel I've lost my patience with the world and all 
 And all the politicians and their hollow promises, 
 And all their lies, deceit and shame that goes with it 
 The working man pays everything for their mistakes, 
 And with his life too if there was to be a war 
 So we only get one chance can we take it, 
 And we only get one life can't exchange it 
 Can we hold on to what we have don't replace it, 
 The age of innocence is fading... Like an old dream 
 A life of petty crime gets punished with a holiday, 
 The victim's minds are scarred for life most everyday 
 Assailants know just how much further they can go, 
 They know the laws are soft, conviction chances low 
 So we only get one chance can we take it, 
 And we only get one life can't exchange it 
 Can we hold on to what we have don't replace it, 
 The age of innocence is fading... Like an old dream 
 You can't protect yourself even in your own home, 
 For fear of vigilante cries the victims wipe their eyes 
 So now the criminals they laugh right in your face, 
 Judicial system lets them do it, a disgrace 
 Despondent public worries where it all will end, 
 We can't protect ourselves our kids from crime the trend 
 We cannot warn each other of evil in our midst, 
 They have more rights than us, you cannot call that just 
 So we only get one chance can we take it, 
 And we only get one life can't exchange it 
 Can we hold on to what we have don't replace it, 
 The age of innocence is fading... Like an old dream 
 The age of innocence is fading like an old dream..."
152,Iron Maiden,metal,Journeyman,"From the red sky of the east, to the sunset in the west 
 We have cheated death and he has cheated us 
 But that was just a dream, and this is what it means 
 We are sleeping and we'll dream for evermore 
 And the fragment remains, of our memories 
 And the shadows we made, with our hands 
 Deeper grey, came to mourn, all the colours of the dawn 
 Will this journeyman's day be his last 
 I know what I want, And I say what I want 
 And no one can take it away, I know what I want 
 And I say what I want, And no one can take it away 
 But the memory still remains, all the past years not so strange 
 Our winter times are like a silent shroud 
 And the heartbeat of the day drives the mist away 
 And winter's not the only dream around 
 In your life you may choose desolation 
 And the shadows you build with your hands 
 If you turn to the light, that is burning in the night 
 Then your journeyman's day has begun 
 I know what I want, And I say what I want 
 And no one can take it away, I know what I want 
 And I say what I want, And no one can take it away 
 In your life you may choose desolation 
 And the shadows you build with your hands 
 If you turn to the light, that is burning in the night 
 Then your journeyman's day has begun 
 I know what I want, And I say what I want 
 And no one can take it away, I know what I want 
 And I say what I want, And no one can take it away"

154,Iron Maiden,metal,Different World,"You lead me on the path, keep showing me the way 
 I feel a little lost, a little strange today 
 I think I'll take a hold of whatever comes my way 
 Then we'll see what happens, take it day by day 
 I thought I had it all, I had it all worked out 
 Just what my future held that there would be no doubt 
 But then the card came up and I took another turn 
 But I don't know if it's fulfillment that I yearn 
 Tell me what you can hear and then tell me what you see 
 Everybody has a different way to view the world 
 I would like you to know, when you see the simple things 
 To appreciate this life it's not too late to learn 
 Don't want to be here 
 Somewhere I'd rather be 
 But when I get there 
 I might find it's not for me 
 Tell me what you can hear and then tell me what you see

 Left behind the loved ones waiting silent in the hall 
 Where you're going lies adventure others only dream of 
 Red and green light, this is real and so you go to war 
 For the passion, for the glory 
 For the memories, for the money 
 You're a soldier for your country 
 What's the difference, all the same 
 Far away from the land of our birth 
 We fly a flag in some foreign earth 
 We sailed away like our fathers before 
 These colours don't run from cold, bloody war 
 There is no one that will save you, going down in flames 
 No surrender, certain death, you look it in the eye 
 On the shores of tyranny you crashed a human wave 
 Paying for my freedom with your lonely unmarked graves 
 For the passion, for the glory 
 For the memories, for the money 
 You're a soldier for your country 
 What's the difference, all the same 
 Far away from the land of our birth 
 We fly a flag in some foreign earth 
 We sailed away like our fathers before 
 These colours don't run from cold, bloody war 
 Far away from the land of our birth

 Iron fingers stab the desert sky 
 Oh, behold the power of man 
 On its tower, ready for the fall 
 Knocking hands together well 
 Raise a city; build a living hell 
 Join the race to suicide 
 Listen for the tolling of the bell 
 Out of the universe 
 A strange love is born 
 Unholy union 
 Trinity reformed 
 Yellow sun, its evil twin 
 In the black, the wings deliver him 
 We will split our souls within 
 Atom seed to nuclear dust is riven

 Through acid veils of love and hate 
 Chain letters of Satan 
 Uncertainty lead us all to this 
 All nations are rising 
 Through acid veils of love and hate 
 Cold fusion and fury 
 Divide and conquer while ye may 
 Others preach and others fall and pray 
 In the bunkers, where we'll die 
 Where the executioners, they lie 
 Bombers launch with no recall 
 Minute warning of the missile fall 
 Take a look at your last sky 
 Guessing you won't have the time to cry

 A strange love is born 
 Unholy union

 Deliver good from ill 
 Clean the water, clean our guilt

 Then will my judge appear 
 Bear no false angel that I hear 
 For only then I will confess 
 To my eternal hell

 In the ships, the gimlet eyes await 
 The call to arms to hammer at the gates 
 To blow them wide throw evil to its fate 
 All summers long, the drills to build the machine 
 To turn men from flesh and blood to steel 
 From paper soldiers to bodies on the beach 
 From summer sands to armageddon's reach 
 Overlord, your master not your God 
 The enemy coast dawning grey with scud 
 These wretched souls puking, shaking fear 
 To take a bullet for those who sent them here 
 The world's alight, the cliffs erupt in flame 
 No escape, remorseless shrapnel rains 
 Drowning men, no chance for a warrior's fate 
 A choking death enter hell's gate 
 Sliding we go, only fear on our side 
 To the edge of the wire and we rush with the tide 
 Oh the water is red with the blood of the dead 
 But I'm still alive, pray to God I survive 
 How long on this longest day 
 Till we finally make it through? 
 How long on this longest day 
 Till we finally make it through? 
 How long on this longest day 
 Till we finally make it through? 
 How long on this longest day 
 Till we finally make it through? 
 The rising dead, faces bloated torn 
 They are relieved, the living wait their turn 
 Your number's up, the bullet's got your name 
 You still go on to hell and back again 
 Valhalla waits, Valkyrie's rise and fall 
 The warrior tombs, lie open for us all 
 A ghostly hand reaches through the veil 
 Blood and sand, we will prevail 
 Sliding we go, only fear on our side 
 To the edge of the wire and we rush with the tide 
 Oh, the water is red with the blood of the dead 
 But I'm still alive, pray to God I survive

 Oh, there is beauty and surely there is pain 
 But we must endure it to live again 
 Dusty dreams in fading daylight 
 Flicker on the walls

 What purpose to it all? 
 Eyes are closed and death is calling 
 Reaching out its hand 
 Call upon the starlight to surround you

 I won't be forgiven till I can break free 
 What did I do to deserve all this guilt? 
 Pay for my sins with the sale of my soul

 My hopes are gone reach for heaven from hell 
 My sins are many, my guilt is too heavy 
 The pressure of knowing of hiding what I know 
 I'm able to see things, things I don't want to see 
 The lives of a thousand souls weigh heavy down on me 
 I know they're crying for help, reaching out 
 The burden of them will take me down as well 
 The sin of a thousand souls not died in vain 
 Reincarnate still in me, live again

 Or man of holy war 
 Too many sides to you 
 Don't know which anymore 
 So many full of life 
 But also filled with pain 
 Don't know just how many 
 Will live to breathe again 
 A life that's made to breathe 
 Destruction or defence 
 A mind that's vain corruption 
 Bad or good intent 
 A wolf in sheep's clothing 
 Or saintly or sinner 
 Or some that would believe 
 A holy war winner 
 They fire off many shots 
 And many parting blows 
 Their actions beyond a reasoning 
 Only God would know 
 And as he lies in heaven 
 Or it could be in hell 
 I feel he's somewhere here 
 Or looking from below

 Please tell me now what life is 
 Please tell me now what love is 
 Well tell me now what war is 
 Again tell me what life is 
 More pain and misery in the history of mankind 
 Sometimes it seems more like the blind leading the blind 
 It brings upon us more of famine, death and war 
 You know religion has a lot of answer for 
 Please tell me now what life is 
 Please tell me now what love is 
 Well tell me now what war is 
 Again tell me what life is 
 And as they search to find the bodies in the sand 
 They find it's ashes that are scattered across the land 
 And as their spirits seem to whistle on the wind 
 A shot is fired somewhere another war begins 
 And all because of it you'd think that we would learn 
 But still the body count the city fires burn 
 Somewhere there's someone dying in a foreign land 
 Meanwhile the world is crying stupidity of man 
 Tell me why, tell me why 
 Please tell me now what life is 
 Please tell me now what love is 
 Well tell me now what war is

 Infernal sacrifice of hell

 Mounds of bodies as they all burn into one 
 Revenge is living in the past 
 Time to look into a new millennium 
 Spiral path leads through the maze

 The bridge of darkness casts a shadow on us all 
 And all our sins to you we give this day 
 Others wait their turn, their lives were meant to last 
 Use yours wisely as the light is fading fast 
 Free your soul and let it fly 
 Mine was caught, I couldn't try 
 Time returns again to punish all of us 
 We are cast out by our bloody father's hand 
 We are strangers in this lonely promised land 
 We are the shadows of the one unholy ghost 
 In our nightmare world the only one we trust

 That you ought to know 
 Two minutes of your time 
 Then on you go 
 Tell tale of the men 
 All dressed in black 
 That most of them 
 Not coming back 
 Sent off to the war 
 To play little games 
 And on their return 
 Can't name no names 
 Some strange yellow gas 
 Has played with their minds 
 Has reddened their eyes 
 Removed all the lies 
 And strange as it sounds 
 Death knows no bounds 
 How many get well 
 Only time will tell 
 Only time will tell 
 You lie in your death bed now 
 But what did you bring to the table 
 Brought us only holy sin 
 Utter trust is a deadly thing 
 To the prayer of holy peace 
 We didn't know what was lying underneath 
 So how could we be such fools 
 And to think that we thought you the answer 
 I can't begin to understand in all the lies 
 But on your death bed I can see it in your eyes 
 Just as clear as all the sweat upon your brow 
 It really makes sense I can see it clearly now 
 Tangled up in a web of lies 
 Could have been a way to prophesize 
 Unaware of the consequence 
 Not aware of the secrets that you kept 
 Nothing that we could believe 
 To reveal the façade of faceless men 
 Not a thing that we could foresee 
 Now a sign that would tell us the outcome 
 You had us all strung out with promises of peace 
 But all along your cover plan was to deceive 
 Can it put to rights now, only time will tell 
 Your prophecies will send us all to hell as well 
 Left to all our golden sons 
 All to pick up on the peace 
 You could have given all of them 
 A little chance at least 
 Take the world to a better place 
 Given them all just a little hope 
 Just think what a legacy 
 You now will leave 
 We seem destined to live in fear 
 And some that would say Armageddon is near 
 But where there's a life, well there's hope 
 That man won't self destruct 
 Why can't we treat our fellow man 
 With more respect and a shake of their hands 
 But anger and loathing is rife 
 The death on all sides is becoming a way of life 
 We live in an uncertain world 
 Fear, understanding and ignorance is leading to death 
 Only the corpses are left 
 For vultures that prey on their bones 
 But some are just not wanting peace 
 Their whole life is death and misery 
 The only thing that they know 
 Fight fire with fire, life is cheap 
 But if they do stop to think 
 That man is teetering right on the brink 
 But do you think that they care 
 They benefit from death and pain and despair"

 Must get through 
 Hear me now 
 For I've very little time 
 Not much time 
 Hear my call 
 Please get through 
 I am here 
 I'm stranded in space 
 I'm lost without trace 
 I haven't a chance of getting away 
 Too close to the sun 
 I surely will burn 
 Like Icarus before me or so legend goes 
 I think of my life 
 Reliving my past 
 There's nothing but wait till my time comes 
 I've had a good life 
 I'd do it again 
 Maybe I'll come back some time afresh 
 For I have lived my life to the full 
 I have no regrets 
 But I wish I could talk to my family 
 To tell them one last goodbye 
 The final frontier 
 The final frontier 
 The final frontier 
 The final frontier 
 If I could survive 
 To live one more time 
 I wouldn't be changing a thing at all 
 Done more in my life 
 Than some do in ten 
 I'd go back and do it all over again 
 For I have lived my life to the full 
 I have no regrets 
 But I wish I could talk to my family 
 And tell them that one last goodbye 
 The final frontier 
 The final frontier 
 The final frontier 
 The final frontier 
 There isn't much time 
 Must say my last rites 
 Nobody is here to read them to me 
 Must say my goodbyes 
 If only a line 
 A message to tell them in case they might find 
 For I have lived my life to the full 
 I have no regrets 
 But I wish I could talk to my family 
 To tell them that one last goodbye 
 The final frontier 
 The final frontier 
 The final frontier 
 The final frontier 
 The final frontier 
 The final frontier 
 The final frontier 
 The final frontier 
 The final frontier 
 The final frontier 
 The final frontier 
 The final frontier"
165,Iron Maiden,metal,El Dorado,"Got to tell you a story 
 On a cold winter's night 
 You'll be sailing for glory 
 Before you know what is right 
 So come over here now 
 I got a vision for you 
 It's my personal snake oil 
 It's just something I do 
 I'm the jester with no tears 
 And I'm playing on your fears 
 I'm a trickster smiling underneath 
 This mask of love and death 
 The eternal lie I've told 
 About the pyramids of gold 
 I've got you hooked at every turn 
 Your money's left to burn 
 You'll be wanting a contract 
 You'll be waiting a while 
 I'd like to give you my contact 
 But that isn't my style 
 Well, you only get one chance 
 And it's too good to miss 
 If I didn't lie to you 
 Then I wouldn't exist 
 Greed, lust and envy, pride 
 It's the same old, same old ride 
 The smoke and mirrors, visions 
 That you see are just like me 
 I'm a clever banker's face 
 With just a letter out of place 
 I know someone just like you 
 Knows someone just like me 
 El Dorado, come and play 
 El Dorado, step this way 
 Take a ticket for the ride 
 El Dorado, streets of gold 
 See my ship is oversold 
 You've got one last chance to try 
 So, gone is the glory 
 And gone is the gold 
 Well, if you knew the story 
 How come it has to be told? 
 Well, you can say I'm a devil 
 And I wouldn't say no 
 But out here on the dark side 
 Hey, on with the show 
 So, now my tale is told 
 Big and bad and twice as bold 
 This ship of fools is sinking 
 As the cracks begin to grow 
 There is no easy way 
 For an honest man today 
 Which is something you should think on 
 As my lifeboat sails away 
 El Dorado, come and play 
 El Dorado, step this way 
 Take a ticket for the ride 
 El Dorado, streets of gold 
 See, my ship is oversold 
 You've got one last chance to try 
 El Dorado, come and play 
 El Dorado, step this way 
 Take a ticket for the ride 
 El Dorado, streets of gold 
 See, my ship is oversold 
 You've got one last chance to try"
166,Iron Maiden,metal,Mother Of Mercy,"Sitting, waiting in the falling rain 
 Getting ready to begin again 
 Wounded, lying, crying 
 Bodies moving, dying 
 All around there is the smell of death and fire 
 Here the planes are coming 
 Hear the soldiers running 
 Killing on a scale to comprehend 
 Why are we here? 
 In this place here to kill 
 Please, God, forgive us for what we have done 
 I always thought I was doing right 
 As of now, I'm not feeling so sure 
 I'm at a place of where I give no grace 
 I'm a soldier of war 
 I sit waiting for my darkest hour to come 
 I cannot think about the things that I have done 
 It shouldn't take a fool to see that I believe 
 Accept the consequence, repent for what I've done 
 You tell me what is certain 
 But I'll tell you what is true 
 You tell me what is honesty 
 When all around is death and cruelty 
 The making of a man is fire 
 Not giving in to our desires 
 Within the truth that lies within the only thing 
 Mother of Mercy 
 Angel of death, desire 
 Mother of Mercy 
 Taking my last breath of fire 
 Mother of Mercy 
 Angel of pain 
 Mother of Mercy 
 Taking my last breath 
 Some say you are a lost cause 
 Some say you're a Saint 
 Just being here's an act of suffering and restraint 
 Walk down the long dark road to ruin, panic not 
 I'll die a lonely death, of that I'm certain of 
 Rivers flow with blood 
 There's nowhere left to hide 
 It's hard to comprehend there's anyone left alive 
 Sick of all the killing and the reek of death 
 Will God tell me what religion is to man? 
 I don't hold with bad religion 
 Understand what's underneath it 
 Now I come to think of it 
 I just don't hold at all, you know it 
 You say you are a holy man 
 But what is it you do? 
 From where I stand is nothing but a hollow man I see 
 Mother of Mercy 
 Angel of death, desire 
 Mother of Mercy 
 Taking my last breath of fire 
 Mother of Mercy 
 Angel of pain 
 Mother of Mercy 
 Taking my last breath 
 Mother of Mercy 
 Angel of death, desire 
 Mother of Mercy 
 Taking my last breath of fire 
 Mother of Mercy 
 Angel of pain 
 Mother of Mercy 
 Taking my last breath 
 I'm just a lonely soldier 
 Fighting in a bloody hopeless war 
 Don't know what I'm fighting 
 Who it is, or what I'm fighting for 
 Thought it was for money 
 Make my fortune, now I'm not so sure 
 Seem to just have lost my way"
167,Iron Maiden,metal,Coming Home,"When I stand before you shining 
 In the early morning sun 
 When I feel the engines roar 
 And I think of what we've done 
 Oh the bittersweet reflection 
 As we kiss the earth goodbye 
 As the waves and echoes of the towns 
 Become the ghosts of time 
 Over borders that divide the 
 Earthbound tribes 
 No creed and no religion 
 Just a hundred winged souls 
 We will ride this thunderbird 
 Silver shadows on the earth 
 A thousand leagues away 
 Our land of birth 
 To Albion's land 
 Coming home when I see the runway lights 
 In the misty dawn the night is fading fast 
 Coming home far away 
 As the vapour trails alight 
 Where I've been tonight 
 You know I will not stay 
 Curving on the edge of daylight 
 Till it slips into the void 
 Waited in the long night dreaming 
 Till the sun is born again 
 Stretch the fingers of my hand 
 Cover countries with my span 
 Just a lonely satellite 
 Speck of dust in cosmic sand 
 Over borders that divide the 
 Earthbound tribes 
 Flown the dark Atlantic 
 Over mariners stormy graves 
 We will ride this thunderbird 
 Silver shadows on the earth 
 A thousand leagues away 
 Our land of birth 
 To Albion's land 
 Coming home when I see the runway lights 
 In the misty dawn the night is fading fast 
 Coming home far away 
 As the vapour trails alight 
 Where I've been tonight 
 You know I will not stay 
 Coming home far away 
 When I see the runway lights 
 In the misty dawn the night is fading fast 
 Coming home far away 
 As the vapour trails alight 
 Where I've been tonight 
 You know I will not stay"
168,Iron Maiden,metal,The Alchemist,"Stranger than the comet as it streaks across the sky 
 Stranger than the truth I know before my open eyes 
 I have dealt in mysteries and trickery of light to entertain 
 Looked into the abyss, called it by its name 
 I have plundered time itself, put the world inside it 
 I'm the mysteries, day and night, divide it 
 A plague of wonders, on your knees beside me 
 Know the secrets, you shall not deride us 
 My dreams of empire from my frozen queen 
 Will come to pass 
 Know me, the Magus, I am Dr. Dee 
 And this is my house 
 I am the master of the tides 
 I shame the mirror in my sight 
 What random music of the spheres 
 Across the years 
 Know this 
 I will return to this land 
 Rebuild where the ruins did stand 
 Chain up the demons set free 
 Strange alchemy 
 Gather round the aimless and the feckless and the lame 
 Hear the master summon up the spirits by their names 
 I curse you Edward Kelley, your betrayal for eternity is damned 
 Know you speak with demons, you cannot command 
 Even as I looked into the glass then I was blinded 
 Burning by the Mortlake shore my house my books inside it 
 You have taken up my wife and lain beside her 
 Now the black rain on my house, the timbers burning 
 My dreams of empire from my frozen queen 
 Will come to pass 
 Know me, the Magus, I am Dr. Dee 
 And this was my house 
 I was the keeper of the books 
 I had the knowledge of the scrolls 
 But now through ignorance and fear 
 I cast a shadow through the years 
 Know this 
 I will return to this land 
 Rebuild where the ruins did stand 
 Chain up the demons set free 
 Strange alchemy 
 Know this 
 I will return to this land 
 Rebuild where the ruins did stand 
 Chain up the demons set free 
 Strange alchemy 
 Know this 
 I will return to this land 
 Rebuild where the ruins did stand 
 Restore the knowledge memory 
 Strange alchemy"
169,Iron Maiden,metal,Isle Of Avalon,"I can hear them floating on the wind 
 Immortal souls, their weeping saddens me 
 Mother Earth, you know your time is near 
 Awaken lust, the seed is sown and reaped 
 Through the western isle I hear the dead awaken 
 Rising slowly to the call of Avalon 
 The cauldron of the head of Annwyn laced with envy 
 Dark around its edge with pearl and destiny 
 All my days I've waited for the sign 
 The one that brings me closer to the Isle of Avalon 
 I can feel the power flowing through my veins 
 My heart is beating louder, close to Avalon 
 I can hear you, can you hear me? 
 I can feel you, can't you feel me? 
 Fertility Mother Goddess 
 Celebration, sow the seeds of the born 
 The fruit of her body laden 
 Through the corn doll 
 You will pray for them all 
 The image of Mother Goddess 
 Lying dormant in the eyes of the dead 
 The sheaf of the corn is broken 
 End the harvest 
 Throw the dead on the pyre 
 I hear her crying, the tears of an angel 
 The voices I hear in my head 
 Blessed the fruits are the corn of the earth 
 Mother Earth, holy blood of the dead 
 Mother earth I can hear you 
 Sacrifice, now united 
 Rising levels of the tidal lakes protect them 
 Keepers of the Goddess in the underworld 
 Holding powers of the Mystics, deep inside them 
 Nineteen maidens, guardians of the otherworld 
 Mortal conflict born of Celtic legend 
 That apart from seven, none returned from Avalon 
 Mother Earth, I can feel you 
 My rebirth now completed 
 Fertility Mother Goddess 
 Celebration, sow the seeds of the born 
 The fruits of her body laden 
 Through the corn doll 
 You will pray for them all 
 The image of Mother Goddess 
 Lying dormant, in the eyes of the dead 
 The sheaf of the corn is broken 
 End the harvest 
 Throw the dead on the pyre 
 To have the belief of others 
 Looking for the Isle to show them a sign 
 Fertility of all mothers 
 Stood in silence 
 Waiting now for their turn 
 The gateway to Avalon 
 The island where the souls of dead are reborn 
 Brought here to die and be 
 Transferred into the earth 
 And then for rebirth 
 I hear her crying the tears of an angel 
 The voices I hear in my head 
 Blessed the fruits are the corn of the earth 
 Mother Earth, holy blood of the dead 
 The water in rivers and rhynes rises quickly 
 Are flowing and flooding the land 
 The sea shall return once again just to hide them 
 Lost souls on the Isle of the dead"
170,Iron Maiden,metal,Starblind,"Take my eyes, the things I've seen in this world coming to an end 
 My reflection fades, I'm weary of these earthly bones and skin 
 You may pass through me and leave no trace, I have no mortal face 
 Solar winds are whispering, you may hear me call 
 We can shed our skins and swim into the darkened void beyond. 
 We will dance among the world that orbit stars that aren't our sun 
 All the oxygen that trapped us in a carbon spider's web 
 Solar winds are whispering, you may hear the sirens of the dead 
 Let the elders to their parley meant to satisfy our lust 
 Leaving Damacles still hanging over all their promised trust 
 Walk away from freedoms offered by the jailors in their cage 
 Step into the light, startripping over mortals in their rage 
 Starblind with sun 
 The stars are one 
 We are the light 
 That brings the end of night 
 Starblind with sun 
 The stars are one 
 We are 
 One with the Goddess of the sun tonight 
 The preacher loses face with Christ, religion's cruel device is gone 
 Empty flesh and hollow bones make pacts of love but die alone 
 The crucible of pain will forge the blanks of sin, begin again 
 You are free to choose a life to live or one that's left to lose 
 Virgins in the teeth of God are meat and drink to feed the damned 
 You may pass through me and I will feel the life that you live less 
 Step into my light, startripping, we will rage against the night 
 Walk away from comfort offered by your citizens of death 
 Starblind with sun 
 The stars are one 
 We are the light 
 That brings the end of night 
 Starblind with sun 
 The stars are one 
 We are one 
 With the Goddess of the sun tonight 
 Take my eyes for what I've seen, I will give my sight to you 
 You are free to choose whatever life to live or life to lose 
 Whatever God you know, He knows you better than you. Believe. 
 In your once and future grave, you'll fall endlessly deceived 
 Look into our face reflected in the moonglow in your eyes 
 Remember you can choose to look but not to see and waste your hours 
 You believe you have the time, but I tell you your time is short 
 See your past and future, all the same, and it cannot be bought 
 Starblind with sun 
 The stars are one 
 We are the light 
 That brings the end of night

171,Iron Maiden,metal,The Talisman,"When I stand and look about the port 
 And contemplate my life 
 Will I ever see my countrymen again? 
 As the captain calls us on the deck 
 I take my things and walk 
 To the harbourside, I glance back one last time 
 Fleeing our nation, our problems, we leave behind 
 Ships by the tenfold sail out on the tide 
 We are pleased to be out and embracing the open sea 
 Free from our troubles and more free from thee 
 Inheritors unfulfilled reason behind us 
 We flee from what is not what is will be 
 We flee the earth and face our harsh reality 
 Will death be low mist that hangs on the sea? 
 We run from evil tongues, rash judgements, selfish men 
 Never to be seen on these shores again 
 As we sail into oceansize and lose sight of land 
 Face of contentment around in the air 
 We're off now to seek all our fortunes 
 To the land of our dreams 
 Riding the waves and the storm is upon us 
 The winds lash the sails but the ropes keep them tight 
 Off in the distance a dark cloud approaching 
 None could imagine what there was to come 
 No, there's no one going back 
 No, there's not a second chance 
 As we strap onto the side 
 We pray to God that we won't die 
 As we ride the rough seas 
 As we soak from the ocean waves 
 I just hope for all our lives 
 And pray that I survive 
 Four ships are lost 
 In the stormy conditions 
 The spirits of the sunken crews 
 Their phantoms follow us 
 Spirits, sails, they drive us on 
 Through the all consuming waves 
 Cold mortality, no weapon 
 Against these ever raging seas 
 Four leagues and ten and we hit storms again 
 We just can't get away from the eye of the storm 
 The birds outsoar the raging storm, but we cannot escape it 
 Abandoned earth that we now crave is many leagues from safe 
 Holding on for our dear lives 
 And we're praying once again 
 Rotten luck or just jonahed? 
 The talisman is in my hand 
 Limbs fatigued, trembling with cold 
 Blinded from the sea spray salt 
 Clasping anything we can hold 
 Heaven's rain upon us falls 
 Twenty days without a meal 
 And ten without fresh water still 
 Those that didn't die in storms 
 The scurvy rest did slaughter 
 Westward the tide 
 Westward we sail on 
 Westward the tide 
 Sail by the talisman 
 We approach the other side of the ocean with the tide 
 In our favour just for once welcome greeting, our new land 
 The elation in our hearts, the excitement in our veins 
 As we sail towards the coastline of our golden promised land 
 Weary limbs fatigued away 
 I have no life left in me 
 No more strength and nothing left to give 
 Must find the will to live. 
 Never thought that we could make it 
 Truly sight of shores divine 
 The sickness I am dying from 
 Never wanted it to end this way 
 Westward the tide 
 Westward we sail on 
 Westward the tide 
 Sail by the talisman 
 Westward the tide 
 Westward we sail on 
 Westward the tide 
 Sail by the talisman"
172,Iron Maiden,metal,The Man Who Would Be King,"As he travels on the beast of burden 
 And moving up along the mountainside 
 As he gazes looking down the valley 
 No regrets but his pride 
 As he journeys across mountain passes 
 Insignificance sweeps over him 
 His reflection of the beauty 'round him 
 Feeling empty inside 
 He is running from his wildest thoughts 
 He is running from his everything 
 He is looking now to find something 
 Hoping he could be saved 
 He's searching for the answer now 
 It's something that he's managed to avoid up to now 
 Real conviction that he craves 
 He needs to find the answer sooner than later 
 Pushed himself to the limits 
 He had to strive for all the harder things in life 
 But what the cost of giving now? 
 His life, his time are the only things that he has 
 Life is not a rehearsal 
 All he has is the one chance to get it right 
 Leaving really is the only way to know 
 Maybe one day they'll forgive him what he's done 
 But now the pain of lying too early in the grave 
 Destiny, no good to hide away 
 Penance now will be his only way 
 Understand, no good to run away 
 Penance now will be his saving grace 
 He tries to make his peace with God 
 All is forgivable but it's left a little late 
 Trying something that he's not 
 Is it possible to change such a lot? 
 He's taken someone's life away 
 There's not a day goes by he regrets what he's done 
 He should have found another way 
 But the good book says, ""An eye for an eye."" 
 In reflecting on decisions that were made 
 On the judgements that will haunt him till his grave 
 No one has the right to take another life 
 But in his mind he had no choice, so be it 
 Destiny, no good to hide away 
 Penance now will be his only way 
 Understand, no good to run away 
 Penance now will be his saving grace 
 Destiny, no good to hide away 
 Penance now will be his only way 
 Understand, no good to run away 
 Penance now will be his saving grace

173,Iron Maiden,metal,When The Wild Wind Blows,"Have you heard what they said on the news today 
 Have you heard what is coming to us all? 
 That the world as we know it will be coming to an end 
 Have you heard, have you heard? 
 He sees them in the distance when the darkened clouds roll 
 He could feel tension in the atmosphere 
 He would look in the mirror, see an old man now 
 Does it matter they survive somehow 
 They said there's nothing can be done about the situation 
 They said there's nothing you can do at all 
 To sit and wait around for something to occur 
 Did you know, did you know? 
 As he stares across the garden looking at the meadows 
 Wonders if they'll ever grow again 
 The desperation of the situation getting graver 
 Getting ready when the wild wind blows 
 Have you seen what they said on the news today 
 Have you heard what they said about us all 
 Do you know what is happening to just every one of us 
 Have you heard, have you heard? 
 There will be a catastrophe the like we've never seen 
 There will be something that will light the sky 
 That the world as we know it, it will never be the same 
 Did you know, did you know? 
 He carries everything into the shelter not a fuss 
 Getting ready when the moment comes 
 He has enough supplies to last them for a year or two 
 Good to have because you never know 
 They tell us nothing that we don't already know about 
 They tell us nothing that is real at all 
 They only fill us with the stuff that they want 
 Did you know, did you know? 
 He's nearly finished with the preparations for the day 
 He's getting tired; that'll do for now 
 They are preparing for the very worst to come to them 
 Getting ready when the wild wind blows 
 He sees the picture on the wall, it's falling down 
 Upside down 
 He sees a teardrop from his wife roll down her face 
 Saying Grace 
 Remember times they had, they flash right through his mind 
 Left behind 
 Of a lifetime spent together long ago 
 Will be gone 
 They've been preparing for some weeks now 
 For when the crucial moment comes 
 To take their refuge in the shelter 
 Let them prepare for what will come 
 They make a tea and sit there waiting 
 They're in the shelter feeling snug 
 Not long to wait for absolution 
 Don't make a fuss; just sit and wait 
 Can't believe all the lying, 
 All the screens are denying 
 That the moments of truth have begun 
 Can't you see it on the T.V.? 
 Don't believe them in the least bit 
 Now the days of our ending have begun 
 Say a prayer when it's all over 
 Survivors unite, all as one 
 Got to try and help each other 
 Got the will to overcome 
 I can't believe all the lying 
 All the screens are denying 
 That the moments of truth have begun 
 Can't you see it on the T.V.? 
 Don't believe them in the least bit 
 Now the days of our ending have begun 
 When they found them, had their arms wrapped around each other 
 Their tins of poison laying near by their clothes 
 The day they both mistook an earthquake for the fallout 
 Just another when the wild wind blows"

 Here in this place for the taking 
 Clothed in white, stand in the light 
 Here is the soul of a man 
 Time to speak with the shaman again 
 Conjure the jester again 
 Black dog in the ruins is howling my name 
 So here is the soul of a man 
 When the world was virgin, before the coming of men 
 Just a solar witness, the beginning of the end 
 From a world of magma to a cold rock face 
 The ascent of madness and a human race 
 We are strange believers, all of us 
 There are stranger truths, immortal lust 
 We rise from slumber, he calls our name 
 Recalls our number, abide with pain 
 Reef in a sail at the edge of the world 
 If eternity should fail 
 Waiting in line for the ending of time 
 If eternity should fail 
 To God's illusion which I recall 
 Was our delusion, before the fall 
 The angels come and the angels go 
 But the lord of light shining below 
 Eternal blackness beyond the stars 
 We think our wisdom will get that far 
 At the master's table, the table's bare 
 No land of plenty, devastation, despair 
 Reef in a sail at the edge of the world 
 If eternity should fail 
 Waiting in line for the ending of time 
 If eternity should fail 
 Good day 
 My name is Necropolis 
 I am formed of the dead 
 I am the harvester of the soul meat 
 And I suck the lives from around my bed 
 My own two sons I gave them breath 
 And I filled their living corpses with my bile 
 What humanity I knew I have long forgotten 
 For me eternity is nothing 
 But a short while"

 On the edge that you can't see 
 Let's shoot the moon, you and me 
 I'm not particular you see 
 Just a lonesome galaxy 
 Shadows in the stars 
 We will not return 
 Humanity won't save us 
 At the speed of light 
 Shadows in the stars 
 We will not return 
 Humanity won't save us 
 We slip into the night

 Shooting plasma from my grave 
 Event horizon lost in space 
 Running in a human race 
 I don't know where I don't know when 
 But somehow back there time again 
 I'm on the edge that you can't see 
 I'm not particular at night 
 A single particle of me 
 You won't be tracking me by sight 
 Shadows in the stars 
 We will not return 
 Humanity won't save us 
 At the speed of light 
 Shadows in the stars 
 We will not return 
 Humanity won't save us 
 We slip into the night

 And the path to follow to the great unknown 
 Where the dark has fallen and the seed is sown 
 In the selfish hearts of some 
 The nightmare's coming 
 With the spilling blood of others 
 Now wringing through 
 Now the cup is spilling over 
 Wake to news of death 
 And the prophecy of sages 
 Destiny is met 
 To the depths of human mind 
 The cry is burning 
 With the mentor's anger 
 Of the lesson ringing true 
 And for those who live by 
 And are dying by the sword 
 They will take their ideals with them 
 Justify their end 
 Where the fools are lying 
 And the meek are crying 
 Where the wolves are preying 
 On the weak alone 
 Where the sons are dying 
 Hear their mothers crying 
 And the distant sound of fire 
 Begins again 
 Never ending the desires of men 
 It'll never be the same or calm again 
 In a time of changing hearts and great unknown 
 It'll be the damnation and end of us all 
 Where the fools are lying 
 And the meek are crying 
 Where the wolves are preying 
 On the weak alone 
 Where the sons are dying 
 Hear their mothers crying 
 And the distant sound of fire begins again 
 Never ending the desires of men

 A different shape every step I take 
 A different mind every step of the line 
 But in the end they are all mine 
 Laughing sorrow inside your head 
 Can't get out just a feeling of dread 
 I know this burden's a heavy load 
 A dark mistake never ending road 
 The black jack king and the red queen clash 
 The artful dodger he counts his stash 
 The joker's wild like an impish child 
 While madame fortune she waits inside 
 The good luck charm is overkill 
 The tired old soldier says fire at will 
 Planes overhead go search destroy 
 The ones below human decoy 
 I need somebody to save me 
 Meanwhile we play the waiting game 
 The clock is struck the horse is lame 
 And when we think that this is done 
 Chance your luck a four leafed one 
 You hedge your bets the battle lost 
 To wait in vain and count the cost 
 The thin edged line between good and bad 
 And cast the luck be happy sad 
 I need somebody to save me 
 The red and the black 
 People don't want the truth 
 Look in their eyes and you send them away 
 The red and the black 
 Fate and hypocrisy 
 Burden's a heavy load there is no doubt 
 The red and the black 
 All out of luck again 
 How many chances can anyone have 
 The red and the black 
 Treachery out to win 
 There in the wrong place and at the wrong time 
 I need somebody to save me"
178,Iron Maiden,metal,When The River Runs Deep,"Look for something that is hard to find 
 Searching somewhere deep inside your mind 
 Hope you find just what you're looking for 
 Heaven's waiting with an open door 
 If you should sell your soul as cheaply as I did then 
 The road to ruin is a long road to hide in 
 We signed our lives away to have an escape 
 It's something that will be whatever our fate 
 There's no use in hiding 
 Got to keep on trying 
 Can't take no more lying 
 This is the last 
 There's no time for crying 
 When some of us are dying 
 None of us decide 
 What is our fate 
 Now with nothing to hide going nowhere 
 Take my chances and stand by their sides 
 When the river runs deep and the line breaks 
 And the blood it flows free from our lives 
 Is this the last together maybe this time now 
 We stand together and we're holding the line here 
 There's nothing we can do just sit here and wait 
 The die is cast that is deciding our fate 
 There's no use in hiding 
 Got to keep on trying 
 Can't take no more lying 
 This is the last 
 There's no time for crying 
 When some of us are dying 
 None of us decide 
 What is our fate 
 Now with nothing to hide going nowhere 
 Take my chances and stand by their sides 
 When the river runs deep and the line breaks 
 And the blood it flows free from our lives"
179,Iron Maiden,metal,The Book Of Souls,"Sacrifices buried with kings 
 Accompany them on a journey with no end 
 To an afterlife that's rich with fruit of all the gods 
 And to face the demons of their underworld haunts 
 The sentient is sent to seek out all the truth 
 A flight to earth that is a given from his birth 
 To rise from ashes of the dead 
 Out of the fire is sent to fulfil man's desire 
 By power day and night and death he ruled them 
 The sky and earth and the fires too 
 Two headed reptile symbol of his reign 
 Universes of the underworld 
 A life that's full of all the wealth and riches 
 Can never last for an eternity 
 After living in a golden paradise 
 The ultimate sacrifice 
 Prophecy of sky gods, the sun and moon 
 Passing of old ways will come true soon 
 Falling of ages, forest of kings 
 The search for the truth, the book of souls 
 The rulers of planets and stars 
 The power of the kings of traders and the wars 
 Planetary cycles and the phases of the moon 
 Is in the document a kingdom they will learn 
 They were praying to the gods of nature 
 And were living in the cities of stone 
 Towers reaching upward to the heavens 
 Sacred wonders for the world unknown 
 Make their lives be a mystery no more 
 Records kept and the passing of laws 
 Sacred gods to the book of lies 
 When a civilization dies 
 Prophecy of sky gods, the sun and moon 
 Passing of old ways will come true soon 
 Falling of ages, forest of kings 
 The lost book of souls, destruction begins 
 Ascending the throne wearing feathers and shells 
 He brought back their lives from the void 
 Alien invasion brings nothing but death 
 Mass exodus and plant life destroyed 
 Domain of the earth to the journey of truth 
 The underworld caves mayan slaves 
 Defeat of the dark lords, the ultimate proof 
 In the place where the ancestors rule 
 The book of souls"
180,Iron Maiden,metal,Death Or Glory,"I see the enemy 
 I know he can't see me 
 Combat red in tooth and claw 
 Ready now for one more score 
 Took a bullet in my brain 
 Inside I'm the king of pain 
 Outside you will fear my name 
 I ride a blood red triplane 
 Turn like the devil, shoot straight from the sun 
 Climb like a monkey out of hell where I belong 
 Death or glory, it's all the same 
 Death or glory, the price of fame 
 Death or glory, I'm in the game of 
 Death or glory, a one way train 
 I watch you spiral down 
 Dead before you hit the ground 
 Bullet got you in the back 
 Deflection shooting beam attack 
 I shoot the gunner first 
 I kill to quench my thirst 
 I hunt the weakest prey 
 Live to fly another day 
 Turn like the devil, shoot straight from the sun 
 Climb like a monkey out of hell where I belong 
 Death or glory, it's all the same 
 Death or glory, the price of fame 
 Death or glory, I'm in the game of 
 Death or glory, a one way train 
 Turn like the devil, shoot straight from the sun 
 Climb like a monkey out of hell where I belong 
 Death or glory, it's all the same 
 Death or glory, the price of fame 
 Death or glory, I'm in the game of 
 Death or glory, a one way train 
 Death or glory, it's all the same 
 Death or glory, the price of fame 
 Death or glory, I'm in the game of 
 Death or glory, a one way train"
181,Iron Maiden,metal,Shadows Of The Valley,"Wandering aimlessly in a cold dark mist I follow 
 Walking in a dark world that's been kissed with sadness 
 Without sunlight things are born to the dead of nightmares 
 Soulless demons laughing in a sea of madness 
 Listen closely to the raven's call 
 Praying hard for our world not to end 
 Try as might to make sense of it all 
 Will it be for the penance of men 
 Follow north for the call of the wild 
 Look all out for a small wayward child 
 Lay in fear as the dark raven crows 
 Look for guidance from the one who knows 
 He lived on this earth for a time and a half 
 Playing a tune to the old man's laugh 
 The fear that's inside the men of the oath 
 In the script of the book that he wrote 
 Ask them the questions 
 Tell them no lies 
 A cry for freedom 
 Praying that they wouldn't die 
 Mind over matter 
 Cry over sins 
 Their lives are over now 
 Ended before they begin 
 As the raven again passes by 
 I can hear all the wake fathers cry 
 That the first born of all men will die 
 That their lives will be taken from them 
 Face the danger a battle of wills 
 Strength and courage a cure for all ills 
 We believe in that thou shall not kill 
 But others are ready to spill 
 The hearts of all men since beginning of time 
 Living with temptation wanting and crime 
 A walk in the shadow of the valley of death 
 Knowing I'll take my last breath 
 Ask them the questions 
 Tell them no lies 
 A cry for freedom 
 Praying that they wouldn't die 
 Mind over matter 
 Cry over sins 
 Their lives are over now 
 Ended before they begin 
 The hearts of all men since beginning of time 
 Living with temptation wanting and crime 
 A walk in the shadow of the valley of death 
 Knowing I'll take my last breath 
 Ask them the questions 
 Tell them no lies 
 A cry for freedom 
 Praying that they wouldn't die 
 Mind over matter 
 Cry over sins 
 Their lives are over now 
 Ended before they begin 
 Into the valley of death fear no evil 
 We will go forward no matter the cost 
 Into the valley of death follow me now 
 Bring me your souls and I'll make it our last 
 Ask them the questions 
 Tell them no lies 
 A cry for freedom 
 Praying that they wouldn't die 
 Mind over matter 
 Cry over sins 
 Their lives are over now 
 Ended before they begin"
182,Iron Maiden,metal,Tears Of A Clown,"All alone in a crowded room 
 He tries to force a smile 
 The smile it beamed or so it seemed 
 But never reached the eyes, disguise 
 Masquerading as the funny man do they despise 
 The false smile maketh of the man 
 Glass empty or half full 
 Try to make some sense or sorrows drown 
 All looks well on the outside 
 Underneath the solemn truth 
 There's something that inside has died 
 Tomorrow comes tomorrow goes 
 But the cloud remains the same 
 Wonder why he's feeling down 
 Tears of a clown 
 Maybe it's all just for the best 
 Lay his weary head to rest 
 Was forever feeling drowned 
 Tears of a clown 
 Who motivates the motivator 
 Facade it has to go 
 He knows it sooner or later 
 Smile for cameras, all ok 
 But tomorrow is another day he must get through 
 He had a longer way to run 
 Or so the story goes 
 Life full of fun where did it go 
 We saw the sadness in his eyes 
 It came as no surprise 
 And now of course we'll never know 
 Tomorrow comes tomorrow goes 
 But the cloud remains the same 
 Wonder why he's feeling down 
 Tears of a clown 
 Maybe it's all just for the best 
 Lay his weary head to rest 
 Was forever feeling drowned 
 Tears of a clown 
 Tomorrow comes tomorrow goes 
 But the cloud remains the same 
 Wonder why he's feeling down 
 Tears of a clown 
 Maybe it's all just for the best 
 Lay his weary head to rest 
 Was forever feeling drowned 
 Tears of a clown"
183,Iron Maiden,metal,The Man Of Sorrows,"Like a man without a home 
 Watching people come and go 
 Carry on their daily lives 
 Without a thought for the ones alone 
 Cast the dream aside like throwing 
 A pebble into the ocean tide 
 And I'm feeling so alone again 
 Free the angry from their pain 
 Free the captives from the chains 
 Cast aside the doubt that 
 Nothing good can come their way again 
 Living in a world of lies 
 No matter how or hard we try 
 Living life without a dream today 
 Looking through a mist of truth 
 That we believe an elusive cloud 
 The things we find are hard to say now 
 That we live through day to day 
 Find it hard to force the reasons 
 Why we find it hard to die 
 Now we need to know the truth now 
 Open our eyes that we can see 
 So we live and breathe again 
 Better days for you and me 
 Can we even hope to deliver this 
 We are so far away 
 As one turns against the other 
 With a brother against brother 
 Situation like no other 
 It's a picture of despair 
 As we look to see the man of sorrows 
 Passing knowledge to those who don't know 
 As we watch all our friends passing over 
 As they pass through the edges of time 
 And we see what's ahead that awaits us 
 That no longer do we feel afraid 
 So we look to see the man of sorrows 
 And the light is the darkness no more 
 As we look to see the man of sorrows 
 Passing knowledge to those who don't know 
 As we watch all our friends passing over 
 As they pass through the edges of time 
 And we see what's ahead that awaits us 
 That no longer do we feel afraid 
 So we look to see the man of sorrows 
 And the light is the darkness no more"
184,Iron Maiden,metal,Empire Of The Clouds,"To ride the storm, to an empire of the clouds 
 To ride the storm, they climbed aboard their silver ghost 
 To ride the storm, to a kingdom that will come 
 To ride the storm, and damn the rest, oblivion 
 Royalty and dignitaries 
 Brandy and cigars 
 Grey lady giant of the skies 
 You hold them in your arms 
 The millionth chance they laughed 
 To take down His Majesty's craft 
 To India, they say 
 Magic carpet float away 
 An October fateful day 
 Mist is in the trees 
 Stone sweats with the dew 
 The morning sunrise 
 Red before the blue 
 Hanging at the mast 
 Waiting for command 
 His Majesty's airship 
 The R101 
 She's the biggest vessel built by man 
 A giant of the skies 
 For all you unbelievers 
 The Titanic fits inside 
 Drum roll tight her canvas skin 
 Silvered in the sun 
 Never tested with the fury 
 With the beating yet to come 
 The fury yet to come 
 In the gathering gloom 
 The storm rising in the west 
 The coxswain stared 
 Into the plunging weather glass 
 We must go now 
 We must take our chance with fate 
 We must go now 
 For a politician, he can't be late 
 The airship crew awake 
 For thirty hours at full stretch 
 But the ship is in their backbone 
 Every sinew every inch 
 She never flew at full speed 
 A trial never done 
 Her fragile outer cover 
 Her achilles would become 
 An achilles yet to come 
 Sailors of the sky 
 A hardened breed 
 Loyal to the king and an airship creed 
 The engines drum 
 The telegraph sounds 
 Release the cords that bind us to the ground 
 Said the coxswain ""Sir she's heavy"" 
 ""She'll never make this flight"" 
 Said the captain ""damn the cargo"" 
 ""We'll be on our way tonight"" 
 Groundlings cheered in wonder 
 As she backed off from the mast 
 Baptizing them her water 
 From the ballast fore and aft 
 Now she slips into our past 
 Fighting the wind as it rolls you 
 Feeling the diesels that push you along 
 Watching the channel below you 
 Lower and lower into the night 
 Lights are passing below you 
 Northern France asleep in their beds 
 Storm is raging around you 
 A million to one, that's what he said 
 Reaper standing beside her 
 With his scythe cuts to the bone 
 Panic to make a decision 
 Experienced men asleep in their graves 
 Her cover is ripped and she's drowning 
 Rain is flooding into the hull 
 Bleeding to death and she's falling 
 Lifting gas is draining away 
 ""We're down lads"" came the cry 
 Bow plunging from the sky 
 Three thousand horses silent 
 As the ship began to die 
 The flares to guide her path 
 Ignited at the last 
 The Empire of the Clouds 
 Just ashes in our past 
 Just ashes at the last 
 Here lie their dreams 
 As I stand in the sun 
 On the ground where they built 
 And the engines did run 
 To the moon and the stars 
 Now what have we done 
 Oh the dreamers may die 
 But the dreams live on 
 Dreams live on 
 Dreams live on 
 Now a shadow on a hill 
 The angel of the east 
 The Empire of the Clouds 
 May rest in peace 
 And in a country churchyard 
 Laid head to the mast 
 Eight and forty souls 
 Who came to die in France"
