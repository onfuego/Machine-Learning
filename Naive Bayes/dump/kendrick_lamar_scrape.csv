 Sit still and close your eyes (smoke to it) 
 What's behind the other door? Oh-oh 
 No more silence (no more silence) 
 Don't kill this thing we got called love (don't shoot) 
 Just searching for the perfect shot 
 (Chorus: Angela McCluskey) 
 When love comes calling, don't look back 
 When love comes calling, don't look away 
 When love comes calling, don't look back 
 When love comes calling, don't look away 
 (Kendrick Lamar (Angela McCluskey)) 
 I used to write rhymes all day and all night 
 When y'all was playing PlayStation, my pencil was erasing lines 
 My conscience only knew what's half-tight 
 At 3:14, it's time to get me a slice my nigga 
 This is a dog's fight my nigga 
 The soundtrack to life my nigga 
 Kendrick Lamar, his momma called him that 
 He watched House Party and ate Apple Jacks 
 He sold Sega games, his cousin sold crack 
 He pumped Reeboks, his uncles pumped packs 
 Punk fake, jump-shot, ball hit the back 
 Ball dreams of being point guard was off limits Jack 
 That's because these Compton streets was built not to win 
 You killed the nigga, I stole a bible, is that a sin? 
 Part of me though, I'm searching for answers (just searching for the perfect shot) 
 The good kid from the ugly city that's mad that he's had some 
 Where is the love? 
 (Chorus: Angela McCluskey (Kendrick Lamar)) 
 When love comes calling, don't look back 
 When love comes calling, don't look away (where is the love?) 
 When love comes calling, don't look back 
 When love comes calling, don't look away 
 (Kendrick Lamar (Angela McCluskey)) 
 Give me rings, give me chains mayne 
 Give me a blue Benz, red Porsche, red Range 
 Give me black bitches, white hoes, new clothes 
 A mansion with marble floors and security codes 
 Then give me some landa, or maybe I'll land a 
 G5, clear port, say hello to the man 
 Give me awards, Grammies, and let the crowd applaud 
 My name till they strain the veins in they vocal chords 
 Give me fame and fortune, me and Trump on golf courses 
 With that being said, give me Tiger's sports endorsements 
 Give me billboards, whatever that people would kill for 
 Manhattan at 40/40, no forties but rose poured 
 Give me vanity, give me Kurt Cobain sanity 
 Give me a city where Channel 7 newscasters' cameras be 
 Give me horror like Amity, no, give me the charts (just searching for the perfect shot) 
 And if you ever renege, I'll still give you Kendrick Lamar 
 This is me, and that's love 
 (Chorus: Angela McCluskey) 
 When love comes calling, don't look back 
 When love comes calling, don't look away 
 When love comes calling, don't look back 
 When love comes calling, don't look away 
 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 Now everybody smoke to it 
 For this is, the celebration"
1,Kendrick Lamar,hiphop,Celebration,"Gimme that beat, fool 
 This a full time jack, no really this a Sounwave track 
 So really I ain't gotta steal nothing all I gotta do is kill it when you press record button let the paralyzed feel it 
 I came back with a full time swag and the critics thought they had me 
 Nah, I just bought more batteries 
 Turned up supercharged, a medium away from livin' large 
 Matter fact, where my niggas at? 
 Where my bitches with them pretty weaves? 
 Enemies bleed on the maxi pad, pussy you fucked with the wrong one I'm on one I'll make sure your kids breathe ammonia 
 Good kid, mad city evil in my heart from the blood niggas fuckin' with me crip niggas tryna kill me 
 Malcolm X mind state, if I raise the crime rate, it's a legitimate reason why I put on repeat Kanye's ""Touch The Sky"" 
 But I'll be looking passed that I'm tryna touch god 
 My heart to the heavens, the rebel of the reverend 
 Y'all married to the game well I'm bout to crash weddings 
 I put a lot of pain in the shit I write 
 If you goin' through something, this is shit you recite 
 This is bigger than life 
 This is Kendrick Lamar 
 This is Jimi Hendrix guitar on tall [?] I mean war like that 
 Yeah, straight like that 
 In 2010 I'm tryna ball, nigga! 
 Like shooting jumpshots in the mall, nigga! 
 That's a quote from Ab-Soul I suppose since you laugh that's the ultimate goal 
 On behalf of the Top Dawg conglomerate 
 Shall stay anonymous 
 Searchin' 7 continents accomplishing big shit 
 Big ass, big tits she on me 
 And just to get to me she'll fuck the homies-homie's homies 
 The life of a cool nigga 
 My nigga Tony said ""just do you, nigga!"" 
 Sure improve, nigga 
 And they gon' play you for a fool that's for sure till they know you got the stankiest stew, nigga! 
 I ain't trippin' I'm just tippin' on fo-fo's back in the city and tippin' on 4 hoes 
 That boy got a cold cold 
 He's sick con, slick on 
 Drop red jewels like a school bar mitzvah 
 Ooh 
 Straight like that 
 Why y'all complain about OG's? 
 I don't look at a legend and say you owe me 
 Not Snoop not Dre not Ice Cube 
 I don't care me and quik went to the same school 
 I look at the mirror and do it myself like a self made nigga 
 I don't need a maid, nigga 
 Do I need a cosign from Dre or Jigga? 
 They can make me much bigger, but do I need 'em though? 
 I just made a flow 
 The type of shit that make you think you seen Pac ghost ""Me Against The World"" on you motherfuckers 
 I got my back against the wall and a .45, dog get smoked, Chris Tucker 
 Uh, tryna record my steelo 
 Even when I'm not there just like TiVo 
 The hoes tell me that I got a real big ego 
 And weed move slow right now but E go 
 You know what I'm talkin' bout? 
 I look at your Audemars to put y'all in time out 
 It's time to unveil the real and your careers bout as frail as Ms. Winehouse 
 Just salute brother [?] and pull the wine out 
 Ooh, just like that"

 I said, oh, what up hoe? Oh, what up? 
 I said, oh, what up hoe? Oh, what up? 
 Well all right 
 I'm going through something with life 
 Where pussy and Patron make you feel all right 
 Pussy and Patron make you feel all right 
 Pussy and Patron, that's some great advice 
 I'm going through something with life 
 Where pussy and Patron make you feel all right 
 Pussy and Patron make you feel all right 
 Pussy and Patron, that's some great advice 
 Welcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairs 
 Something to inspire me, rather than society's 
 Woes, let me go, let me shine a lil' bit love 
 I want diamonds too, Ronnie on Player's Club 
 I used to have a nine-to-five, fresh out of school, that was '05 
 That bitch was racist, got me fired, ever since then, I had no job 
 Pushing in my mama van, stop for gas on Rosecrans 
 Trust me, these niggas rushed me for something my cousin probably did 
 Guilty by association, story of my life nigga! 
 You gon' make me flip, then split yo' shit, judge give me life nigga! 
 Pain since my grandma's death, uncle killed at Louie's Burgers 
 Hold my tears, I tried my best, let it go, drench my pullover 
 Cycles of a starving artist tryna go beyond the margin-margin 
 Maintaining my modest-modest as I dream 
 So while I go through all-this-all-this, bullshit what you call it 
 Life itself, I know it helps, let me scroll through my Blackberry 
 I'm going through something with life 
 Where pussy and Patron make you feel all right 
 Pussy and Patron make you feel all right

 I'm going through something with life 
 Where pussy and Patron make you feel all right 
 Pussy and Patron make you feel all right 
 Pussy and Patron, that's some great advice 
 I said, keep reading my diary when my life's entirely 
 Surrounded by the irony of living in the city 
 I said they wouldn't hire me, I said I got my ass beat 
 And the only thing can help is ass and some titties 
 So what's up baby? I said what's up? 
 I had a long day and I really wanna fuck 
 See I ain't tryna think about no phone bills, credit card late fees 
 Capital One popping up on my caller I.D. 
 Pawning my chain in the shop, watching for hollow tip shots 
 Watching my vehicle break down on another man's block 
 Man, that's my worst fear, ain't that your worst fear? 
 You know when your transmission go out and can't switch gears 
 Or run through a pothole at two in the morning 
 Scared to hit your emergencies, 'cause then they'll be on it 
 See I know, when the harsh reality takes toll 
 Open up your contacts, then scroll (""hey what's up daddy? "") 
 I'm going through something with life 
 Where pussy and Patron make you feel all right 
 Pussy and Patron make you feel all right 
 Pussy and Patron, that's some great advice 
 I'm going through something with life 
 Where pussy and Patron make you feel all right 
 Pussy and Patron make you feel all right 
 Pussy and Patron, that's some great advice 
 Ab-Soul: 
 Welcome to my diary, hmm, where should I begin? 
 Finna get a swisher and fill it with at least a gram 
 Crackers watch my every step, better yet they work my every nerve 
 Cutting me this worthless check, the concept is so absurd 
 Like a church in debt, a turtle in a turtleneck 
 Convertibles with turbo jets fueled by 7 Up and Prometh' 
 I feel like death's around the corner like the quickest wide receiver 
 So I took another shot, tequila hit me like a nina (blaow!) 
 My sky's gray, my bitch is brighter 
 Always saying ""Lights Please"", J. Cole's her ghostwriter 
 And I'm the God MC, join my diocese 
 Free ya mind, don't mind so-ciety 
 And finally, everyone got their own problems 
 Everything's subject to change like broken dollars 
 I'm a, drown in my drink and swim in woman's vagina 
 Like a Piranha fin, it gets harder than Rihanna when 
 Kendrick Lamar: 
 I'm going through something with life 
 Where pussy and Patron make you feel all right 
 Pussy and Patron make you feel all right

3,Kendrick Lamar,hiphop,She Needs Me,"(Kendrick Lamar) 
 One time 
 Reporting live, Compton, California 
 She go to work, she go to school 
 Her body smooth, no tattoos 
 Type of girl that make your mother feel comfortable 
 My pops love her too, she's compatible 
 She's independent, she handle her business 
 She believe in God and no other religions 
 Never in competition when it comes to her friends 
 She's dependable, she set her own trends 
 A confidant, a mediator 
 So sweet, every flavor 
 Just a conversation with her, doing you a favor 
 Look at her hips, I want to be her pager 
 Conservative, affirmative 
 Action when she relaxing in sweats and bobby pins 
 The beauty of her, a blind man could see 
 A true queen, and she needs me 
 She needs me, she needs me 
 She needs me, she needs me 
 The beauty of her, swear to God a blind man could see 
 A true queen, and she needs me 
 (Chorus: Javonte) 
 That girl is smoking 
 And can you believe that I'm her focus? 
 It ain't hard to see she got me open 
 And together, we are roller-coasting, on, on, on 
 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 Five years later, an accounting major 
 Work at a firm, abundance of paper 
 She got a career, she look in the rear- 
 View mirror of a Mercedes that she can steer 
 Private bars, executive meetings 
 Consecutive trips, vacation on weekends 
 Dior reeking through her Prada dress 
 Probably the only product of a pure success 
 Got a promotion, now she own the building 
 Headed to the top like she on the building 
 Real estate, property 
 She do tender steak, only one mouth to feed 
 Funded a youth center, invested in some stock 
 Doubled what she put in, then bought a restaurant 
 Oh what a girl, how great life can be 
 And though she got the world, she needs me 
 She needs me, she needs me 
 She needs me, she needs me 
 Oh what a girl, wonder how her life can be 
 And though she got the world, she needs me 
 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 We lose touch, separated 
 Years pass, I'm out dating 
 She's dating, one of Hollywood's 
 Famous of entertainers, Denzel good 
 Paparazzi spot 'em out shopping 
 Tuesday morning brunch, Benihana's 
 Tabloids paint the picture of a perfect couple 
 Headline reads, when a famous actor loves you 
 Emmy Awards, Academy too 
 On the red carpet, dress matching his suit 
 She holding his arm, she wave at her moms 
 Then wave at the world, got the world in her palms 
 Head in the clouds, star-gazing 
 Caught her on the stage, a proposal was waiting 
 He bent down, got on one knee 
 She looked him in the eye, and said she needs me 
 She needs me, she needs me 
 She needs me, she needs me 
 Even if we seem to separate, eventually 
 It'll come to pass, and she'll need me 
 I need her... we need we"
4,Kendrick Lamar,hiphop,I Am (Interlude),"See y'all don't understand me 
 My plan be is to win y'all hearts before I win a Grammy 
 Kendrick Lamar, words like a sword in the hands of a Spartan 
 Marching on Rosecrans in Compton 
 You can't cause conflict or corrupt my spirit 
 I'm on point like period 
 I've been there and gone before you get near it 
 Ooh wee, that young boy remind me of a young Martin Luther 
 The way he piece up troopers, then round up shooters 
 Like Malcolm X did, I stand for what I believe in 
 Family, God and honor 
 From Chicago, my daddy and my momma 
 Came to Compton to accomplish one thing 
 Raise a king, reign supreme, named Kendrick 
 I ain't lying, it stand for king and I am one 
 My unborn son and grandson will live royal 
 From the coochie to the soil 
 The meek shall inherit the Earth 
 Well I've had this world since birth 
 Feel the good kid's hunger 
 The Crips made strong, the Pirus made stronger 
 Muscle in my heart 
 Stare at the eyes of Mozart, then tell him I'm the genius 
 Do my dougie and grab my penis 
 'Cause I means this with all my soul 
 And you can't control greatness 'less you hating with the heart of Satan 
 But even that can't stop it 
 Nigga, get out my wallet and put passion in your logic 
 Passion in your life, the passion of my Christ is in me 
 And if you say it ain't, you may offend me 
 Damn that boy good 
 Bright as Thomas Edison, but Gucci manhood 
 He stood alone for so long 
 Prolonged his whole career, but now he's here 
 You can shoot shots or cheer 'cause I... am"
5,Kendrick Lamar,hiphop,Wanna Be Heard,"(Kendrick Lamar) 
 It's like I don't think you fully understand who I am, y'know? 
 I'm just a good kid from Compton that wanna rap 
 I don't represent no colors, I represent my lil' sisters and brothers 
 I'm the oldest, nigga 
 And if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack 
 Check it out 
 I used to wanna rap like Jay-Z 
 Until I finally realised that Jay wasn't me 
 I took my time to jot down every line that's a quotable 
 Critics say I don't be killing this shit but I know I do 
 Because I used to practice early morning and then after school 
 I'm working on my hooks my nigga, I ain't tryna battle you 
 But even if I did, I guarantee I'd overshadow you 
 Like a fucked up taper that turned to bowl cut 
 I'ma close cut to Common and Gucci Mane 
 Now that's a comparison that you probably wouldn't understand 
 Because I can touch the people and still keep it ghetto 
 As an '87 Regal with the tree air freshener on the rearview mirror 
 I wear a heart on my shoulder 
 'Member when we used to make the boost look like Motorola? 
 Your cousin fucked up your room every time he came over 
 Then went to jail when we got older 
 That shit is a bad odor, but still I remain focussed 
 In due time, I'll be able to swipe my card and it won't say decline 
 That shit's embarrassing huh 
 Hope no one pay you no mind 
 But it's a bad bitch behind you while you standing in line 
 Can you relate to my story? Can you follow my dreams 
 And admirations that I had ever since I was thirteen? 
 My momma believed in me, she let me use her van to go to the studio 
 Even though she know her tank is empty, that's who I do it fo' 
 My pops got a different approach, yeah he believed 
 But he always questioned when I'ma drop my debut CD 
 How long this gon' take nigga? You still haven't ate nigga 
 At twenty-two I had two cars and my own place nigga 
 It's a sacrifice I try to tell him 
 That's when he turn to BET and tell me that he jealous 
 Of all these niggas getting money and their shit don't sound like shit 
 I ate tryna kill your confidence or forcing you to quit 
 I just wanna hear you heard 
 Yep, yep, that's my word 
 Make a statement with these nouns and verbs 
 I represent the liquor that's poured out on the curb 
 Listen to my nouns and verbs (man I wanna be heard) 
 Like a cattle with sheep 
 While y'all sleep I re-up, cooking up all day 
 Like a mad scientist in that laboratory 
 Motherfuck what a critic got to say, I'ma be heard 
 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 What up Dasan? I ain't forgot nigga 
 You developed me, telling me I was hot nigga 
 You believed in me first, that's what's for sure 
 At the church recording, at the garage, but it worked 
 But me and Dave kind of felt you lost the passion 
 A lot was going on in your life and you needed space 
 But still I should have came to you first to tell you what happened 
 But I was seventeen and figured it's best I stay away 
 And I wrong, I was young and couldn't look you in the eye for what I'd done 
 But I'm telling you we ain't done 
 Matter of fact, how's your sons? What they up to? 
 Remember they used to run away while you had worked on ProTools? 
 People I used to be in the booth till four in the morning 
 With school in the morning, yawning, but I was on it 
 Me, you and Dave was on it 
 Buzzing like Charlotte Hornets when that tape dropped 
 Where them beats nigga? It's been five years since we had rocked 
 Time to be heard 
 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 So can you feel it? 
 When you hear it do it pulsate your spirit? 
 Does it make you wanna say motherfuck a gimmick? 
 The truth can set you free if you Do the Right Thing 
 Word to Spike Lee, don't he look like Sounwave? 
 That's kinda random, but my humor sometimes strays, like a dog in the night 
 Twenty-four hours in a day but only take five minutes 
 To grab a pad and a pen, then send your dog a kite 
 I spread love like a Hippy, but I'm a (Black) one 
 With Jesus Christ passion, I swear on the bible 
 Tabernacle to all my rivals, I ain't mad 
 You hate a nigga for tryna help you, that's your bad 
 Because I figure I can make a way with these stanzas 
 I probably can't heal cancer, but I can heal the city 
 My niggas, tell me you with me 
 And if you is won't you pop my CD in 
 Open up your trunk, then let it bump, so I can be heard 
 Yeah, uh huh 
 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 D-Dave, what up nigga? 
 Matt Jeezy [laughs]"

 Figured that I'd hit the NBA and make a fortune 
 Thank God for these rap recordings 
 I can ball like him on every verse and chorus 
 5-0-1s, Louis letterman jacket 
 Little brother only five, momma put him on my taxes 
 You know that Compton ghetto shit 
 That every Section 8 tenant is familiar with? Ooh wee 
 They say he something like the seventies, but I'm from '87 
 With a thousand dimes, you got eighty sevens 
 Gourmet sneakers, hair nappy 
 Fucking all my high school teachers, that was '05 bro 
 And I don't like 'em if the ass thin 
 And I don't wife 'em if a nigga is her best friend 
 The fuck I look like? 
 A billion bucks, and that's why

 The bitches think I'm the cutest

 She looking at the wrist like she wanna fuck it 
 Hating on her girlfriend just so I can fuck it 
 She say she on birth control, no I don't trust it, hoe 
 Uh, so give me fifty feet champ 
 Run until I got a bunion and my feet cramp 
 I'm in the hot spot, I know they seats damp 
 And I don't need your cosign, that's a cheap stamp 
 You niggas' check's cash 
 And I'm GT crashing, 1-0-5 off rap 
 Ay, that lil' nigga got it going on 
 G5, going-going-going gone 
 Cloud nine mind state 
 I drop a record, then I raise the crime rate 
 Killing this shit, where's your funeral tie? 
 A-B-C-D-E-F-G, fuck, skip to Y

 She looking at the car like she wanna fuck it 
 She looking at the wrist like she wanna fuck it 
 Hating on her girlfriend just so I can fuck it 
 Say she on birth control, no I don't trust it 
 Aooow~! First off, I'm a rider bitch 
 Put them twenty-sixes on a Silverado bitch 
 I keep my bitch with a finer bitch 
 Snap my fingers, she'll go and find a bitch 
 Tell them fuck boys that I do this 
 Got the best product round town, Frank Lucas 
 Confuse 'em like a Rubix cube when I roll up 
 Okay, Subway bread like some cold cuts 
 And I drop cold cuts, bitches go crazy 
 Wild like a Haitian, I should set up shop in Haiti 
 Fuck you, pay me, paper over pussy nigga 
 When I drop, you ain't getting paper nor pussy nigga

 Bitch I do this 
 Bitch I do this

 Boy, I thought you knew this 
 Bitch I do this"
7,Kendrick Lamar,hiphop,Uncle Bobby & Jason Keaton,"(Kendrick Lamar) 
 I was sitting on the couch, reading yellow paper 
 A letter in reply, seven days later 
 After I wrote him ""stay strong, keep your faith in God"" 
 What I told him, hoping that he's listening 
 Said that they tried to give him like a hundred years 
 What a coincidence, I was bumping some Plies 
 I can taste the salt from my tears 
 As the water had start to flood on my eyes 
 I know it gotta be hard being twenty-one 
 Doing time in the pen and your gramp's old 
 Your brother's getting older, and the streets is getting colder 
 And you're hoping that he's focussed to stay on the right road 
 Sleeping in a cell, it's been thirty weeks 
 Ain't received any mail, it's cold and the hole stinks 
 And you can't even blink without niggas testing your life 
 As I read every word that you write, I can only imagine 
 Jason Keaton, I can only imagine, yeah 
 (Chorus: Javonte) 
 Life's about decisions man 
 It's in your hand and you got it 
 Just take control if you can 
 It's in your hand and you got it 
 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 Sitting on the couch, that was my Uncle Bobby 
 After he just got out, fifteen years to count 
 Haven't seen the world in so long, haven't seen a girl in so long 
 And before the sun came up, he was gone 
 Like a fiend off the best rock 
 Trying to get his life together, or whatnot 
 Typed his name in the system and they couldn't find his identity 
 Got it straight, got a place, found some serenity 
 Found a job, found his mother gravesite, found a forty ounce 
 Then he found God, then he bounced 
 Then he found a new chick, two kids, wide hips 
 Found something in her we didn't see 
 Found this spot in Pasadena and shacked with her, an investment 
 Then found guilty, somebody had yelled domestic 
 Violence on my Uncle, was working with two strikes 
 Only out a year, now facing life, I can only imagine 
 That's fucked up, I can only imagine, Uncle Bob 
 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 Sitting on the couch, thinking 'bout the ratio 
 Of blacks in prison, it's compact in prison 
 When blacks packed with minorities, system grab more of these 
 Eighteen-year-olds, eighteen-year sentence 
 With no parole, the state won't oversee 
 They make the term severe, a conspiracy 
 That's what I call it, it's full of shit, a toilet can help quick 
 The government help? No, just put us on death row 
 Just give us some more guns, then give us some more coke 
 Then give us another chair, then give us some more rope 
 Then hang it like right there, yeah, it's justice for all 
 But ninety-percent unfair, care? Nah 
 Alcatraz was purchased by a white man for five grand 
 With intentions to expand, more prisons 
 So these correctionals ain't for rehabilitation 
 They for grossing a bigger business, imagine 
 We being used, imagine, the truth shall be told"
8,Kendrick Lamar,hiphop,Faith,"(Kendrick Lamar) 
 Cloud nine, Kendrick Lamar, uh 
 I take a sip of Hennessy and then get pissy drunk 
 I ain't a drinker, I'm a thinker, call it what you want 
 But if you turn your back, know that you just missed your chance 
 To witness the realest shit that's ever been told to man 
 I found myself losing focus at a Sunday service 
 Embarrassed so I started questioning God, what is my purpose? 
 He say to live the way he did, that's all he want from me 
 Spread the word and witness, he rose on the first Sunday 
 I said all right, enthused that my Lord gave a listen 
 I opened my bible and searched to be a better Christian 
 And this from a person that never believed in religion 
 But shit, my life is so fucked up man, I can't help but give in 
 I'm giving testimonies to strangers I never met 
 Hopped on the pulpit and told 'em how I was truly blessed 
 Felt like I'm free from all my sins when the service was over 
 Walked out the church, then got a call that my homie was murdered 
 And lost my faith again 
 (Chorus: BJ the Chicago Kid) 
 What am I gonna do? Gotta have faith 
 Life is too much, understood? Where is your faith? 
 Oh, faaaaaaaith... 
 All you need is the size of a mustard seed 
 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 Single black parent from Compton raising children of four 
 That's four innocent bastards, cause papa they don't know 
 Her day consists of working back and forth with babysitters 
 Can't find no one to watch her kids so she pay her sister 
 Her baby daddy ain't bout shit, that nigga ain't bout shit 
 Spent his daughter milk just to cop a new outfit 
 She pray to God every night hoping that he'll mature 
 And maybe one day his kids, something that he'll live for 
 Baby wanna go back to school but she need some help 
 Because it's hard tryna pay the bills when you're by yourself 
 She thought about credit card scams till she heard a voice 
 That said the Devil is a lie, make a better choice 
 And so it's back to McDonald's and every month dealing 
 With them crazy ass people at the county building 
 Looked to the heavens and asked 'em to make a better way 
 Then got a letter in the mail, lost her section 8 
 Then lost her faith again 
 (Punch) 
 Kendrick, I appreciate the opportunity to vent my nigga 
 This about how faith works, yeah, murk it... 
 I had dreams of holding a nine-milla to raise Killa 
 Ask him why as my eyes fill up 
 Each day it gets more realer, orangutans bang like gorillas 
 It's jungle when the niggas ensue 
 The rat's lurking, vulture's circling the serpents 
 Cats lying through they teeth, my nigga didn't deserve it 
 I flirted with the idea of caressing the steel 
 To make karma come faster than she normally will 
 It's ill, to see my faith try and leave me 
 It's so hard to get it, to get rid of it is easy 
 I'm tryna reach cloud nine, that's what my niggas bout 
 But it never rain in California 'less them pistols out 
 Until then, my feet planted on the ground 
 Shadowboxing my conscience till my faith start responding 
 And if I get no answer, just know I tried 
 I should have never looked into his son's eyes 
 Ray Charles voice 
 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 This for my people that stressing whenever times is hard 
 Your mind's slipping, wondering is there really a God? 
 Knowing you shouldn't think that way and tryna freeze your brain 
 But whenever it's pain, that feeling forever remains 
 We can't believe what we can't see and reality seems stronger than prayer 
 Cause you tried to change your life, and now you live in a wheelchair 
 And your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent care 
 At the tender age of twelve, and you feel that no one cares 
 Searching for answers, that's human nature, you ain't in the wrong 
 Just know, when you feeling that way his spirit's in the room 
 I watched people I know pray and catch the Holy Ghost 
 And wonder why I ain't never caught that feeling before 
 Maybe they know him better, or I don't know no better 
 But what I do know is that he's real and he lives forever 
 So the next time you feel like your world's about to end 
 I hope you studied because he's testing your faith again 
 I'd rather not live like there isn't a God 
 Than die and find out there really is, think about it"

 I'd like to welcome you aboard flight number F2B3 
 Our scheduled flying time will be four hours and twenty minutes 
 And we will be cruising at an altitude of thirty-three-thousand feet 
 At this time we would like to acquaint you with some of the features 
 Relax and breathe normally"" 
 Uh, coming down like I'm uphill 
 Hogging both lanes better than a bus will 
 She tell me that my head bigger than a bus wheel 
 But it don't matter 'cause she still gon' let me fuck still 
 I mix a little bit of Kendrick with some L.A. weather 
 Then step out like Chicago in its finest era 
 You niggas begging for attention, doing extra-extra 
 Downgrading yourself, you get an F for effort 
 Ha-ha, I let the world know 
 I chose to keep to myself and let the world go 
 And if you don't like a nigga, then let your girl know 
 So she can be curious on Twitter looking me up 
 I'm laid back with a bad one, you ain't never had one 
 Ass so fat that it tipped over the Aston 
 Speeding on the 1-0-5 till the fucking badge come 
 Hello to my wittiness, I'm Cadillac's grandson 
 And I'm a trip 
 Ever since an understudy man I've always been a trip 
 Mama tell me that she love me but she know her son a trip 
 Baby open up your ears, you ain't heard it like this 
 Sounwave drop the beat, I lock the flow down 
 Now all the way to the moon we bout to go now 
 I got enough of the mojo to go around 
 So pack your bags and tell him you going out of town 
 'Cause I'm a trip 
 Landing on another runway, fly with me 
 Or die tryna fly, a shot-down Frisbee 
 Shout out to Black Hippy, nigga we on 
 Like we never been off, straight shots of Patron 
 I'm give y'all the business to give y'all some business 
 Pussy ain't shit, I can give y'all some bitches 
 Clean off her sports bra, she clean off my dishes 
 Then wear off the Kangols, hood rats, I hate those 
 And she know what this is, hey lil' mama 
 Seen your pretty ass around the way lil' mama 
 But why you always in somebody face lil' mama? 
 Embarrassing yourself, get off the stage (Lil Mama) 
 Nigga, I gotta be that nigga 
 If I ain't, I gotta be that nigga 
 Curtesy of Paula's oldest son, pay homage 
 Or pay attention, open your eyes and hear knowledge 
 Gi-give me that, gi-gi-give me that 
 That's how I get at 'em when I look at a shoe rack 
 Penny for thoughts, mine start at a few racks 
 So I can live on a hill just off a few raps 
 I want to live in a space that none of y'all can visit 
 That might be outer space, the Jupiter district 
 I quadruple my vision 
 If you don't see it then you're dead with your eyes open 
 I've seen bullets hit the wheel, left his ride smoking 
 On some Compton shit 
 Somebody that'll ride or die, that's a Compton bitch 
 You see my city is the city of Lamar 
 It'll take twenty years 'fore a nigga see them all 
 The swap meet dumping, the sawed-off pumping 
 The tree for the low, don't you know, Paul Bunyan 
 I'm on cloud nine, I can see rain coming 
 So if I'm out my mind, people don't say nothing 
 ""How was your flight Mr. Lamar? 
 Good, hope to see you next time"""
10,Kendrick Lamar,hiphop,Vanity Slaves,"Uh-uh-uh, what up? 
 Uh, I'm tryna, what up? 
 Uh-uh, I'm tryna get something 
 Uh-uh-uh, I'm tryna, what up? 
 I say, what up? 
 Uh-uh, I'm tryna 
 Sometimes I wanna leave, sometimes I wanna cry 
 Sometimes I hate to bear the truth, sometimes I wanna lie 
 Sometimes I wanna school the youth, sometimes I wanna ride 
 Sometimes I wanna not think, sometimes I wanna vibe 
 Sometimes I wanna bump Tribe and zone out, this song 'bout a young boy 
 That's going wild inside, when my world collide 
 With your world where your girl and your kids reside 
 We kill the facades, we feel free to fly 
 We're birds that reserve in the charismatic sky 
 I care about my pride too much, if my clothes is new 
 If my ride is plush, if my hair is cut, if my diamonds is crushed 
 I look in the mirror, I'm trendy enough? Wrong 
 Insecurity roams the black community 
 Homes where kids must have jewelry 
 The high school female need earrings and details 
 So she can be cool to be amongst popularity 
 The various name brands that reach the price scan 
 That's not about the right price, but more like the right scam 
 To rule us all, confuse us all 
 Hit the bank within five minutes and then withdraw 
 Now let's draw the picture of a rapper with a chain 
 In a Range that is not paid for 
 My cousin from the South said he just bought him a house 
 That lives around his neck like a white collar 
 So why fast forward? Then I rewind 
 A time machine can help me double back to slavery times 
 Picking cotton from a field that a white man own 
 The blacker you are, farther you from the white man's home 
 Negro spiritual zones gave us some type of sanity 
 Before your vanity they parted our families 
 They put us in hundred-degree shade, and outside we bathed 
 The more we were afraid, the more they made rules 
 And trapped our minds in the cage, our freedom was so fake 
 Couldn't see it with the eyes of Tracee Ross, uh! 
 And school was exempt, see we couldn't have smarts 
 And a smirk could get you hurt, wound diversed from a scar 
 Four-hundred years of nothing, four-hundred years of suffering 
 Four-hundred years of tears and tribulation, miseducation 
 See what we facing is now coming, back to the roots 
 Remember whips on our back and if we would run they would shoot? 
 Call us niggers and figured that we'd never lived in pursuit 
 Of happiness, we captured these feelings in things that we do 
 Thought it's abstinence in slavery, but we made it come to 
 A modern perspective, my shoe selection gotta be Louie 
 Her handbag gotta be Gucci, it's fake then she foobie 
 She still bad though, and her fake Gucci ain't that bad though 
 We filling up the gas for Rollies 
 Upgrade to twenty-sixes, out there riding Kobes 
 My cousin from the South, slavery start in the South and I bet ya 
 He overcompensates for the life of his ancestors 
 So blame it on the four-hundred years we never saw 
 The reason why the next four-hundred we gotta floss 
 Slaves 
 Uh, I say the four-hundred years we never had nothing 
 Barely had clothes on our back 
 It's the reason why when we get a little bit of change 
 We over-exaggerate on our living expenses 
 So if you get your first big check and you cop a chain before you buy a house 
 You're a vanity slave 
 If you're a female and you got four, five, six rings on your finger 
 Four holes in your left ear and a nose piercing 
 You're a vanity slave 
 If you got an '02 Monte Carlo with twenty-fo's on it 
 And on the back of the window it says ""get on my level hoe"" 
 You're a vanity slave 
 We all vanity slaves 
 And with that being said, can somebody please tell me where the mall at? 
 I'm not from around here 
 Hey Ali, where we at? Idaho? 
 Yeah nigga, you know the first of the month 
 You know them checks come in 
 I'm tryna get something, but what up?"
11,Kendrick Lamar,hiphop,Far From Here,"(Kendrick Lamar - singing) 
 A nigga so goddamn stressed out 
 I feel like fuck everything right now 
 See I've been broke too long, can't find a job to save my life 
 But I'll be damned if I give 'em a handout 
 See my pride is one thing I will not put aside 
 I'm too proud to beg, I'm sorry Left Eye 
 If I don't make it in life, motherfucker I tried 
 What? Uh 
 (Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar) 
 You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you? 
 Not your momma, your poppa, only person is you 
 Not your brother, your sister, the only person is you 
 You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you? 
 Nobody, nobody but you 
 So it feels like, like it's only you 
 (Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar) 
 So I'm feeling like I want to, I want to 
 I want to, I want to go so far from here 
 Very, very far from here 
 I need to, I need to 
 I need to, I need to go so far from here 
 Very, very far from here 
 (Kendrick Lamar - singing) 
 It seems like, you can't win for losing 
 Whatever you're doing turns out to be ""what-are-you-doing?"" 
 Sitting pursuing, but your time will soon come 
 Nobody knows the position that you in 
 But it's a million people out there that's going through the same thing 
 That feeling, hard to explain 
 When you just, just want to get away 
 Something like 
 (Schoolboy Q) 
 Away from it all 
 Take me out of Hell where only Heaven can visit 
 The smartest astronomers, they won't even see my vision 
 I'm stuck on the studio couch, now I'm thinking bout my daughter 
 Times is getting harder, another beat is slaughtered 
 Just press record or, seems like I need a mill' to keep my shit in order 
 Instead of problem solving 
 From my hat to my shoes, spirit laced with pride 
 Set some shit aside to help me wipe my teary eyes 
 Reaching for the skies, pissing on a cloud 
 Shitting on a bird's head, higher than a dread 
 As I fly through the galaxy, pain and the agony 
 Nothing is surrounding me, living my life 
 Though it's better to write 
 Configuring my style to the streets, bring dark to the light 
 So how you feel? My nigga, I keep it real 
 A Schoolboy soon to be star, Mr. Lamar"
12,Kendrick Lamar,hiphop,Thanksgiving,"(Kendrick Lamar) 
 Reporting live, from Compton, California 
 North Cackalack 
 Now everybody just bow to the greatness, or die in the matrix 
 You're hereby dating, my destiny's waiting 
 My itinerary is very hectic 
 I break records on every record, I'm truly reckless 
 Kendrick Lamar, know how to maul with my wrist 
 Shout to writers for holding it down bitch 
 Me and my down bitch, get busy 
 I'm busy taking over, the world 
 With the weight of the world on my shoulder 
 My drive is not to be chauffeured 
 I'm live, come to the harvest, welcome the artist 
 Whose lyrics out of the orbit, more than the hardest rapper 
 To hit the market and market myself as a shooting target 
 With offers that got me up in these offices often 
 Boo-yaa, boo-yaa, no one, I've done situated myself, I ain't lying 
 Be sure to be friend cause my foes die five times 
 The good kid from the mad city 
 Holding a cereal box instead of a Glock 
 In a 1992 Caddilac that I got from my pops 
 Transmission slipping, but I ain't tripping, swallow my pride 
 Pop in my tape and roll the window, down 
 Like Stacie homie when airing out endo 
 I wish a nigga would 
 (Chorus: Kendrick Lamar) 
 A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop 
 A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop 
 A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop 
 Kendrick, show these muh'fuckers how we rock 
 A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop 
 A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop 
 A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop 
 Big Pooh, show these muh'fuckers how we rock 
 (Rapper Big Pooh) 
 Yo, it's evident, I'm evidently your favorite 
 All I ask, open your ears and please savor it 
 The taste is un-acquired, quietly, been inspired 
 I'm at a point in my life when I was getting tired 
 Now I'm brushing off the dust 
 We don't need no water, fire burned it to the dust 
 Nigga grind hard, roaches turning into musk 
 People hear his pain, I consider that a plus 
 I'm a grown man, so a few I have trust to Do the Right Thing 
 The Spike thing, consider me the in-between 
 The new regime taking over 
 Either we each other's opposition or you soldier 
 Used to have the whole state of NC on my shoulder then I passed it 
 Off to the next, you unlucky bastard 
 I'm getting drunk same time every year 
 To celebrate the life, Rosie no longer here 
 I swear 
 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 Me and Big Pooh like the definition of a two-man city zoo 
 Even zoos can beat up from punchlines 
 When I kick it and pump mine, I've got to be a prophet 
 I've gotta make a profit big enough to have a thirty pound wallet 
 I'm a Hub City representer, so I've got to represent the 
 City like a District Attorney being the case for killers 
 Might walk around in gurney, this is my sickest winter 
 Since I had the flu and flew in the hospital with the shivers 
 (Rapper Big Pooh) 
 U-P-S, I (deliver) 
 Little brown boy get the pick of the litter 
 No glitter, all guts, no glory 
 Station on repeat, they retread the same story 
 New niggas bore me, tryna progress to that old shit 
 Have a plate, that food for your soul tip 
 Drill it in your head, youngun it's that real Hip- 
 Hop along 'fore you get your little ass whipped"
13,Kendrick Lamar,hiphop,Let Me Be Me,"We on Ali? You ugly 
 Everybody just clap your hands if you're real 
 Middle finger up, give a fuck how they feel 
 Be yourself, just show me you're real 
 Middle fingers up 
 Just let me be me, hmm 
 That's the only way I know 
 Just let me be me, hmm 
 That's the only way I know 
 (That's the only way I know how to hold it down 
 That's-that's the only way I know how to hold it down) 
 Uh, I just wanna be me 
 No disrespect, but motherfuck you 
 My education stopped at a high school degree 
 But I can outsmart any high IQ 
 Draped in some fly shit, call me Jeff Goldblum 
 Cold, my style making my nose run 
 Oh, I stare at the mirror, then realize 
 That real lies, within me 
 Some say I'm crazy 'cause I think like I need a shrink 
 Ask too many questions about the stars and Earth shit 
 Rather be in the studio than out buying drinks 
 So if I'm not clubbing, don't think I'm on some jerk shit 
 And California on that jerk shit 
 But I'd just rather two-step like my first steps 
 Jill Scott in my iPod as my head rests, yes 
 And yeah I know I'm from Compton, Cali' 
 But I don't lace up Chucks or rock tan khakis 
 And skinny jeans ain't quite the lick 
 I probably would wear 'em but my dick don't fit 
 Ha-ha-ha, I like to joke, got a sense of humor? 
 Stale face, play me short like an Oompa-Loompa 
 You ain't gotta screw up your face in front of the kids 
 Won't you lighten up like Michael did? 
 I grew up with killers man, people who killed man 
 But my character never could be like them man 
 And they respect that, say that I'm real man 
 Not a fake person, that's the Sims man 
 Live my life through some film man? 
 I ain't acting out shit, I be packing out shows 
 'Cause they know they'll know Kendrick fo' sho', and oh 
 Almost lost my life to the industry 
 Had to look through a photo book to remember me 
 These label heads ain't nothing but bullshit 
 Have you with professional killers, chasing hits 
 Lying to yourself all over an image 
 Making records they want, that was wrecking my brilliance 
 My mama said, boy that don't sound like you 
 I said, this is the sound though, my only excuse 
 Quite frankly, dusted off my shoes with my hankie 
 And kicked it like he skate, make these motherfuckers hate me 
 The reason why they hate, cause these motherfuckers ain't me 
 And you can underrate me, but I know what I'm worth 
 A diamond in God's dirt, a diamond in winter 
 Watching Simpsons and eating some cereal for dinner 
 See I give you my life to mix it up in a blender 
 To make sure that you feel it

 What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar? 
 Kendrick Lamar, what are you trying to say? 
 What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar? 
 I think that I finally reached the pinnacle 
 Of finding myself as an individual 
 The world is so typical 
 I just wanna be higher than that 
 I used to want to be the messiah of rap 
 Infatuated with becoming a relevant star 
 Trying to say goodbye to the glamorous chains and cars 
 That I never had, but wrote it in my raps to make you mad 
 Vanity, they say that it can damage me 
 So do I really want it? 
 If I didn't, I guess I'm a cool cocaine connect 
 That means I'll be fronting, hmm 
 Cooking in a laboratory, hoping I can tell a story 
 That the whole world can feel, like the ones that came before me 
 Knowing that I'm misunderstood 
 So I gotta get my point across like a snitch would 
 And I would never walk in the shadow that never was really there 
 Or try to fill the shoes of an invisible pair 
 And Dame said he proud of my newfound honesty 
 And all I could say is, will the radio care? 
 Yeah, or should I say no? 
 Or should I just stop and come with a whole new approach? 
 You heard my Hip Hop when I was sixteen years old 
 Well that was me then, now I'm an adult 
 Twenty-two like the smallest of guns that you know, most determined 
 But with the smallest of funds to show, but I'm not worried 
 My talent should take me places I've never been 
 The world should turn soon as my record spin 
 I wanna be the highest, on top of all the bullshit 
 The negative you bring, the stress, the violence 
 The capital punishment, the loud police sirens 
 Too focussed, one word, righteous 
 And this is Kendrick Lamar 
 And soon y'all know cloud nine y'all 
 And that means I wanna be the highest 
 Too focussed, one word (righteous) 
 Mm, yeah 
 That means I wanna be the highest 
 Too focussed, one word

 Too focussed, too focussed, one word 
 Too focussed, too focussed, one word

 ""I want to describe my discovery in the simplest terms possible 
 Because it will reveal to you why it is true 
 That whatever the mind can conceive and believe, the mind can achieve 
 Regardless of how many times you have failed in the past 
 Or how lofty your aims and hopes may be"" 
 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 Go getter, with no cheddar 
 Just a white tee and a swap meet sweater 
 My life is likely to see great endeavors 
 But I can't win if I can't get it together 
 What I gotta do in order to see success? 
 Having the world's best to call me the best 
 Pull up at the Grammy Awards as best-dressed 
 With an address next to a beautiful actress 
 A dollar and a dream, I feel J. Cole 
 Word to the hole in my pocket and the hoes 
 That don't wanna fuck with a broke nigga with ambition 
 But the last I checked, y'all was broke bitches 
 Make a name for myself 
 Then bubble like the ass of Buffy when she wearing a tight belt 
 The homies on the block can say whatever they say 
 I don't wanna be a killer, I wanna be a Gates 
 (Chorus: Ash Riser) 
 Take your time, it'll come 
 Just stay focussed and humble my son 
 Show and prove, prove you're the one 
 It's not about who's dope, it's who wants it the most 
 So just go out and get it 
 Go out and get it 
 Go out and get it 
 Go out and get it

 What I gotta do in order to see success? 
 Having the world's best to call me the best 
 Pull up at the Grammy Awards as best-dressed 
 With an address next to a beautiful actress 
 Do I gotta run in your spot and blasting? 
 Better yet, rob the nearest Nix Check Cashing 
 Hear a hustle from a nigga that's constantly bragging 
 Catch him at the light, snatch him out his Jeep wagon 
 Or maybe I gotta hook up with Jose 
 Cop five bricks of the yay, head to the Bay 
 Area, or carry the birds to the gate 
 Let the clips distribute the work all day 
 Then come back home 
 Every three weeks, flip three-to-six zones 
 Homies on the block can say whatever they want 
 I don't wanna be a dealer, I wanna be a Trump 
 Donald that is 
 (Kendrick Lamar - over chorus) 
 And when I do it, I do it again, then I go back 
 When I do it, I'll do it again, then I go back 
 Thug it out, but for now I'm willing to dug it out 
 I gotta grind, grind 
 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 So welcome to the story of my life 
 See I'm tryna get right off the shit that I write 
 Make a fortune, buy some Porsches for my momma and the wife 
 Pop's engine in this old school run tight! 
 But as you listening to K. D-O-T 
 Me and my girl split the bucket at KFC 
 She listening to Drake and all I can say 
 Damn, these niggas that much better than me? 
 Baby, I don't think this is meant to be 
 'Cause I'm always losing self-esteem 
 She paused the iPhone, then said huh 
 I repeated what I said, then she replied shut up 
 You know you the best boy, you gotta keep doing it 
 But don't forget when you do, just keep you in it 
 And never listen to what the industry say 
 Don't be a typical artist, be more like Jay 
 Russell, Barry Gordy, Quincy Jones 
 Bob Johnson, Sean Combs, L.A. Reid 
 Young black entrepreneurs did what it took to succeed, yeah 
 So I gotta see success 
 I gotta make it off them Rosecrans steps 
 Rising to the top like a soda shook up 
 Bout to pop, and I'll pop on whoever's in my way 
 (Kendrick Lamar - over chorus) 
 Yeah, I swear to God I don't wanna do it, just live man 
 I wanna live good 
 Just wanna make my momma proud, y'know? 
 I don't wanna be hard, I don't want the most stripes 
 I got lil' brothers and sisters man, I'm the oldest nigga 
 I just want it, I just want it 
 And I'ma get it"

 I'll tell you what I don't believe in, can I do that? 
 All right, I don't believe in the, in laws, or the system by any means, whatsoever 
 I try not to obey them at any time 
 That's what I believe in, not believing in 
 (So what keeps you alive?) 
 Four big bottles of water a day, two packs of Marlboro Reds and 
 Uh, what keeps me alive? Shit, um 
 Music, I have to listen to music all day long 
 I say that keeps me going 
 I'm a pretty dark person, I've thought about ending it a million times 
 And I have to say that music keeps me here, by far, the main thing 
 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 Thank you 
 Sitting in the studio thinking about which mood would go 
 Right now, freestyle or write down, whatever 
 And still I come up clever, I just need to free my thoughts 
 And Lord knows that I know better, but I ain't perfect 
 I ain't seen too many churches or know them testament verses 
 You should either hear me now or go deaf 
 Or end up dead, die trying and know death 
 Might end up dead, swallow blood, swallow my breath 
 Fuck a funeral, just make sure you pay my music respect nigga 
 I mean that from the bottom of my heart 
 You see my art is all I have, and victory tastes sweet 
 Even when the enemy can throw salt 
 Still knock 'em out the park like a fucking tow car 
 Let bygones be bygones, but where I'm from 
 We buy guns and more guns to give to the young 
 I'm living the life of a nigga trapped nigga 
 Inside the system, all you envision is trap niggas 
 My uncle doing life inside prison, he wasn't wrapped too tight 
 He told me rap about life, not rap, niggas 
 That's why I'm shaking my head when you rap dissing 
 My stomach start turning, my nerves get to twitching 
 I start evaluating, then my final intuition 
 Is that you wishing a come up, would just come up 
 We used to beefing over turf, fuck beefing over a verse 
 Niggas dying, motherfuck a double entendre 
 And this is Compton, lions in the land of the triumph 
 Wrap Saran our defiance, ban our alliance 
 Put burners in the hands of the black man 
 One hood with twenty fo'-fo's like a cloned Kobe Bryant 
 You probably heard I wanna be heard and wonder who I am 
 You probably even listen to ""Faith"" and think I know Zion 
 But really I'm just caught in the loop of understanding the truth 
 Because it seem like it's always clashing with science 
 I got a big fear of flying 
 My future so bright I'd probably go blind before I blink twice, I ain't lying 
 I swear to God half of y'all just don't know Kendrick 
 The school of hard knocks, we was the first ones in attendance 
 You walking down the block, he got shot, you wouldn't know I witnessed 
 You just mind your bidness 
 You just turn your head, kneel down, and then tie your tennises 
 It's kinda scary ain't it 
 You can't act like no bitch, that only got Tyler Perry famous 
 Just let me explain this, why you pick up that stainless? 
 Cause your pops wasn't anxious to see you when you hated him 
 So much, you probably had your burner tucked in graduation 
 Said if you see him on them bleachers then you kill him, facing 
 Twenty-five to life with a murder charge 
 Your enemies was the prey, and now you pray to God 
 I pray these bars get farther than Compton 
 And if my record never break I still won't break my promise, I promise to keep it honest 
 Secret society, all we ask is trust 
 And all we lack is communication like service sucks 
 The people scared of annihilation when Kingdom Come 
 And I'm like, the Kendrick Lamar O.D. in less than a month 
 All right? Gotta keep it pushing 
 Can't let the government tell me how my future looking 
 I'm on Rosecrans and Central trying to duck the central bookings 
 If the fucking pigs get behind me then you know I'm bucking, never will I surrender 
 I've been a warrior when I came out of my mom's placenta 
 In the gutter lane like I'm Master Splinter 
 How splendid, I guess my project had did it 
 Got all these niggas approaching their mixtapes different 
 They said seven tracks, I said fifteen 
 Called it an EP, they said I'm tripping 
 But little did they know, I'm tryna change the rules 
 That we've been confined to, so the corporate won't make decisions 
 Uppity bitches, handling bidness 
 Killing our dreams, stealing our vision 
 Out in Haiti adolescents barely have a home 
 In L.A. everybody think they fucking on 
 Hop on Twitter, perpetrate, we doing big shit 
 Who we hanging with, and bragging about the iPhone 
 I swear to God, most y'all cats just don't know Kendrick 
 You barely know yourself, so I guess most of y'all should be offended 
 Ain't doing this for my health, I'm just trying to purchase my momma them businesses 
 Occupy my time with riches, justify my time, ambition's 
 Just to coincide, just to go inside, books we idolize while we living 
 Look the mastermind, took the master's mind, just the perfect time, just to mastermind 
 Just to master grind with precision, look the mastermind, took the... [coughs] 
 We would like to call this an appreciation tape 
 For those who recognized the Kendrick Lamar EP 
 For this is the Kendrick Lamar O.D. 
 Because of you, we are Overly Dedicated"

 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 Smoke to it nigga, smoke to it nigga 
 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 That's what she said to me 
 That place I used to call home is just a bed to me 
 And we don't even sleep, neighbors can hear her weep 
 Meanwhile I'm in these streets with everybody 
 I'm trying to get it and she know they got me, I watch her feelings watch me 
 As they staring with the saddest eyes of loneliness 
 Look each other in the face and barely blink 
 I tried to make it right but the pen ran out of ink 
 So if my letters don't reach you, I hope these lyrics in sync 
 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 That's what it said to me 
 But that place I call ambition now dead to me 
 Gone and forgotten, I'm off track like Dale Earnhardt 
 My liver rotten, alcoholic tripping 
 Fucking bad bitches and they got bad intentions 
 Club night, guys and dolls 
 Balling out, but I'm bout to drop the ball 
 I'm calling out for help, my engineer called 
 Told me come to the studio, I wanna tell him nah 
 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 That's what he said to me 
 But that place we call Heaven unfair to me 
 Only a hundred and forty-four can go 
 Seven billion people on planet earth today 
 Is there something that I don't know? 
 I know to follow him, rather following people 
 Or follow vanity cause that means I'm following evil 
 Guess I'm following evil, I should follow cathedral 
 Blessings I need, but live like I don't need you 
 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 So in conclusion 
 We all seem to stumble, planning our own demise 
 Forgetting the big picture and making it wallet size 
 So to what's important in my life, I apologize 
 I promise to stay faithful, focused and sanctified 
 We all get distracted 
 The question is, would you bounce back or bounce backwards? 
 Would you not know how to act or take action? It's just a part of life 
 And if your vision's impaired, you probably lose it all tonight 
 (Jhene Aiko) 
 I'm trying to visualize how to get it right 
 But my vision's so blurry 
 Trying to slow it down, stay close to the ground 
 But we're always in a hurry now 
 And if I could make this world stand a little slower 
 Then I would, then we could grow a little closer 
 I think we're getting closer 
 I think we're getting closer"
17,Kendrick Lamar,hiphop,Night Of The Living Junkies,"I remember, uh 
 All my uncles, Sir Smokers 
 On the landra, in front of our building 
 They was my heroes 
 This shit is so dope you might wanna be my crackhead 
 This shit is so dope you might wanna be my crackhead 
 Bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crackheads 
 This shit is so dope you might wanna be my crackhead 
 Uh, and that's scary to me 
 Dope beat, dope flow, vary to me 
 Especially when Sounwave is on his Ps 
 Nigga cue me in, I'm a Peruvian drug lord 
 Don't fast forward, I'ma serve you some +keys+ 
 This is crack cocaine, I'm Kurt Cobain 
 And I bang like a C-R-I-P 
 P-R-I-U, high you, I'm an I-V 
 This shit is so dope you might wanna be my crack... stop 
 I said an I-V 'cause when I be 
 In the studio, high shot, a needle in your vein 
 Take it in vain or itch till your eyeballs pop 
 I'm cold on the cold turkey, I hate chickens 
 But I do fuck pretty birdies, where your girl at? 
 Over the Pyrex where my world at 
 Uh, and that's scary to me 
 Every listener is a strawberry to me 
 You pussies ain't shit but venereal disease 
 Disease on K-Dot? Uh uh, better wake up 
 A nightmare, I'm right there like a Siamese 
 Twin, when you motherfuckers gon' learn? 
 Curl up like Big Worm when I drop 
 Who fly? I'm a red eye with eyedrops 
 I BIG, I 'Pac, you Chris, I +Rock+ 
 That's pookie hom', New Jack head-first with a cyclops 
 I'm the first one to do that, I bet you never knew that 
 Back like a tailbone, who you got to tell on? 
 If it ain't about me, about hoe 
 Or be about face if you ain't no higher, learn it 
 There's soda in the pot and the fire, burning 
 Uh, and it's scary to carry 
 A smooth-type flow like a drink of Merlot 
 That'll freak y'all out like a girl Virgo 
 When I turbo on any track it's a Reynolds wrap 
 And I rap like a nigga who invented rap, rapping heat 
 You could fall to defeat if you don't pay your tolls 
 Like the limbs on your feet, I suppose 
 This is bigger than life 
 This is probably everybody Illuminatis 
 Guess I'm the blood sacrifice 
 Of the party, I undress her like a Harley 
 Lights will flash, cars will crash 
 Smoke more junk while the junkies laugh 
 So my bad if I put you in rehab 
 You are reimbursed, put it on my, tab

 Aw dude, you about to fucking O.D. bro"

 I said, oh, what up hoe? Oh, what up? 
 I said, oh, what up hoe? Oh, what up? 
 Well all right

 I'm going through something with life 
 Where pussy and Patron make you feel all right 
 Pussy and Patron make you feel all right 
 Pussy and Patron, that's some great advice 
 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 Welcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairs 
 Something to inspire me, rather than society's 
 Woes, let me go, let me shine a lil' bit love 
 I want diamonds too, Ronnie on Player's Club 
 I used to have a nine-to-five, fresh out of school, that was '05 
 That bitch was racist, got me fired, they rushed us then, I had no job 
 Pushing in my mama van, stop for gas on Rosecrans 
 Trust me, these niggas rushed me for something my cousin probably did 
 Guilty by association, story of my life nigga! 
 You gon' make me flip, then split yo' shit, judge give me life nigga! 
 Pain since my grandma's death, uncle killed at Louie's Burgers 
 Hold my tears, I tried my best, let it go, trench my pullover 
 Cycles of a starving artist tryna go beyond the margin-margin 
 Maintaining my modest-modest as I dream 
 So while I go through all-this-all-this, bullshit what you call it 
 Life itself, I know it helps, let me scroll through my Blackberry (""hey what's up daddy?"") 
 (Beat switches up) 
 ""So what you wish me over here for? 
 How was your day? 
 Are you tipsy?"" 
 Mhmm 
 (Kendrick Lamar - screwed vocals) 
 All I need in this lifetime, pussy and Patron 
 Give me that, won't you give that? Once again it's on 
 Bitch I'm swagged up, hoes bopping when I'm off that Screw 
 Coming down clean, tell your baby mama what it do 
 Where your friends at? I got long dick, what it is 
 Go on poke it out, situate your little positives 
 How I live? Big shot, on my grind, all ready 
 I'ma lay it down like a carpenter when you let me 
 When you let me, when you let me... 
 (Kendrick Lamar - singing) 
 Give me that funk, that sweet, that nasty 
 That good shit stuff 
 I can't get enough 
 If I offend you, blame it on the liquor babe 
 Give me that funk, that sweet, that nasty 
 That good shit stuff 
 I can't get enough 
 If I offend you... 
 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 Uh, I wrote this song when Dave drove home 
 And caught that flat in the [?] flats 
 And it made me think when another car blinked 
 To change locations where we at 
 We often get lost in the ever-hard bottle 
 When attempt to ignore pain, problem and sorrow 
 Just for a minute, then back to the bullshit 
 Your car now due and you bout to get evicted 
 Two drugs surely, Patron, pussy, make it feel all right 
 But once it's empty and the bitch leave, then it's back to life 
 You can't run from it, gotta run to it nigga 
 The antidote wouldn't last and you knew it nigga 
 But still you proceed to dive deep, ask what's her zodiac sign 
 (Ab-Soul) 
 Okay, welcome to my diary, hmm, where should I begin? 
 Finna get a swisher and fill it with at least a gram 
 Crackers watch my every step, man I hate to work for them 
 One time I tried to work for me, but that shit didn't work for me 
 And here I am, stressing, questioning my direction man 
 What to do? Nothing's moving, traffic jam, wiggle through it 
 Pop the cork and take the fluid, bust that pussy open 
 Bust that pussy open, bust that pussy open 
 'Soul, balls deep, ya dig? 
 Retrieve relief, ya dig? 
 Let's kill a bottle of tequila 
 And lie butt-naked telling the truth, would ya? 
 What's up? I had a long day and I really want to fuck 
 Take a double shot to the face and forget about my whole day 
 Cause all I've been thinking the whole day... 
 (Kendrick Lamar - screwed vocals) 
 All I need in this lifetime, pussy and Patron 
 Give me that, won't you give that? Once again it's on 
 Bitch I'm swagged up, hoes bopping when I'm off that Screw 
 Coming down clean, tell your baby mama what it do 
 Where your friends at? I got long dick, what it is 
 Go on poke it out, situate your little positives 
 How I live? Big shot, on my grind, all ready 
 I'ma lay it down like a carpenter when you let me 
 When you let me, when you let me..."
19,Kendrick Lamar,hiphop,Alien Girl (Today With Her),"She look better than Beyonce, Alicia Keys, Halle Berry, Miss Jolie 
 Where's she from? No I.D., that girl's an alien 
 And if I die before I wake, I pray that I'm in outer space 
 U-F-O fly away 
 So let's go-go-go-go, let's go-go-go-go 
 Let's go-go-go-go, let's go, let's go 
 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 Uh, she got me going, I'm all in 
 Fifty stories, I'm falling 
 Where you been? Is it planet Mars? 
 Far beyond the stars? Are you a Martian? 
 You're unfamiliar, but still I feel ya 
 Energy is sending me toward the ceiling 
 I'm high now, are you up there? 
 If you was, I would climb every other stair 
 I gotta stare, I mean wow 
 And I'm wowed, no one compares 
 A one-on-one, you must have won 
 Every pageant in America when you was young 
 Lips, hips, hair drip down her back crazy 
 Body frame crazy, insane, crazy 
 The only girl that can make time, then make me stop 
 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 Uh, so now we on, so now we gone 
 Living in the city of the unknown 
 I show her off, I stunt with her 
 We do it sweet, they look bitter 
 Look at her get up, I hear 'em say 
 But why him? I hear 'em hate 
 I laugh at it, rather than jab at it 
 Then continue eternal life as a crack addict 
 'Cause I'm addicted, and you the drug 
 Cold turkey? No sir 
 Gotta be an odyssey from Heaven way above 
 You definite, not probably, I gotta give it up 
 Lips, hips, hair drip down her back crazy 
 Body frame crazy, insane, crazy 
 The only girl that can make time, then make me stop 
 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 You something different 
 I'm glad I found you 
 So pretty 
 I'll never do anything to hurt you"
20,Kendrick Lamar,hiphop,Opposites Attract (Tomorrow Without Her),"(Female crying) 
 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 Uh, yeah [3X] 
 Uh 
 We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us 
 Hurt people that love us, love people... 
 I'm inspired, so get inspired 
 And so he said, why you gotta be so kind-hearted? 
 Why you couldn't be a con-artist? Why you couldn't 
 Why you couldn't be mischievous or just a lil' devious 
 The moment that we first started? 
 Why you never ask for nothing, just a lil' time? 
 Why you let me use yours 'cause I don't got mines? 
 Why you always lift me up when I'm completely giving up? 
 Or when niggas holler what's up, you give a dry response? 
 Why you giving me your last, knowing you ain't got it? 
 Why you always buy me something when you going shopping? 
 Why you tell me that you love me? Why you always thinking of me? 
 Want my company rather than going club hopping 
 Why you treating my momma like she your momma too? 
 Why you making promises that you'll forever do? 
 Whatever just to make me happy, wanting us to have a family 
 These are exactly the reasons why I cheat on you, sometimes 
 (Chorus: Kendrick Lamar (Javonte)) 
 We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us 
 Hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us 
 Hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us 
 Hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us 
 (Sometimes I, sometimes I feel we share 
 Nothing in common, it ain't fair 
 But where do we seem to fall? 
 Where do we seem to fall? 
 Tender love and care, once upon a time 
 Once upon a time, we was there) 
 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 And so she said, why you gotta be so mean to me? 
 Why you don't know what you mean to me? 
 Why you always playing games? Why I feel like you ashamed 
 Out in public, curse me out and make a scenery? 
 Why you got other bitches rolling their eyes at me? 
 Why text messages popping up saying hi daddy? 
 Why you treat me like I'm nothing? Why you always at a function? 
 I be wanting to go out but you don't never ask me 
 Why you slip and say her name when we having sex? 
 Why you always assuming that I still love my ex? 
 Every time we get into it, I'm the one that's feeling stupid 
 You don't need me, you gon' leave me, that's your favorite threat 
 Why you never know how it feel to be lonely? 
 Why I feel I'm the last option after your homies? 
 Why you always gotta know that I will never let you go 
 Even though you get violent and put your hands on me? Sometimes 
 (Outro: Lamont Carey ""She Says She Loves Me"") 
 She says she loves me, she says she loves me 
 So she clings to me even when I want to be left alone 
 But she's beautiful 
 Like sometimes when I have things on my mind, she's the perfect person to listen 
 And she only gives advice, she says when I give her a cue 
 She says she loves me 
 Like when I wake up in the morning 
 She's sitting on the edge of the bed with a plate of food, wanting to feed me 
 She says she needs me, she says she loves me 
 Or like when I'm stepping out of the shower 
 She's standing there with the towel, wanting to, wanting to dry me off 
 She says, she says she loves me 
 So instead of admitting that she has made another mistake 
 She says, she says she loves me 
 And I don't know about love"

 I used to want to be like Michael Jordan 
 Figured I would hit the NBA and make me a fortune 
 (Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar) 
 Uh, every time I'm in my city I be hacking like my shit don't stink 
 Used to clean my Rollie chain with alcohol in the sink 
 Riding round with niggas that I grew up with since McNair 
 Bumping ""Me Against the World"", hello world, Kendrick here 
 And I'm too/two much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes 
 I'm too/two much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes 
 I'm too/two much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes

 Michael Jordan 
 Bounce-bounce hoe, bounce-bounce

 This shit make a nigga wanna get some bread or bust a head 
 Or fuck my enemy's bitch, acting bad and getting rich 
 Pull up on them twenty-sixes, I'm a vanity slave 
 I'm a sinner, Jesus Christ, please forgive me for my ways 
 I don't know why your bitch wanna fuck me 
 And I don't know why you fuck niggas can't see 
 I'm a Comp-town representer, concrete backflipper 
 A.K.A. that nigga, don't worry 
 I don't know why your bitch wanna fuck me 
 And I don't know why you fuck niggas can't see 
 This is HiiiPoWeR, since the Eddie Bower I've been popular 
 I'm popping now, every other hour, paparazzi come 
 You jocking her, let her be a hoe, why you stopping though? 
 We stopping the traffic, what you know 'bout them hockey pucks? 
 Skating on 'em, why you hating on 'em? You should learn from 'em 
 See too many of y'all getting money, know my turn coming 
 I don't know why your bitch wanna fuck me 
 And I don't know why... ""Hey, wait a minute motherfucker"" 
 (Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar) 
 Every time I'm in my city I be feeling like my shit don't stink 
 Used to clean my Rollie chain with alcohol in the sink

 And I'm too/two much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes 
 I'm too/two much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes 
 I'm too/two much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes 
 Wayne told me that, and that's just how it goes

 Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch 
 That means I'm too/two much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes 
 Wayne told me that, and that's just how it goes 
 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 Man, the game chose me, what am I to do? 
 Only thing I did wrong was make it possible 
 I diddy bop and make them titties pop 
 Out there on my bumper like a city cop 
 Walking down to Fred Segal, put my girl on it 
 Ass so fat, probably sit the world on it 
 Ay, pussy crazy, pussy crazy 
 You fuck niggas, you pussies crazy 
 Man, I know I can't tell you 'bout the world homie 
 But I know I can tell you bout your girl homie 
 Her pussy's crazy, her pussy crazy 
 I fucked nigga, I know you hate me 
 I know they pay me, too much of attention 
 Bring my name up, it gotta be mentioned 
 I need me an engine that go real fast 
 Call it ""Haul of Fame"", once it haul ass 
 Give me tall glass, Coconut Ciroc 
 Please no soda pop, I make my solo pop 
 Life's a bitch, her pussy crazy 
 But I make that pussy pay me 
 (Schoolboy Q) 
 I remember tripping, walking through the set like my Glock don't think 
 Grandma in the kitchen, neck bones in the sink 
 I don't know why your bitch wanna fuck me 
 And I don't why you sucker niggas can't see 
 I'm from Hoover mayne, high as Supermayne, shit you Lois Lane 
 You pussy mayne with the pussy game, shit we off the chain 
 We popping ay, fortune, not the fame, shit you backwards mayne 
 You chasing hoes, we replacing those, bag and pass them hoes 
 Your broad that chose, yes she moving on, yep we do it wrong 
 We fuck the homes, fuck the center home, marijuana strong 
 You know I'm gone, turn my swagger on, am I swagged enough? 
 My paper long, yep you left alone, you gets none fucks 
 Leaning off the Actavis, passing blunts round and round 
 Told Mary/merry was a (go), so we passed her (round) and (round) 
 Your bitch texted me, wants it now, so I had to knock her down 
 Work her bouncing on my balls, slinging dick up from the mouth 
 You let it slide, I hit home-runs, clean her dugout till I'm done 
 I can be her number two and you can be her number one 
 Her pussy's crazy, her pussy's crazy 
 You fuck niggas"
22,Kendrick Lamar,hiphop,Ignorance Is Bliss,"Lord forgive me 
 Kill him where he stand or stand over him shake his hand 
 Then jump back in that mini van, double back to his block 
 And blam I ain't backing down for nothing 
 I'm a back 'em down like Shaq with this black 2-2-3 in my hand 
 Better pray that this chopper jam, like a radio single, man 
 Police radio signals sayin' that a 187 land on your corner, 
 Coroners comfort your mama, mama he's dead, 
 The next morning high toasted up with my homies 
 We drink and smoke marijuana, want us to change our ways? Uh-huh 
 You see this game we play come from uncles that raised me in Compton 
 Ask me what I have accomplished 
 I don't know I don't have conscience 
 I just load up and start dumpin' on enemies I'm head hunting 
 No sympathy, ain't no love when you in these streets just get something 
 Protect ya neck 'cause they comin' for set respects split your onion 
 Then chop your deck your head tumblin' like gymnastics 
 Cause ignorance is bliss 
 This the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far 
 And I'm this far, from a discharge but never will I dish off 
 We all tryna ball and when I got the rock I'll dish off 
 Until the day I pistol whip you posers till y'all pissed off 
 Then peel off, in a hooptie 
 Come back and make these niggas wanna shoot me 
 And they bitches wanna salute me or seduce me 
 Indubitably I'm too street 
 Indubitably I'm a do me 
 Better than your bitch would 
 But you niggas too weak, but just give me 2 weeks 
 And I'm good 
 I'll make an album that'll put a smile on Malcolm 
 Make Martin Luther tell God I'm the future for Heaven's talent 
 No tarot card reading I'm foreseeing you niggas vanish 
 Not only from the rap game, I'm including the planet 
 Cats so watered down clowns can sink Titanic 
 Tie titanium around their neck and watch 'em panic 
 Give me respect, dammit, or get damaged 
 Die young, corpse identified by your parents 
 Apparently you a parrot 
 Mocking me and my blueprint 
 But I won't share it just make you cop it then call you a sheriff 
 Stop it, I'm hearin' the comments 
 The critics are calling me conscious 
 But truthfully, every shooter be callin' me Compton 
 So truthfully, only calling me Kweli and Common? 
 Proves, that ignorance is bliss 
 And this still the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far 
 And I'm this far, from a discharge but never will I dish off 
 This my world, I grab the universe then play kickball 
 And they wonder why these California earthquakes hit so hard 
 I'm so-Cal, you so called 
 Rappers need to go call 
 Ghostbusters to shoot busters I'm Casper when I go off 
 I show up, to show out to show off 
 You a hundred percent behind me 
 And if you hard then wreck your car and walk up to my crime scene 
 I remember being 17 wishing someone would sign me 
 Now the only way these labels get me back is when they rewind me 
 Backin' down boggins 
 Backin' down bitches 
 We gon' flip her once she off that blue dolphin 
 You gon' tip her 
 Cause ignorance is bliss 
 And Willy B I'm a fool on yo beats, I bleed out the speaker 
 As the speaker that spoke when they done speak"
23,Kendrick Lamar,hiphop,R.O.T.C. (Interlude),"(Kendrick Lamar) 
 This is me thinking at 4:43 AM, June 6 
 Sometimes I wanna say fuck rapping, I need money now 
 Like should I start trapping? If what I write down 
 Don't connect this very moment, then I'm on it, no question 
 In the streets my niggas is well connected, let's see 
 Do I cop a pound of kush, Promethazine or push some E? 
 Oxycontin have laying on soft cotton when I sleep? 
 This is deep as the abyss, I'm not just rhyming on the beat 
 I be in spots chopping the rocks like flintstone feet 
 This is me frustrated, battling my own evils 
 Finna saddle up that work, across Ohio in a Geo 
 Or should I sell my music .zip to buy your zip 
 And hope one day it flourish to a kilo, track record of a hustler 
 Rather records on the needle, making music 
 Clocking fast bank like a shot from Patrick Ewing 
 My nigga, what you doing on these corners with me? 
 ""I thought you had a show?"" Well I guess my nigga, I didn't 
 I'm tryna get this dough and easy money sounds tempting 
 Especially when your homies pushing V8 hinges 
 Twenty-two on twenty-sixes, Range Rovers rolling up 
 Three-fifty for an ounce of fire, I hope I got enough 
 This industry calling my bluff, I need a new solution 
 Curve-serving, know I might be in your store boosting 
 Two-elevens with MAC-11s like fuck Hip Hop 
 Don't wanna be Pun, don't wanna be B.I.G., don't wanna be 'Pac 
 Just give me your funds, A.K.A. everything that you got 
 Or everything getting shot, for nothing 
 Leave you in shock, coughing up blood and mumbling 
 Watch, the plans of a young man sponsor 
 Moving grams like relocating your mom's momma 
 Then expand to the Hoover dam, water 
 Sherm, contraband, they yearn for the butt-naked 
 Fuck a verse, verses get let off in thirty minutes, six seconds 
 I disperse to the world of unruly, where I put the mic down 
 And pick up a sack and a toolie, if you knew me 
 You'll know I always had a passion for riddle when writing 
 But lately I've been thinking bout taking chances to brighten 
 My future financially, so please don't be mad at me 
 I gotta do what I gotta do, no shit 
 So I tell my nigga front me, let me put it on the strip 
 Then give it back when I think about the consequence, shit 
 (BJ the Chicago Kid) 
 There are times, when you need someone 
 I will be by your side 
 Oh darling, cause there is a light that shines 
 Special for you, and me yeah 
 I-take-I-take-take my chances-chances-chances 
 Before they pass, they pass, they pass 
 Pass me by, oh darling 
 You've got to look at the other side

 One time 
 Reporting live, Compton, California 
 Have you ever felt like, like you never get life? 
 Like you never get right? Sort of like a black sheep 
 Back down, backing out your dreams like some bad sleep 
 Chasing for the win but you never win the track meet 
 Oh, what a cold world for a broke nigga, it's bitter 
 And life's a bitch, don't hit women so I bit her 
 I struck enough pain, let her know I wasn't playing 
 I was so (Sincere) like Nas' first name 
 And back, they'd tell me, it's very difficult to see twenty-five 
 And if I survive I probably wouldn't sell it 
 My opportunities are low because my brown complexion floats 
 In the ghetto, rather in some heals like Giuseppe's 
 They want me unemployed, until I hit the streets 
 For filling voids of broke D-boys selling weed 
 Fucking up my prestige, till I live with the blues 
 B.B. King or the neighbors of Snoop 
 (Chorus: Kendrick Lamar (Ash Riser) {uncredited female}) 
 That's why I'm in the club like fuck it though 
 They say it's only one life, life, life 
 And if you say I can't live comfortable 
 I'ma tell you that's a lie, lie, lie 
 So while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass 
 Celebrate the very day that I get past 
 (Through the barbed wire) 
 {We are, we are fighters 
 We are, we are true 
 Through the, through barbed wires 
 We will, will break through} 
 So while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass 
 Celebrate the very day that I get past 
 (Through the barbed wire) 
 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 Have you ever felt like, like you never get life? 
 Like you never did right? Sort of like a black sheep 
 Tryna get away from the world stereotype 
 Barbed wire got a barricade on your destiny 
 She desperately in need of some inspiration, see what the people saying 
 She gon' have a baby, then flee from her education 
 At the age of sixteen, credit card scam schemes 
 See a scar on her eye, boyfriend brutality 
 She will never get by, no how, no way 
 Welfare recipient, property of the state 
 Housing, Section 8, corner store, prostitute 
 The owner bout to prosecute, the niggas tell her that she cute 
 Hoodrat trashy, six baby daddies 
 And this baby daddy is new to the family 
 Chilling in pajamies, waiting on the first 
 Fast-forward, spilling drinks on her fur 
 (Chorus: Kendrick Lamar (Ash Riser) {uncredited female}) 
 That's why she in the club like fuck it though 
 They say it's only one life, life, life 
 And if you say she can't live comfortable 
 She gon' tell you that's a lie, lie, lie 
 So while she up in V.I.P. pouring Merlot in her glass 
 Celebrate the very day that she get past 
 (Through the barbed wire) 
 {We are, we are fighters 
 We are, we are true 
 Through the, through barbed wires 
 We will, will break through} 
 So while she up in V.I.P. pouring Merlot in her glass 
 Celebrate the very day that she get past 
 (Through the barbed wire) 
 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 Have you ever felt like you finally got life? 
 You finally got right? No longer a black sheep 
 Living off your (dreams) like Christina uh-Milian in the front seat 
 Of a convertible, eloping to get married 
 What a feeling of overcoming the odds 
 It's like you just hit the lottery, my God 
 There must be a God, cause golly 
 You done made it through the fight while squabbling, Ali 
 Now your lifestyle's looking up and you escaped the crooked cops 
 And you ain't have to kill a nigga just to make a couple bucks 
 And she ain't have to go and fuck on everybody for a dollar 
 Making good decisions, got an independent business mind 
 And both of y'all are steady grinding, doing it the legal way 
 Just tryna make a decent pay on every second of the day 
 But they won't give you the credit, disses out they mouth 
 You must have joined the Illuminati just to ball out 
 (Chorus: Kendrick Lamar (Ash Riser)) 
 In the club like fuck it though 
 They say it's only one life, life, life 
 And if you say they can't live comfortable 
 They gon' tell you that's a lie, lie, lie 
 So even if you overcame doubt and your living ain't bad 
 Know it's some barbed wire that's always in your path 
 (Through the barbed wire) 
 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 Just laugh, then everybody say 
 (Ash Riser) 
 'Cause I won't get caught again 
 And I'm here to start the trend 
 You can't catch me if you try 
 Disappear into the night, and I'm gone 
 ""So you made it past all the barbed wires?"" 
 Just one more left [gun shot]"
25,Kendrick Lamar,hiphop,Average Joe,"The hardest thing for me to do 
 Is to get you, to know me, within sixteen bars 
 That's the hardest thing 
 Who is K. Dot? A young nigga from Compton 
 On the curb writing raps next to a gun shot 
 On the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwell 
 The fraudulent tender scars that get unveiled 
 Everyone I knew was either crip or piru 
 Cousins in elementary, relatives in high school 
 With that being said, each one of their rivals 
 Was aiming something at my head, I needed survival 
 Got jumped, got jacked, shot at, shot back 
 And I don't even push a line, I'm just tryna push these rhymes 
 In the midst of staying neutral and discrete 
 My momma said you're judged by the company you keep 
 But what you can consider, that if it goes down 
 They'll kill you if you kill me, it gets deep nigga 
 So if you ask what I'm doing 
 I'm tryna duck the influence of my city that's blue-and,.. real talk, and 
 This is why they fuck with me (real talk nigga, believe it) 
 This is why they fuck with me (do what I do, y'know?) 
 I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (know that) 
 But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know 
 I was walking from Centennial 
 When an unidentified vehicle rolled up, and I was like hold up 
 Where you from? ""How-bang"" 
 Where you stay? ""Westside"", that's a piru gang to be exact 
 Well aware they had blue across they hat 
 Dropped backpack and ran inside of the cul-de-sac 
 Shots rang out, hoping to God I wasn't wet 
 Crossed to cross Rosecrans and ran inside of the yet 
 Chirped the homies on the hot ninety-five, they said they already knew 
 What happened, and meet 'em outside the garage 
 Never seen that many guns in my life 
 I was paranoid like a fiend in the night, but needed revenge 
 Grabbed the nine-ball, opened up the door, then got in 
 Somebody said fall back, we gon' make these niggas suffer 
 You my brother like a frat, and that's just to remind you 
 Thought about that so long I had failed my finals, fuck, but 
 This is why they fuck with me (I told you nigga) 
 This is why they fuck with me (you fake nigga) 
 I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (you fake) 
 But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know 
 I don't do black music, I don't do white music 
 I do everyday life music 
 Give 'em cuts like a nigga pierced a knife through it 
 You say you through, but I've been through it, now that's cold 
 And this is for my county building children 
 In Hub City on hubcaps, no power-steering 
 I use perseverance in this mad city 
 Where the niggas drink Remy and hold semis for cutthroats 
 Bernie Mac died, it's no joke 
 Don't ask why if you don't know about these killers and thieves 
 Seven grams of weed, you smoke that, but I'm high off life 
 I could fall out the sky like twice 
 And land in the land of the AKs 
 And the minivans where the fan never on 
 'Cause it's hotter than a lunatic's underarms in a straitjacket 
 In other words, we get it cracking, but I keep it cool, y'know? 
 This is why they fuck with me [laughs] 
 This is why they fuck with me (real talk) 
 I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (come on) 
 But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know 
 So there you have it 
 But I'm a leave you with this 
 An OG once told me 
 A real gangster is either dead or in jail 
 Or behind the scenes getting real money 
 I'm gone"

 All the real smokers give me H.O.C. 
 H.O.C. 
 Everybody know I spit that hunk of shit 
 Shit that make you duck for cover shit 
 Shit that make you hop out your seat and slap your mother shit 
 Especially when Drop drop the beat 
 I drop jewels like my nuts dropped out of my briefs 
 Jump in the booth, then shatter every rapper's dream 
 They jump in a sauna because I killed their self-esteem 
 That's a jab, you should bob and weave 
 Like Pam when Martin pulled jokes out his sleeve 
 I go in studio sessions and feel like a nerd 
 'Cause I'm the only nigga there not smoking no herb 
 You telling me the kush make you think on level four? 
 I'm on five, you saying I can level more? 
 In high school, my teachers thought I was smoking stress 
 Didn't know my eyes low cause of genetic defects 
 I stimulate my mind every time I think about the end of time 
 Creation of man and Columbine 
 Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote 
 Probably think I'm off the kush or the hydro 
 I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke 
 I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke 
 I really appreciate that you share your endo 
 But a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go 
 I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke 
 I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke 
 Look, nowadays everybody think they big chiefers 
 Just 'cause they heard that new tape from Wiz Khalifa 
 Knowing damn well they can't hit the sour 
 They new booties, they probably need baby powder 
 My skill shower over your city for forty days 
 Forty nights, off the chain like freedom of slaves 
 Before you get it twisted like forty gays 
 My flow worth the earth, that's not to be appraised 
 Those the type of lines that I'm talking bout 
 You know, the type of rhymes you don't talk about 
 Copy my session on a disc when the session ends 
 So my mama can have it and play it for her friends 
 Brag on me like my son's bout to win 
 Somehow, someday, and I don't care when 
 I might hit the gin once a month 
 I'll let you inhale/in hell, like an atheist 
 Uh, I'll take you back to the ninth grade 
 When Dough Boy had me high for four days 
 That's my nigga, he a street nigga 
 Probably in your hood fucking up your street nigga 
 But anyway, I think it was some purple 
 Told me don't hit it hard because it'll hurt you 
 I didn't listen, I was floating like the Rose Parade 
 Swear to God a nigga seen some flying fishes 
 That was the Vegas trip Hooters sponsored 
 The same time I start writing like a fucking monster 
 I'm Frankenstein every time this motherfucker ponders 
 Just underline every letter 
 Capital K-D-O-T, letting it flat out 
 Like a tire with slow leaks, and what you bout? 
 Nothing huh? Am I square 'cause I don't puff a square? 
 Are my raps too blunt to hit the blunt? Yeah 
 (Kendrick Lamar (screwed))

27,Kendrick Lamar,hiphop,Cut You Off (To Grow Closer),"Uh-uh-uh, uh, uh-uh-uh, uh 
 Ali, you thirsty on Twitter [laughs] 
 You boo-boo, you T 
 You turned down, you thirsty 
 You boo-boo 
 Uh, I'm tryna learn something new 
 I'm tryna find myself, I'm searching deep for Kendrick Lamar 
 I read about Napoleon Hill and try to know God 
 They say he the key to my blessings 
 And if I speak the good into existence, that instant my dreams will unlock 
 Money flow like water, I'll just wait at the dock 
 And by the way I'ma start, finding more light to shed 
 Like a small garage in your backyard 
 I'm back chilling with a friend of mine, she mighty fine 
 But I notice that her heart resides next to bitterness 
 Always hollering who she don't like, and who she kick it with 
 Who she wanna fight, who wearing a weave 
 Who Dooney and Bourke bag is fake, who holding the keys 
 To the car she drove last year, or who fucking on who 
 And who need a pap smear, getting on my nerves 
 But before your negative energy curve, bitch, I'ma cut you off 
 Cause every time you come around you be hollering that 
 Whoop-de-whoop, blase-blah 
 He say, she say, oh my God 
 Shut the fuck up... hoe 
 Every time you come around you be hollering that 
 Whoop-de-whoop, blase-blah 
 He say, she say 
 Uh, I'm tryna learn something new 
 I'm tryna surround myself with people that inspire me 
 Or at least inquire similar desires 
 To do what it T-A-K-E just to reach the T-O-P 
 I'm talking ideas, motivation 
 It's more than making enemies my nigga 
 Oh, that's not your memo? Then tell me why you constant stressing 
 On how much you well connected like centipedes my nigga? 
 I function with you and you flaunt your pistol 
 Every second tell me how you pressed him at the Monte Crystal 
 Where so-and-so from, and what neighborhoods beefing 
 Who baby momma's a rat, and who got killed last weekend 
 That shit is mad depressing, bringing me down 
 Speak on something with some substance that can get us both paid 
 Rather than telling me how these niggas jocking your style 
 Or his rims ain't bigger, pussy nigga, I'ma cut you off 
 Cause every time you come around you be hollering that 
 Whoop-de-whoop, blase-blah 
 He say, she say, oh my God 
 Shut the fuck up... scary ass 
 Every time you come around you be hollering that 
 Whoop-de-whoop, blase-blah 
 He say, she say 
 Uh, I'm tryna learn something new 
 I'm tryna better my chances of becoming a star 
 I'm tryna feel the vibe of Mona Lisa, studying art 
 Now paint that picture, life behind bars 
 Remember the very day I got caught? 
 I murdered a rapper, and you filed the police report? 
 See what I was taught, family is all I need 
 But indeed, them too can run me right up a tree 
 Constantly talking shit 'bout the next relative 
 Wanting me to take sides, but I'd never give in 
 Ever since grandma died everyone parted ways 
 Argue on holidays, left my uncle in prison 
 For fifteen years no one paid, him attention but moms 
 Yeah my momma as loyal as any sister would come 
 Come to my house just to yap about your own people, dang 
 And if your blood wasn't running through my veins 
 I would probably cut y'all off, too, yep 
 Cause every time you come around y'all be hollering that 
 Whoop-de-whoop, blase-blah 
 He say, she say, oh my God 
 Shut the fuck up... keep it running Ali 
 Every time you come around you be hollering that 
 Whoop-de-whoop, blase-blah 
 He say, she say 
 So tell 'em shut the fuck up 
 Tell 'em shut the fuck up 
 Yeah bitch you boo-boo, you T 
 You turned down, you thirsty 
 Tell 'em shut the fuck up 
 Tell 'em shut the fuck up 
 Yeah nigga you boo-boo, you T 
 You turned down, you thirsty 
 You thirsty, you boo-boo 
 You T, you turned down 
 You boo-boo, you T 
 You boo-boo, you turned down 
 You thirsty, you T 
 You boo-boo, you turned down 
 You boo-boo, you T 
 You turned down, you weak 
 You weak, yo' bitch weak 
 Yeah [laughs] 
 You boo-boo, you T [laughs] 
 Keep all that 
 What is HiiiPoWeR? 
 HiiiPoWeR is the way we think, the way we live 
 See it's known today that the human race is nothing 
 No moral, no standards 
 What we're about to do is raise the level of expectations 
 No you don't have to have a lot of money 
 You don't have to be rich 
 But you will be rich in mind and spirit 
 Some say it's as big as a crew, some say it's as big as a gang 
 HiiiPoWeR, we stand for it as if it's as big as a religion"
28,Kendrick Lamar,hiphop,Heaven & Hell,"My nigga, what it look like?"" 
 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 Niggas hating, bitches hating, babies dying 
 Bullets flying, helicopters, police sirens, preachers lying 
 Genosism, criticism, unemployment, racism 
 Burning buildings, AIDS victims, cancer killing, no cure 
 Oil spilling, turmoil, poverty-stricken 
 Police brutality kicking ass of us Africans, hostages in Afghanistan 
 Not to mention another prison, child molesting 
 Cow intestines, botox injection, earthquakes that's government testing 
 Secret society weapon, opium plant manifested 
 That turn to crack, then invest it amongst us blacks, just a method 
 To hold us back, great depression, amongst Iraq no direction 
 No google map, just a TEC for the soowoo 
 Swerving Isuzu, then blah-blah-blah, adolescents go cuckoo 
 Mothers are boo-boo crying, the governor keep us starving 
 These commercials keep us buying these cigarettes 
 Supermarkets fill up our liver with triumph, distinctive living with science 
 No place to live in, no Zion, see that's forbidden, we frying 
 ""My nigga, what it look like?"" 
 That's exactly what Hell look like, uh 
 (Chorus 2X: Alori Joh) 
 Tell it like it is, nigga 
 Tell it like it is, homeboy 
 Tell it like it is, nigga 
 Tell it like it is, tell 'em what's up

 What's up baby? It's been a while 
 You been good? I've been around 
 Different girls, different towns 
 To keep it real, you missing out 
 I'll all bored, next city 
 Random cars, TEC's with me 
 Like I miss you so much, have sex with me 
 Not right now, look you know I got the ex with me 
 She like fuck that, I don't care Dom 
 So selfish and that really isn't fair Dom 
 Meet me here, where Dom? 
 Get undressed, yeah Dom 
 Yeah Dom, what you need? 
 Some bomb head? A bag of weed? 
 Good food? Japanese? 
 That's me on page forty in that magazine 
 ""Dom Kennedy"" you need that 
 She said nobody come close, I agreed back 
 I'm the nigga who used to help her pull that weed back 
 And she need me, believe that

 That girl is smoking 
 And can you believe that I'm her focus? 
 It ain't hard to see she got me open 
 And together, we are roller-coasting, on, on, on 
 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 What's up love? It's been a while 
 You been good? I've been around 
 Remember dinner dates I was late? Mr. Chiles 
 Truant like a student, you the principal 
 Schooled me on timing, we was both shining 
 Like the sun bouncing off the brightest blood diamond 
 I was Your Highness, you was my queen 
 You got over him when I got in between 
 Watching Martin on TV as it was T-D-S 
 For us to eat TV dinners every time we was famished 
 But it was such a pleasure to watch you try to hold it together 
 Every time I put the head in you would panic 
 And come right down like an avalanche 
 Make your legs slant, whisper till you juicing up your pants 
 Baby how that sound? Kosher, no sir 
 Wake it back up, Folgers posters 
 By my waistline, shout for your hard hit 
 You called it a hate crime, say you want me back 
 And your girl wanna date Dom, that's high school shit 
 4-0-1 K, we could be friends with benefits, you dig that? 
 (MURS) 
 I upped and walked out, now she crying 'cause 
 She need me, I got that John Bryan love 
 Had to find love, we called it punch-drunk 
 We was a two-piece, she was a one-punch 
 You know, a knock-out, and if she was to walk out 
 My heart would go black, shrivel up and drop out 
 There we go again, what the fuck you talking bout? 
 We used to fuck all the time back at my momma's house 
 Smoking beedies, laying on the futon 
 Memories I got saved up like a coupon 
 And we'd be too gone off a sack of stress weed 
 I was broke then, couldn't count the best weed 
 Then she would just leave in a black hatchback 
 Homies from the hood used to ask me if I'd tapped that 
 I would say yep, smiling so freely 
 That was back then, but I bet she still need me 
 She need me, she need me 
 She need me, she need me 
 I would say yes, smiling so freely 
 That was back then, I bet she still need me"

 With no corns but enjoys eating vegetables 
 Seem like everybody love the role of assholes 
 But I'm feeling better being crowned with some bad hoes 
 Mr. Michael of [?] speaking 
 Fedora on the top, the black Abraham Lincoln 
 I hear they fell in love with my penis 
 Only concerned with my balls like Venus

 Huh, they say I'm rolling like a big shot 
 Kama Sutra missionary, fuck shit up on top 
 Say, I'm big time, Flavor Flav on a wristwatch 
 And all these chickens want that rooster, call it Big Cock 
 Co-co-co-cock that, aim and shoot that sure shot

 On that bandwagon of my genitals, not new to me

 Yeah, keep it simple stupid, all I see is trendy all around me 
 T.D.E. the movement, we Sore Losers out of Dallas County

 These hoes want to love me mayne 
 So I'm like, what up? Uh what up? 
 Uh, bitch I do this remix stupid, fire burning, people looting 
 That's the chaos, comes from K. Dot swinging swords and hanging nooses 
 Chunking deuces, then drop one, dropping music and I won 
 Call me hot or call me Pac, every eye on me and it's obviously 
 I'm close as next to kingdom come, I just run my city dude 
 You just make your city run, they hate to be next to you 
 Tables turn, say you earn rights to be the God MC 
 I'm bout to make that halo burn, goddamn that's some irony 
 I am the messiah of society 
 Beside of Halle Berry, feed me berries in Paris, oui-oui 
 I carry on a great endeavor, ambition leave all men grief

 Damn, why you say that? She said, ""Where my drink at? 
 I'mma tell you later, just tell your neighbors have the police relax"" 
 I stood up, shut the blinds, closed the screen, jumbotron 
 Made to the back where she reside, then she said, read between the lines 
 Yep, hope that I get close enough, when the lights turn down 
 And the fact that she just might open up, when the Nuvo start to drown 
 Her body and I know the both of us really deep in the move now 
 It's nothin' we can do now, somebody walked in with a pound 
 Of that Bay Area kush, she looked at me then looked 
 At it, then she grabbed it, then she said, ""Get it understood

 I know this girl, she a real good girl and she be low-key 
 Looking like a star, with a real nice car, a Mercedes key 
 She got a nigga and she love this nigga, well, at least I think 
 Every time we bark, she pay us no mind in the middle of the street, she be like 
 ""Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga 
 Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga 
 Fuck them other niggas, I'll ride for my nigga 
 I'll die for my nigga, fuck them other"" 
 Until one day he wasn't acting right 
 In the middle of the night, she checked his phone, Erica, right 
 When he plead the fifth, man, it was on, matter of fact she gone 
 Matter of fact Tyrone was on speed dial 
 So when she got home, it was going down, she go 
 ""Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga 
 Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga 
 Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga 
 Sick of lies from her nigga, fuck that other"" 
 I know this girl, she a real hood girl, and she with the shit 
 Keep her hair tied up, big bamboos, Mike Jordan kicks 
 With that big butt, but when I try to holla, she gon' resist 
 In her man she trust, so when I walk by her, she be screaming this, she be like 
 ""Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga 
 Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga 
 Fuck them other niggas, I'll ride for my nigga 
 I'll die for my nigga, fuck them other"" 
 Until one day he wasn't acting right in the middle of the night 
 She checked his pockets, found condoms by Magnum 
 And the moment they was acknowledged, she popped his eye 
 Then ran outside, then started driving on the passenger side 
 Homeboy was smiling, she gon' 
 ""Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga 
 Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga 
 Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga 
 Sick of lies from her nigga, fuck that other"" 
 And so, these girls, these vulnerable girls, took they men up 
 Put 'em in their world, their vulnerable world, and just like that 
 It was only getting they feelings hurt, tell me how that sound? 
 They got fed up with the biggest question mark, they curious now 
 'Cause when women get sick of men, they think of a big helping hand 
 To lend each other under cover emotions when lights dim 
 So when she telling her to come over, it'll be alright 
 The minute she hit the block and turn left, she'll be turning dyke, they 
 Fuck with other bitches when they tired of these niggas 
 Fuck with other bitches when they tired of these niggas 
 Fuck with other bitches on the side 'cause these niggas

 And Lord knows she's beautiful 
 Lord knows the usuals, leaving her body sore 
 She take the little change she make to fix her nail cuticles 
 Lipstick is suitable to make you fiend for more 
 She play Mr. Shakur, that's her favorite rapper 
 Bumping ""Brenda's Got a Baby"" while a pervert yelling at her 
 And she capture features of a woman, but only seventeen 
 The seven cars start honking, she start running like Flo-Jo 
 Don't care if they Joe Blow, if they got money to blow a blow job is a sure go 
 And sure enough don't see a dime of dirty dollars 
 She give all to her daddy but she don't know her father, that's ironic

 And Lord knows she's beautiful

 Her anatomy is God's temple 
 And it's quite simple, her castle is 'bout to be destroyed 
 She's always paranoid, watching the law inside the streets 
 Undercovers the dummies that look like decoys 
 Remember the sergeant let her slide, said if he seen 
 What's between her thighs he'd compromise, to no surprise 
 She took the ultimatum 'round the alleyway and gave him 
 A warm welcome that filled him right below the navel 
 Though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables

 As she bust down like a twelve bunk on tour 
 She suddenly realized, she'll never escape the allure 
 Of a black man, white man, needing satisfaction 
 At first, it became a practice, but now she's numb to it 
 Sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it 
 But she never heard of Catholic religion or sinners' redemption 
 That sounds foolish, and you can blame it on her mother 
 For letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover 
 Ten months before she was ten he moved in and that's when he touched her 
 This mothafucka is the fucking reason why Keisha rushing through that 
 Block away from Lueders Park, I seen the El Camino park 
 And in her heart she hate it there but in her mind, she made it where 
 Nothing really matters, still she hit the back seat 
 And caught a knife inside the bladder, left for dead, raped in the street, Keisha's song

 The day that I wrote this song, set her down and pressed play

 Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard 
 Flagging down all of these flashy cars, oh 
 Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard 
 Flagging down all of these flashy cars"

 Real quick, Ali 
 Got me breathing with dragons 
 I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard 
 I'm Marilyn Manson with madness, now just imagine the magic 
 I light to asses, don't ask for your favorite rapper 
 (He dead), yessir (Amen), Chuuch 
 (He dead), I killed him, (Amen), Bitch 
 And this is rigamortus and it's gorgeous when you die 
 Ali recorded, and I'm Morpheus, the matrix of my mind 
 I'm out the orbit, you an orphan and a hairdresser combined 
 I'm on the toilet when I rhyme, if you the shit then I decline 
 I climax where you begin and then I end on cloud nine 
 And that's important when you morph into a angel in the sky 
 And don't be forging all my signatures, my listeners reply 
 And tell me that you biting style, you got a hell of an appetite 
 And I'mma be here for a while just buckle up before the ride 
 Or knuckle up, if you could fight, we always making 'em duck or die 
 A suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide 
 CSI just might investigate this fucking parasite 
 (He dead, amen) That's what they telling me 
 Aim it at your celebrity, this is studio felony 
 Ferragami so many and cool enough for the seventies 
 Nigga, payback's a bitch and bitch you been living in debt with me 
 Dead 'em all and especially, leave a call on his mother voicemail 
 To say that he rest in peace, bigger chopper the recipe 
 Wrestling, that's irrelevant, rather rest at your residence 
 Whistling to the melody, couldn't think of a better D 
 Better be on your P and Q, it's just me Jay Rock, Soul and Q 
 Solar system and barbecue, nothing else you can do 
 (He dead), yup-yup, (Amen), I killed him 
 (He dead), haha, (Amen), amen 
 Got me breathing with dragons 
 I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard 
 I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper 
 (He dead), yup-yup, (Amen), I know 
 (He dead), for sure, (Amen), amen 
 Got me breathing with dragons 
 I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard 
 I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper 
 I rapped him and made him Casper, I captured the likes of NASA 
 My pedigree to fly past ya, I pass the weed to the pastor 
 We all are sinners, won't you send us to bible study faster 
 Your hypocrite-esque reaction a blasphemy, I assassin my casualty 
 And it's casually done and tell 'em my salary come 
 A lump sum of hundreds don't talk to me 'bout no money 
 The sun is under my feet and I come in peace to compete 
 I don't run if you rather leap, my statistics go up in weeks 
 And I go visit the nearest creek and I get busy on many MC, really ballistic 
 Anybody can see any assistance, everybody done see some persistence 
 Recognize I be really too vicious the permanent beast 
 And the demolition breaking up the streets, better partition, better dot your T 
 And I gon' mention how the far you see, putting my dick in the rap industry 
 Everybody bitching, getting mad at me, recognize Kendrick in the battery 
 And I'm charged up and the catastrophe is charged up and the audacity 
 Of y'all fucks never could hassle me and y'all luck, just ran out you'll see 
 (He dead), yup-yup, (Amen), I know 
 (He dead), for sure, (Amen), amen 
 Got me breathing with dragons 
 I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard 
 I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper 
 (He dead), yup-yup, (Amen), I know 
 (He dead), for sure, (Amen), amen"

 Ride to it, ride to it 'cause you never know 
 When a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it 
 Die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right 
 Be different, do different things 
 Don't do it like he did 'cause he ain't what you is 
 But we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point 
 To the meaning of life, what's my purpose? 
 Maybe this Earth is ain't a good place to be 
 How far is heaven? Let's see 
 Is it in the clouds like they said it would be? 
 I wonder when I die will he give me receipts? 
 I wonder will the eyes of the lord look at me? 
 Look at me, look at me, I'm a loser, I'm a winner 
 I'm good, I'm bad, I'm a Christian, I'm a sinner 
 I'm humble, I'm loud, I'm righteous, I'm a killer 
 What I'm doing, I'm saying that I'm human, now people just 
 Ride to it, ride to it, 'cause you never know 
 When a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it 
 Die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right 
 Be different, do different things 
 Don't do it like he did, 'cause he ain't what you is 
 But we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point 
 It go one, two, three, two in the front, one in the back seat, seat, seat 
 Seat, looking for a victim of an AK-47, hundred round each, each, each 
 But why must we retaliate? Is it human nature? 
 I don't know, I look for the answers later 
 Make a right, there they go 
 Sometimes gotta ride to it, ride to it 'cause you never know 
 When a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it 
 Die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right 
 Be different, do different things 
 Don't do it like he did 'cause he ain't what you is 
 But we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point 
 As I open this book and then burn up some of this reefer 
 My plan is to figure out the world and escape all my demons 
 I'm dying inside, I wonder if Zion inside the heavens 
 A condom, a Rollie, pain, a fat blunt and a Mac-11 
 That's all I see in my life and they tell me to make it right 
 But I'm right on the edge of Everest and I might jump tonight 
 Have you ever had known a saint that was taking sinner's advice? 
 Well it's probably you, am I right? If I'm wrong, you a fucking lie 
 When I lie on back and look at the ceiling, it's so appealing to pray 
 I wonder if I'm just a villain, dealing my morals away 
 Some people look at my face then tell me don't worry 'bout it 
 I give 'em back they deposit, no money, just total silence 
 I'm running, they say I'm wilding a young'n with lack of guidance 
 That's hundreds of us with problems, more money, more drugs and violence 
 Look at the soul of an out-of-control artist 
 That's dealing with life the hardest, that's on my life, but regardless I'mma 
 Ride to it, ride to it, 'cause you never know 
 When a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it 
 Die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right 
 Be different, do different things 
 Don't do it like he did, 'cause he ain't what you is 
 But we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point 
 BJ the Chicago Kid: 
 Yeah, life can please ya, but death can tease ya 
 On the day Niko had that seizure, I lost one of my biggest believers 
 Close deaths make you think about your life 
 Like if I had that same chance twice, what would I do different? 
 I'd tell her I loved her more, do more 
 But tease her 'bout crying on that picture 
 Now when I'm done recording, swear I let the beat bang in her name 
 Make her shake her head in heaven saying, they at it again 
 Make them clouds turn to speakers, don't take too much smoke 
 From the reefer, love being in the room with her peoples 
 Now my love life murking it, family having surgeries 
 Hate it that the truth that chose for they life to be under me 
 Lord, what kind of life is this? 
 Mama I just wanna sing

 You gotta risk everything""

 What's your life about? Enlighten me 
 Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet? 
 There's fire in the street, fire in the swisher 
 Fire in between the two legs of your lil' sister 
 Just get a sip of this elixir 
 Before they crop us out the picture 
 I've never seen a crop circle 
 But I've cops circle the block, I puff squares 
 But I swear one day I'ma stop, my nerves itch 
 On the brink of my career while my peers struggle for employment 
 Can you hear these screams? (Uncle Sam ain't no killing me) 
 One, two, three, four grams and a fifth of Hennessy 
 A bad bitch, fuck the penitentiary 
 (Sung by female) 
 Section 80's babies, blame Ronald Reagan 
 We raising hell 
 (Ab-Soul) 
 Lord forbid 
 The homie got wet, so we tryna soak it in 
 The president is black, but you can't vote for skin 
 You vote for the better man 
 Come to our show, you can see the diversity 
 Unify the people, they gon' peep it universally 
 We might not change the world, but we gon' manipulate it 
 I hope you participating 
 Aiyyo Dot, won't you let these cats know? 
 We knew we'd be here like back in '04 
 Started HiiiPoWeR because our generation needed a generator 
 And the system made to disintegrate us 
 And all we do is assist 'em 
 We're not victors, we're victims 
 The bigger picture isn't developed yet 
 Like, what if kids were celibate? 
 Or what is Tammy came across a real man 
 Who didn't play games like chil-dren? 
 My nigga cheated on his girlfriend 
 With his girlfriend's girlfriend, let the world end 
 And everybody tripping off twenty-twelve 
 And the extraterrestrial presence as well 
 (Odd Future's aight) but our future's not 
 That martial law shit drop, we gon' all get got 
 So keep that question mark on your face 
 Eat your fast-food, use your fluoride toothpaste 
 Hide your feelings from the public, work your lil' nine-to-five 
 Don't forget to pay your tithes, and thank God you alive (HiiiPoWeR)

 We focussed like the Hubble Telescope, 'Soul

 Is you gon' plead the fifth or sound the horn? 
 The time is now my child, come on 
 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 See a lot of y'all don't understand Kendrick Lamar 
 Because you wonder how I could talk about money, hoes, clothes, God and history 
 All in the same sentence 
 You know what all them things have in common? 
 Only half of the truth if you tell it 
 See I spent twenty-three years on this earth searching for answers 
 Till one day I realised I had to come up with my own 
 I'm not on the outside looking in, I'm not on inside looking out 
 I'm in the dead fucking centre looking around 
 You ever seen a newborn baby kill a grown man? 
 That's an analogy for the way the world make me react 
 My innocence been dead 
 So the next time I talk about money, hoes, clothes, God and history 
 All in the same sentence 
 Just know I meant it, and you felt it 
 Cause you too are searching for answers 
 I'm not the next pop star, I'm not the next socially aware rapper 
 I am a human motherfucking being over dope ass instrumentation 
 Kendrick Lamar 
 Now fuck 'em up Terrace 
 ('Soul!) 
 I watch this fire that we're gathered around 
 And see that it burns similar to the fire that burns inside you 
 Section 80, Section 80 babies 
 A generation of bliss and disobedience 
 No they can't control us, no they can't control you 
 No they can't control us, but we control each other 
 We build our own world 
 If you don't leave with nothing else tonight, you will leave with knowing yourself 
 You will leave knowing you represent something that's bigger than all of us 
 Or our family 
 Heart, honor and represent 
 This is you, this is me, and we are HiiiPoWeR"

 Malcolm X put a hex on my future, someone catch me 
 I'm falling victim to a revolutionary song, the Serengeti's clone 
 Back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone 
 You slipped your disc when I slid you my disc 
 You wanted to diss but jumped on my dick 
 Grown men never should bite they tongue 
 Unless you eating pussy that smell like it's a stale plum 
 I got my finger on the mothafuckin' pistol 
 Aiming it at a pig, Charlotte's web is going to miss you 
 My issue isn't televised, and you ain't gotta tell the wise 
 How to stay on beat, because our life's an instrumental 
 This is physical and mental, I won't sugar coat it 
 You'd die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it 
 And everything on TV just a figment of imagination 
 I don't want no plastic nation, dread that like a Haitian 
 While you mothafuckas waiting, I be off the slave ship

 Enough to drive a man insane, I need a license to kill 
 I'm standing on the field full of land mines 
 Doing the moonwalk, hoping I blow up in time

 Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party 
 Last time I checked, we was racing with Marcus Garvey 
 On the freeway to Africa till I wreck my Audi 
 And I want everybody to view my autopsy 
 So you can see exactly where the government had shot me 
 No conspiracy, my fate is inevitable 
 They play musical chairs once I'm on that pedestal 
 Frightening, so fucking frightening 
 Enough to drive a man insane, a woman insane 
 The reason Lauryn Hill don't sing, or Kurt Cobain 
 Loaded that clip and then said bang, the drama it bring is crazy 
 Product of the late 80's 
 Tryna stay above water, that's why we shun the navy 
 Pull your guns and play me, let's set it off 
 'Cause a riot, throw a Molotov, somebody told me them pirates had got lost 
 'Cause we been off them slave ships

 I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central 
 She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta 
 Ass came with a hump from the jump she was a camel 
 I want to ride like Arabians, push an '04 Mercedes-Benz 
 ""Hello my name is Kendrick,"" she said, ""No, you're handsome"" 
 Whispered in my ear, disappeared then found her dancing 
 Ciara had played in the background 
 The parade music we made had us all wearing shades now, cool 
 ""Where you stay?"" She said, ""Down the street from Dominguez High"" 
 Okay, I know that's borderline Compton or Paramount 
 ""Well is it Compton?"" ""No,"" she replied and quickly start batting her eyes 
 And strictly had wanted her thighs around me 
 Seventeen, with nothing but pussy stuck on my mental, my motive was rather sinful 
 ""What you trying to get into?"" 
 She didn't tell, just gave me her Nextel 
 Dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer and well 
 The summer had passed and now I'm liking her 
 Conversation we having probably enticing her 
 Who could imagine, maybe my actions would end up wifing her 
 Love or lust, regardless we'll fuck 'cause the trife in us 
 It's deep rooted, the music of being young and dumb 
 It's never muted, in fact it's much louder where I'm from 
 We know a lot 'bout each other, her mother was a crack addict 
 She live with her granny and her younger two brothers 
 Her favorite cousin Demetrius's irrepetible 
 Family history of gang banging did make me skeptical 
 But not enough to stop me from getting a nut 
 I wanna come over, what's up? That's what I told her soon as this episode 
 Of Martin go off, I'm trying to get off 
 I was in heat like a cactus, my tactics of being thirsty 
 Probably could hurt me, but fuck it I got some heart 
 Grab my mama's keys, hopped in the car, then oh boy 
 So now I'm down Rosecrans in a Caravan 
 Passing Alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump 
 I got enough to get me through the traffic jam 
 At least I hope 'cause my pockets broke as a promise man 
 I'm thinking bout that sex, thinking 'bout her thighs 
 Or maybe kissing on her neck, or maybe what positions next 
 Sent a picture of her titties blowing up my texts 
 I looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette 
 Enthused by the touch of a woman, she's a masseuse 
 And I'm a professional porn star when off the Goose 
 I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom 
 I'm hoping to get her loose like an Uncle Luke Anthem 
 I'm two blocks away, two-hundred and fifty feet 
 And six steps from where she stay, she waving me 'cross the street 
 I pulled up a smile on my face, and then I see 
 Two niggas, two black hoodies, I froze as my phone rang 
 Please leave your message for 323 
 Record your message after the tone

 Bitch don't kill my vibe, you ain't heard the coast like this in a long time 
 Don't you see that long line 
 And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth 
 Threes in the air I can see you are, in sync 
 Hide your feelings, hide your feelings now what you better do 
 I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal 
 Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe 
 Walk out the door and they scream it's alive 
 My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution 
 Talk too motherfucking much, I got my drink I got my music, I say

 Martin had a dream

 All my life I want money and power 
 Respect my mind or die from lead shower 
 I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower 
 So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours 
 Goddamn I feel amazing, damn I'm in the matrix 
 My mind is living on cloud nine and this nine is never on vacation 
 Start up that Maserati and vroom-vroom, I'm racing 
 Popping pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked 
 And I pray you niggas is hating, shooters go after Judas 
 Jesus Christ if I live life on my knees, ain't no need to do this 
 Park it in front of Lueders, next to that Church's Chicken 
 All you pussies is losers, all my niggas is winners, screaming 
 ""All my life I want money and power 
 Respect my mind or die from lead shower 
 I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower 
 So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours"" 
 Goddamn I got bitches, damn I got bitches (Okay, okay) 
 Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress 
 All my life I want money and power 
 Respect my mind or die from lead showers 
 I've got twenty-five lighters on my dresser, yes sir 
 Put fire to that ass, body cast on a stretcher 
 And her body got that ass that a ruler couldn't measure 
 And it make me cum fast but I never get embarrassed 
 And I recognize you have what I've been wanting since that record 
 That Adina Howard had pop it fast to impress her 
 She rolling, I'm holding my scrotum and posing 
 This voice here is golden, so fuck y'all, I goes in and 
 All my life I want money and power 
 Respect my mind or die from lead shower 
 I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower 
 So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours 
 Goddamn I got bitches, damn I got bitches 
 Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress 
 All my life I want money and power 
 Respect my mind or nigga it's go time 
 I roll in dough with a good grind and I run at ho with a baton 
 That's a relay race with a bouquet, they say, ""K, you going marry mines"" 
 Beeotch, no way, beeotch, no way, beeotch, no way, beeotch, okay 
 I'm never living life confined, it's a failure even if I'm blind 
 I can tell ya who what when where how to sell your game right on time 
 Beeotch, go play, beeotch, go play, beeotch, go play, beeotch 
 I look like OJ, killing everything from pussy to a mothafuckin' Hit-Boy beat 
 She pussy popping and I got options like an audible, I be 
 C-O-M-P-T-O-N, I win, then ball at your defeat 
 C-O-M-P-T-O-N, my city, mobbing in the street, yelling

50,Kendrick Lamar,hiphop,The Art Of Peer Pressure,"Everybody, everybody, everybody 
 Everybody sit your bitch ass down and listen to this true mothafuckin' story told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans, ya bitch 
 Smoking on the finest dope, aye aye aye aye 
 Drank until I can't no more, aye aye aye aye 
 Really I'm a sober soul but I'm with the homies right now 
 And we ain't asking for no favors 
 Rush a nigga quick then laugh about it later, aye aye aye aye 
 Really I'm a peacemaker but I'm with the homies right now 
 And mama used to say 
 ""One day, it's gon' burn you out 
 One day, it's gon' burn you out, out 
 One day, it's gon' burn you out 
 One day, it's gon' burn you"" 
 But I'm with the homies right now 
 Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota 
 A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, and orange soda 
 Janky stash box when the federales roll up 
 Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor 
 We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble 
 I hope the universe love you today 
 'Cause the energy we bringing sure to carry away 
 A flock of positive activists and fill the body with hate if it's necessary 
 Bumping Jeezy first album looking distracted 
 Speaking language only we know, you think is an accent 
 The windows roll down all I see is a hand pass it 
 Hotboxing like George Foreman grilling the masses 
 Of the working world, we pulled up on a bunch of working girls 
 And asked them what they working with, look at me 
 I got the blunt in my mouth 
 Usually I'm drug-free, but shit I'm with the homies 
 (Yeah nigga, we off a pill and Remy Red 
 Come through and bust ya head nigga) 
 Me and the homies 
 (Sag all the way to the liquor store 
 Where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more) 
 Me and the homies 
 (I ride for my motherfuckin' niggas 
 Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in) 
 Me and the homies 
 (Matter fact, I hop out that motherfucker and be like 
 Doo, doo, doo, doo 
 Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo) 
 It's 2:30 and the sun is beaming 
 Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screaming 
 Hungry for anything unhealthy and if nutrition can help me 
 I'll tell you to suck my dick then I'll continue eating 
 We speeding on the 405 passing Westchester 
 You know the light skin girls in all the little dresses, good Lord 
 They knew we weren't from 'round there 
 'Cause every time we down there, we pulling out the Boost Mobile SIM cards 
 Bougie bitches with no extensions 
 Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination 
 Before we sparked a conversation 
 We seen three niggas in colors we didn't like then started interrogating 
 I never was a gangbanger, I mean I was never stranger to the folk neither, I really doubt it 
 Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it 
 That's ironic 'cause I've never been violent, until I'm with the homies 
 (Just ridin', just ridin') 
 Me and the homies 
 (Bullshittin', actin' a fool) 
 Me and the homies 
 (Trippin', really trippin') 
 Me and the homies 
 (Just ridin', just ridin', just ridin') 
 Bragging 'bout the episode we just had 
 A shot of Hennessey didn't make me feel that bad 
 I'm usually a true firm believer of bad karma 
 Consequences from evil will make your past haunt you 
 We tryna conquer the city with disobedience 
 Quick to turn it up, even if we ain't got the CD in 
 But Jeezy still playing and our attitude is still ""Nigga, what is you saying"" 
 Pull in front of the house that we been camping out for like two months 
 The sun is going down as we take whatever we want 
 Ay, ay, nigga jackpot nigga, pop the safe 
 (Ay nigga, I think it's somebody in this room) 
 Wait, what? 
 (Nigga, it's somebody in this room) 
 I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo 
 DVDs, plasma screen TVs in the trunk 
 We made a right, then made a left, then made a right 
 Then made a left, we was just circling life 
 My mama called, ""Hello? What you doin'?"" Kicking it 
 I should've told her I'm probably 'bout to catch my first offense with the homies 
 But they made a right, they made a left then made a right, then another right 
 One lucky night with the homies 
 K. Dot, you faded, hood? 
 (Yeah we finally got that nigga faded 
 I think he hit the wrong blunt though) 
 Ooh, which one? 
 (Well which one he talking 'bout? 
 I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it) 
 I pray he ain't hit that 
 (Nah, that nigga straight 
 He ain't hit that one) 
 Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans 
 (Nigga I think we should push back to the city, fo' real doe nigga, for what?) 
 What that nigga, what's that Jeezy song say nigga? 
 ""Last time I checked I was the man on these streets"" 
 Yeah, yeah, that shit right there 
 I'm tryna be the nigga in the street 
 (There he go 
 Man you don't even know how the shit go) 
 Look, here's the plan luv 
 We gon' use the kickback as a alibi 
 Wait till the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission, drop K. Dot off at his mama van, at the park, 'cause I know he trying to fuck on Sherane tonight 
 (That's what he's not gon' do 
 Then we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10:30) 
 That's straight but we should meet up around 12, I'm tryna fuck on something too 
 (Nigga sit yo dumb ass back down, nigga you ain't doing shit tonight 
 Matter fact, nigga get in the mothafuckin' car 
 We finna get active)"

 From nine to five I know it's vacant, ya bish

 Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool 
 I fucked Sherane and went to tell my bros 
 Then Usher Raymond ""Let It Burn"" came on 
 Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish 
 Park the car then we start rhyming, ya bish 
 The only thing we had to free our mind 
 Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs 
 You looking like an easy come up, ya bish 
 A silver spoon I know you come from, ya bish 
 And that's a lifestyle that we never knew 
 Go at a reverend for the revenue

 Pick your poison, tell me what you doing

 But the one in front of the gun lives forever

 Two bullets in my Uncle Tony head 
 He said one day I'll be on tour, ya bish 
 That Louis Burger never be the same 
 A Louis belt will never ease that pain 
 But I'mma purchase when that day is jerking 
 Pull off at Church's with Pirellis skirting

 Hoping all of them offend you, ya bish 
 They say your hood is a pot of gold

 Santa Claus don't miss them stockings, liquor spillin', pistols popping 
 Baking soda YOLA whipping, ain't no turkey on Thanksgiving 
 My homeboy just domed a nigga, I just hope the Lord forgive him 
 Pots with cocaine residue, every day I'm hustlin' 
 What else is a thug to do when you eatin' cheese from the government? 
 Gotta provide for my daughter and 'em, get the fuck up out my way, bish 
 Got that drum and I got them bands, just like a parade, bish 
 Drop that work up in the bushes, hope them boys don't see my stash 
 If they do, tell the truth, this the last time you might see my ass 
 From the gardens where the grass ain't cut, them serpents lurking, blood 
 Bitches selling pussy, niggas selling drugs, but it's all good 
 Broken promises, steal your watch and tell you what time it is 
 Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a FootLocker is 
 In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees 
 Dreams of me getting shaded under a money tree

 Man I swear that she can get it 
 Say if you a bad bitch put your hands up high 
 Hands up high, hands up high 
 Tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood 
 I'm talking 'bout dark room, perfume, go, go 
 I recognize your fragrance, hold up, you ain't never gotta say shit, uh 
 And I know your taste is, a little bit hmm, high maintenance, uh 
 Everybody else basic, you live life on an everyday basis 
 With poetic justice, poetic justice 
 If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it? 
 I mean I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when 
 You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen 
 Better yet, where your friends and 'em? I really wanna know you all 
 I really wanna show you off, fuck that 
 Pour up plenty of champagne, cold nights when you curse this name 
 You called up your girlfriends and y'all curled in that little bitty Range 
 I heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party 
 Nigga don't approach her with that Atari 
 Nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry 
 They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell 
 But I could never right my wrongs 'less I write it down for real, PS 
 You can get it, you can get it 
 You can get it, you can get it 
 And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want 
 Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

 Drake: 
 I really hope you play this, 'cause old girl you test my patience 
 With all these seductive photographs and all these one off vacations 
 You've been taking clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense 
 Young East African girl, you too busy fucking with your other man 
 I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane 
 Take you and your mama to the motherland, I could do it 
 Maybe one day when you figure out you're gonna need someone 
 When you figure out it's all right here in the city and you don't run from where we come from 
 That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice 
 You were so new to this life but goddamn you got adjusted 
 I mean I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex 
 Your natural hair and your soft skin, and your big ass in that sundress, ooh 
 Good God, what you doing that walk for? 
 When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more 
 And they say communication save relations, I can tell 
 But I can never right my wrongs unless I write 'em down for real, PS

 You can get it, you can get it 
 And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want 
 Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright 
 Every time I write these words, they become a taboo 
 Making sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true 
 Living my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof 
 I'm talking poetic justice, poetic justice 
 If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it? 
 I mean you need to hear this, love is not just a verb 
 It's you looking in the mirror, love is not just a verb 
 It's you looking for it, maybe, call me crazy, we can both be insane 
 A fatal attraction is common and what we have common is pain 
 I mean you need to hear this, love is not just a verb 
 And I can see power steering, sex drive when you swerve 
 I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it, uh-huh 
 That's your heartbeat, it either caught me or it called me, uh-huh 
 Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines 
 Sincerely, yours truly and right before you go blind, PS 
 You can get it, you can get it 
 You can get it, you can get it

 Yo I don't care who this nigga over here for, if he don't tell where he come, it's a wrap, I'm sorry

 I'mma tell you where I'm from, okay? 
 You gon' tell me where you from, okay? 
 Or where your grandma stay, where your mama stay, or where your daddy stay, okay?)

 Get out the car before I snatch you out that motherfucker homie)"

 Kendrick Lamar: 
 Look inside these walls and you see I'm having withdrawals 
 Of a prisoner on his way trapped inside your desire 
 To fire bullets that stray, track attire just tell you 
 I'm tired and ran away, I should ask a choir 
 What do you require to sing a song that acquire me to have faith 
 As the record spin I should pray for the record I recognize 
 That I'm easily prey, I got ate alive yesterday 
 I got animosity building, it's probably big as a building 
 Me jumping off of the roof is me just playing it safe 
 But what am I supposed to do when the topic is red or blue 
 And you understand that I ain't, but know I'm accustomed to 
 Just a couple that look for trouble and live in the street with rank 
 No better picture to paint than me walking from bible study 
 And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face 
 From a function that tooken place, they was wondering if I bang 
 Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks 
 I don't mind cause one day you'll respect, the good kid, m.A.A.d. city

 All I see is strobe lights, blinding me in my hindsight 
 Finding me by myself, promise me you can help 
 In all honesty I got time to be copacetic until 
 You had finally made decision to hold me against my will 
 It was like a head on collision that folded me standing still 
 I can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the bill 
 Every time you clock in the morning, I feel you just want to kill 
 All my innocence while ignoring my purpose to persevere as a better person 
 I know you heard this and probably in fear 
 But what am I supposed to do with the blinking of red and blue 
 Flash from the top of your roof and your dog has to say woof 
 And you ask, ""Lift up your shirt,"" 'cause you wonder if a tattoo 
 Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through 
 Gang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile 
 I heard them chatter, ""He's probably young but I know that he's down"" 
 Step on his neck as hard as your bulletproof vest 
 He don't mind, he know we'll never respect, the good kid, m.A.A.d. city

 All I see in this room, twenty's, Xannies and these 'shrooms 
 Grown-up candy for pain, can we live in a sane society 
 It's entirely stressful upon my brain 
 You hired me as a victim, I quietly hope for change 
 When violence is the rhythm, inspired me to obtain 
 The silence in this room with 20's, Xannies and 'shrooms 
 Some grown-up candy I lost it, I feel it's nothing to lose 
 The streets sure to release the worst side of my best 
 Don't mind, 'cause now you ever in debt to good kid, m.A.A.d. city

 Man down, where you from, nigga? 
 Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga? 
 Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga? 
 This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga 
 Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane 
 This is not a rap on how I'm slinging crack or move cocaine 
 This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain 
 Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighing on your brain 
 It was Me, L Boogs and Yan Yan, YG, Lucky ride down Rosecrans 
 It got ugly, waving your hand out the window, check yourself, uh 
 Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance 
 With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed 
 Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out 
 At the same burger stand where hang out 
 Now this is not a tape recorder saying that he did it 
 But ever since that day, I was looking at him different 
 That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine 
 Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime 
 Pack a van with four guns at a time, with the sliding door, fuck is up? 
 Fuck you shooting for if you ain't walking up, you fucking punk? 
 Picking up the fucking pump, picking off you suckers 
 Suck a dick or die or sucker punch, a wall of bullets coming from 
 AK's, AR's, ""Aye y'all, duck"" 
 That's what mama said when we was eating the free lunch 
 Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose 
 You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck your truce 
 Now crawl your head in that noose, you wind up dead on the news 
 Ain't no peace treaty, just pieces BG's up to pre-approve 
 Bodies on top of bodies, IV's on top of IV's 
 Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys 
 When you hop on that trolley, make sure your colors correct 
 Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be calling your mother collect 
 They say the governor collect, all of our taxes except 
 When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat 
 You moving backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a tec 
 Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess, m.A.A.d city 
 Man down, where you from, nigga? 
 Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga? 
 Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?

 Kendrick Lamar: 
 Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad 
 Sleeping in the living room in my mama's pad 
 Reality struck I seen the white car crash 
 Hit the light pole two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed 
 My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him 
 Security guard for a month and ended up leaving 
 In fact I got fired 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends 
 To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in 
 Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up 
 Cocaine laced in marijuana 
 And they wonder why I rarely smoke now 
 Imagine if your first blunt had you foaming at the mouth 
 I was straight tweaking the next weekend, we broke even 
 I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleeding 
 You know the reasons but still won't ever know my life 
 Kendrick AKA Compton's human sacrifice 
 MC Eiht: 
 G-yeah 
 Cocaine, weed 
 Niggas been mixing shit since the eighties, loc 
 Sherm sticks, butt nakeds 
 Dip, make a nigga flip 
 Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit 
 One time's crooked and shit 
 Block a nigga in 
 Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton 
 I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah, that's cool 
 The hood took me under so I follow the rules 
 But yeah that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang 
 And niggas that rep colors is doing the same thang 
 Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me 
 A couple drive-by's in the hood lately 
 Couple of IV's with the fucking spray can 
 Shots in the crowd then everybody ran 
 Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave 
 Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave 
 Mount up, regulators in the whip 
 Down the boulevard with the pistol grip 
 Trip, we in the hood still 
 So loc, grab a strap 'cause yeah, it's so real 
 Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand 
 And a bird and ten grands where a motherfucker stand

 Or see me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street 
 With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat 
 If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat? 
 Would you say my intelligence now is great relief? 
 And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep 
 With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor, instead of boy with a chopper 
 That hold the cul-de-sac hostage, kill 'em all if they gossip 
 The Children of the Corn, they vandalizing 
 The option of living a lie, drown their body with toxins 
 Constantly drinking and drive, hit the powder then watch this flame 
 That arrive in his eye, listen coward, the concept is aim 
 And they bang it and slide out that bitch with deposits 
 A price on his head, the tithes probably go to the projects 
 I live inside the belly of the rough 
 Compton, USA made Me an Angel on Angel Dust, what 
 M.A.A.d city 
 Compton 
 Nigga, pass Dot the bottle, damn 
 You ain't the one that got fucked up, what you holding it for? 
 Niggas always acting unsensitive and shit 
 (Nigga, that ain't no word) 
 Nigga, shut up 
 Hey, Dot, you good, my nigga? 
 Don't even trip, just lay back and drink that"

 Sit down, drank, stand up, drank 
 Pass out, drank, wake up, drank 
 Faded, drank, faded, drank 
 Now I done grew up 
 Round some people living their life in bottles 
 Granddaddy had the golden flask 
 Back stroke every day in Chicago 
 Some people like the way it feels 
 Some people wanna kill their sorrows 
 Some people wanna fit in with the popular 
 That was my problem 
 I was in the dark room 
 Loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon 
 That I'mma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup 
 I see the crowd mood 
 Changing by the minute and the record on repeat 
 Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me: 
 Nigga why you babysittin only two or three shots? 
 I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch 
 First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it 
 Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it 
 I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock 
 All the girls wanna play Baywatch 
 I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it 
 Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it

 Pass out, drank, wake up, drank 
 Faded, drank, faded, drank 
 Okay, now open your mind up and listen to me, Kendrick 
 I'm your conscience, if you do not hear me 
 Then you will be history, Kendrick 
 I know that you're nauseous right now 
 And I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick 
 If I take another one down 
 I'mma drown in some poison abusin' my limit 
 I think that I'm feelin' the vibe 
 I see the love in her eyes, I see the feelin' 
 The freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrive 
 This how you capitalize 
 This is parental advice 
 Then apparently, I'm over influenced by what you are doin' 
 I thought I was doin' the most then someone said to me 
 Nigga why you babysittin only two or three shots? 
 I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch 
 First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it 
 Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it

 Aw man, what is she taking? 
 Where is she taking 
 All I, all I, all I, all I 
 All I have in life is my new appetite for failure 
 And I got Hunger pain that grow insane 
 Tell me do that sound familiar? 
 If it do then you're like me 
 Making excuse that your relief 
 Is in the bottom of the bottle 
 And the greenest indo leaf 
 As the window open 
 I release everything that corrode inside of me 
 I see you joking, why you laugh? 
 Don't you feel bad? 
 I probably sleep and never ever wake up 
 Never ever wake up, never ever wake up 
 In God I trust 
 But just when I thought I had enough"
56,Kendrick Lamar,hiphop,"Sing About Me, I'm Dying Of Thirst","When the lights shut off 
 And it's my turn to settle down 
 My main concern 
 Promise that you will sing about me

 I said when the lights shut off 
 And it's my turn to settle down 
 My main concern 
 Promise that you will sing about me 
 Promise that you will sing about me 
 I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you 
 In case I'm not here tomorrow, I'm hoping that I can borrow 
 A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important 
 My mind is really distorted, I find nothing but trouble in my life 
 I'm fortunate you believe in a dream 
 This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine 
 And last night was just another distraction or a reaction 
 Of what we consider madness, I know exactly what happened 
 You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help 
 Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel 
 Like everything was all right and a fight he tried to put up 
 But the type of bullet that stuck had went against his will 
 As blood spilled on your hands, my plans rather vindictive 
 Everybody's a victim in my eyes 
 When I ride, it's a murderous rhythm and outside became pitch black 
 A demon glued to my back whispering, ""Get 'em"" 
 I got 'em, and I ain't give a fuck 
 That same mentality that told my brother not to duck 
 In actuality, it's a trip how we trip off of colors 
 I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover 
 The life that I knew as a young'n in pajamas and dun-ta-duns 
 When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs 
 Dumb niggas like me never prosper 
 Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well devoted 
 This piru shit been in me forever 
 So forever I'mma push it, wherever, whenever 
 And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did 
 Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big 
 And if I die before your album drop, I hope 
 Promise that you will sing about me 
 Promise that you will sing about me 
 I said when the lights shut off 
 And it's my turn to settle down 
 My main concern 
 Promise that you will sing about me 
 Promise that you will sing about me 
 You wrote a song about my sister on your tape 
 And called it ""Section.80,"" the message resembled ""Brenda's Got a Baby"" 
 What's crazy was, I was hearin about it 
 But doubted your ignorance how could you ever just put her on blast and shit 
 Judging her past and shit, well it's completely my future 
 Her nigga behind me right now asking for ass and shit 
 And I'mma need that 40 dollars even if I gotta 
 Fuck, suck and swallow in the parking lot 
 Gonzales Park, I'm followed by a married man, a father of three 
 My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinkling keys 
 Matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's 
 He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week 
 This is the life of another girl damaged by the system 
 These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em 
 See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em back 
 To where they used to be then I'll probably be in the denim 
 Of a family gene that show women how to be woman 
 Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin' 
 Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught 
 Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed 
 And I'm exhausted, but fuck that ""Sorry for your loss"" shit 
 My sister died in vain, but what point are you trying to gain 
 If you can't fit the pumps I walk in? 
 I'll wait 
 Your rebuttal a little too late 
 And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song 
 'Cause I don't need the attention bring enough of that on my own 
 And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great? 
 A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight 
 I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away 
 I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate 
 And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'mma get it or die trying 
 I'm eyeing every male gender with intentions of buying 
 You lying to these motherfuckers, talking about you can help 'em 
 With my story, you can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga 
 Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga 
 When the lights shut off 
 And it's my turn to settle down 
 My main concern

 I said when the lights shut off 
 And it's my turn to settle down 
 My main concern 
 Promise that you will sing about me 
 Promise that you will sing about me 
 Sometimes I look in a mirror and ask myself 
 ""Am I really scared of passing away?"" If it's today, I hope I hear a 
 Cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon 
 With the holy ghost till it drown in the blood of Jesus 
 I wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline 
 Reeking the scent of a reaper, ensuring that my allegiance 
 With the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed 
 May the wound help my mother be blessed for many moons 
 I suffer a lot, and every day the glass mirror 
 Get tougher to watch, I tie my stomach in knots 
 And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death 
 My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats 
 That can come about, 'cause the tongue is mighty powerful 
 And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch 
 Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death 
 Really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'mma rest 
 And you're right, your brother was a brother to me 
 And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me 
 In a direction to speak of something that's realer than the TV screen 
 By any means, wasn't trying to offend or come between 
 Her personal life, I was like, ""It need to be told"" 
 Cursing the life of twenty generations after her soul 
 Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continued rappin' 
 Or steady being distracted by money drugs and four 
 Fives, I count lives all on these songs 
 Look at the weak and cry, pray one day, you'll be strong 
 Fighting for your rights even when you're wrong 
 And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone 
 Am I worth it? Did I put enough work in? 
 Promise that you will sing about me 
 Promise that you will sing about me 
 I said when the lights shut off 
 And it's my turn to settle down 
 My main concern 
 Promise that you will sing about me 
 Promise that you will sing about me 
 Promise that you'll sing about me forever 
 Promise that you'll sing about me for ooh 
 Promise that you'll sing about me forever 
 Promise that you'll sing about me for ooh 
 Promise that you'll sing about me forever 
 Promise that you'll sing about me for ooh 
 Nigga, the homie's brother 
 Nigga, right here, he gone, my nigga, he gone 
 (Nigga, they just killed the homie's brother, my nigga 
 We right here on the block, my nigga) 
 Al, all right, nigga, nigga just come, all right, all right, just call me back, man, just call me back 
 Argh 
 (So what we gon' do, my niggas? What we gon' do? 
 Bro, we can go back right now, my nigga 
 Like, nigga, I don't give a fuck, my nigga, we can go back right now) 
 Fuck! I'm tired of this shit! I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit 
 My brother, homie 
 Tired of running, tired of hunting 
 My own kind but retiring nothing 
 Tires are steady screeching, the driver is rubbing 
 Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't 
 Dying of thirst, dying of thirst, dying of thirst? 
 Dope on the corner, look at the coroner 
 Daughter is dead, mother is mournin' her 
 Strayed bullets, AK bullets 
 Resuscitation was waiting patiently but they couldn't 
 Bring her back, who got the footage? 
 Channel 9, cameras is looking 
 It's hard to channel your energy when you know you're crooked 
 Banana clip, split his banana pudding 
 I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding 
 I know I'm good at 
 Dying of thirst, dying of thirst, dying of thirst 
 How many sins? I'm running out 
 How many sins? I lost count 
 Dreams of balling like Spalding but only shotty bounce 
 The reaper calling, I'm cottonmouth 
 Money is power (Money is power), yours is ours (Yours is ours) 
 Lay with a snitch, die with a coward 
 Hope we get rich, hope we can tower 
 Over the city with vanity with the music louder 
 The same song, a black flower 
 I'll show you how to 
 Dye your thirst, dye your thirst, dye your thirst 
 What are we doing? Who are we fooling? 
 Hell is hot, fire is proven 
 To burn for eternity, return of the student 
 That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it 
 Tired of running, choirs is hummin' 
 Tell us to visit, we lying 'bout comin' 
 Now back to business, loading the guns in 
 Back of the Buick, your hood is feuding, the beef is bubblin' 
 It's no discussion, hereditary 
 All of my cousins 
 Dying of thirst, dying of thirst, dying of thirst 
 Too many sins, I'm running out 
 Somebody send me a well for the drought 
 See, all I know, is taking notes 
 On taking this life for granted, granted, if he provoke 
 My best days, are stress days 
 Lord, forgive me for all my sins for I not know 
 My best days, are stress days 
 Say ""Fuck the world,"" my sex slave 
 Money, pussy and greed, what's my next crave? 
 Whatever it is, know it's my next grave 
 Tired of running, tired of running 
 Tired of tumbling, tired of running 
 Tired of tumbling 
 Back once my momma say 
 ""See a pastor, give me a promise 
 What if today was the rapture, and you completely tarnished 
 The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest 
 You dying of thirst, you dying of thirst 
 So hop in that water, and pray that it works"" 
 (Fuck, I'm tired of this shit 
 I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit 
 That's my brother, homie) 
 Young man, come talk to me 
 Is that what I think that is? 
 I know that's not what I think that is 
 Why are you so angry? See you young men are dying of thirst 
 Do you know what that means? That means you need water, holy water 
 You need to be baptized, with the spirit of The Lord 
 Do you want to receive God as your personal savior? Okay, repeat after me 
 Lord God, I come to you a sinner (Lord God, I come to you a sinner) 
 And I humbly repent for my sins (And I humbly repent for my sins) 
 I believe that Jesus is Lord (I believe Jesus is Lord) 
 I believe you raised him from the dead (I believe you raised him from the dead) 
 I would ask that Jesus come into my life (I would ask that Jesus come in my life) 
 And to be my Lord and Savior (And to be my Lord and Savior) 
 I receive Jesus to take control of my life (I receive Jesus to take control of my life) 
 And that I may live with him from this day forward (And that I may live with him from this day forward) 
 Thank you Lord Jesus for saving me with your precious blood (Thank you Lord Jesus for saving me with your precious blood) 
 In Jesus name, amen (In Jesus name, amen) 
 All right now, remember this day, the start of a new life 
 Your real life"

 Kendrick Lamar: 
 I promise that I know you very well 
 Your eyes never lie, even if they tell 
 Sweet lullabies that come with a smell 
 Of a dozen roses flipping down the green hill 
 You're living in a world that come with plan B 
 'Cause plan A never relay a guarantee 
 And plan C never could say just what it was 
 And your plans only can pan around love 
 You love him, you love them, you love her 
 You love so much, you love when love hurts 
 You love red bottom and gold that say, ""Queen"" 
 You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean 
 You love French tip and trip that pay for 
 You love bank slip that tell you we paid more 
 You love a good hand whenever the card dealt 
 But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?

 Kendrick Lamar: 
 I promise that I know you very well 
 Your eyes never lie, even if they fell 
 Out the sky and your optics turn stale 
 Where they mold that's green, I can see you fit the bill 
 Of living in a world that come with plan B 
 'Cause plan A only can make another mistake 
 And you can't see success coming from plan C 
 When it all breaks, you'll still say you're lovely 
 And love them and love when you love her 
 You love so much, you love when love hurts 
 You love fast cars and dead presidents old 
 You love fast women, you love keepin' control 
 Of everything that you love, you love beef 
 You love streets, you love running, ducking police 
 You love your hood, might even love it to death

 The reason why I know you very well 
 'Cause we have the same eyes, can't you tell? 
 The days I tried to cover up and conceal 
 My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal 
 When living in a world that come with plan B 
 A scapegoat 'cause plan A don't come free 
 And plan C just an excuse like because 
 Or the word ""but,"" but what if I got love? 
 I love them, I love when I love her 
 I love so much, I love when love hurts 
 I love first verse 'cause you're the girl I attract 
 I love second verse 'cause you're the homie that pack 
 Burner like a stove top, that love cooking from scratch 
 I love what the both of you have to offer 
 In fact, I love it so much, I don't love anything else 
 But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself 
 To the point I should hate everything I do love? 
 Should I hate living my life inside the club? 
 Should I hate her for watching me for that reason? 
 Should I hate him for telling me that I'm seizin'? 
 Should I hate them for telling me, ""Ball out""? 
 Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about 
 Hating all money, power, respect in my will 
 Or hating the fact none of that shit make me real? 
 Kenny, I ain't trippin' off them dominoes anymore 
 Just calling, sorry to hear what happened to your homeboy, but don't learn the hard way like I did, homie

 When I'm back in the back of my city, back in the 'bach 
 With a batch of them banging Dre Beats with me, look where I'm at 
 It's the murder cap' and I'm captain at birthing this gangsta rap

 Some, three W's only for a three day run, bitch 
 Take them motherfuckin' panties off, you ain't no... nun, shit 
 I be living in the sky every time I ride by them hoes 
 Ribbon in the sky on the radio cause Stevie know I control 
 Let it breathe, I control, California living till I am old 
 You want to be one, to peak on the chart 
 So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts 
 She in the coupe, she in the Neon 'cause she on the BS before we can start 
 Fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga, let 'em know the priority order me 
 Hennessey and for my niggas OG Killa, call it Jason Voorhees 
 Boy he's on his job, boy he sure be having the marks on they mark 
 Pretty bitches and tire marks, let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts 
 Let 'em reveal how much it cost for this life controlling my vice 
 No way hell no, uh uh, if I'm wrong I don't wanna be right 
 You want to be one, to peak on the chart 
 So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts 
 Women, weed, weather, it's not my fault 
 That it's 82 degrees and my top peeled off 
 You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss 
 New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York 
 Texas I be screwed up, Chi town I be really pimping 
 But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living 
 Women, weed and weather 
 (They come for) women, weed and weather 
 For the women, weed and weather 
 (From all around the world for the) women, weed and weather 
 Got that women, weed and weather 
 Don't it sound clever, come and play 
 What more can I say? Welcome to LA 
 Known for that homegrown where I come from 
 Smoke one, palm trees, double D's got 'em topless in the sun 
 I shall proceed, that's me, muthafuck your opinion 
 How many ways am I killing 'em? Shit, right around a billion 
 We on it, that mean we living for the moment 
 That mean she'll fuck till the morning, time and I got time 
 And I know that I'm in a position of controlling, anything, I by that ocean 
 I'm a boss I'll buy that ocean, ain't nobody fucking with this 
 They want that shit, they often feind, I give it to 'em, but in between 
 My time, I gotta tie shoestrings, life's a trip when you want these things 
 I often slip and then I lean toward three W's in life 
 You know blow job need an application, eating pussy make appetite 
 And yeah my type, I like 'em brown, just like my drink, the fuck you think 
 I don't fuck with no hand me downs, see if you fuck then it's after me 
 You know how much I'mma make it work? You know her trust livin' in her purse 
 When you discussed your love for lust, just make sure you visit here first, Cali 
 You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss 
 New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York 
 Texas I be screwed up, Chi town I be really pimping 
 But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living 
 Women, weed and weather

 So I'm saying ""What up what up. Nigga you made it."" 
 So I'm saying ""What up what up. Nigga I hate it."" 
 So I'm saying ""What up what up. Nigga I hate it."" 
 Frustrated and I'm riding down the back streets 
 Making my conscious ask me 
 ""Would I survive to make it up out this hole in time?"" 
 Black boy fly

 Black boy fly 
 I used to be jealous of Aaron Afflalo 
 I used to be jealous of Aaron Afflalo 
 He was the one to follow 
 He was the only leader foreseeing brighter tomorrows 
 He would live in the gym 
 We was living in sorrow 
 Total envy of him 
 He made a dream become a reality 
 Actually making it possible to swim 
 His way out of Compton with further more to accomplish 
 Graduate with honors, a sponsor of basketball scholars 
 It's 2004 and I'm watching him score 30 
 Remember vividly how them victory points had hurt me 
 Cause every basket was a reaction or a reminder 
 That we was just moving backwards 
 The bungalow where you find us 
 The art of us ditching classes heading nowhere fast 
 Stick my head inside the study hall, he focused on math 
 Determination ambition, plus dedication and wisdom 
 Qualities he was given was the shit we didn't have 
 Dug inside of his book bag and Coach Palmer asked for his finals 
 He had his back like a spinal meanwhile 
 We singing the same old song spinning the vinyl 
 11 graders gone wrong 
 He focused on the NBA we focused on some Patron 
 Now watch that black boy fly 
 Black boy fly 
 Watch that black boy fly 
 Black boy fly 
 Watch that black boy fly 
 Black boy fly 
 Watch that black boy fly 
 Black boy 
 I used to jealous of Jayceon 
 I used to jealous of Jayceon - Taylor when I was young 
 Taylor made a career out of music from writing songs 
 A Buick had driven past bumping him when I mowed the lawn 
 Money laundering hustling, homies pondering up against 
 Schemes to make a million even if doing you harm 
 War's the case and just in case you wasn't alarmed 
 The city had fought with firearms and many had died before dawn 
 Its 2004 and I'm hearing the people roar 
 For the name of The Game they line in front of the store 
 Swap meets selling our mixtapes I'm like oh shit, wait 
 Don't wanna be another nigga stuck regretting mistakes 
 Mixed feelings was my opinion I was defending my insecurities 
 Chillin' my conscience next to a villain 
 Compton made you believe success wasn't real 
 Be honest, none of us knew of a record deal 
 So as I peel through these lottery tickets 
 I see a Harley Davidson truck visit the same plaza we shopped 
 A tall nigga hopped out with Jordans and a white tank top 
 He was top of the rap game, we was the top of the block 
 So watch that black boy fly 
 Black boy fly 
 Watch that black boy fly 
 Black boy fly 
 Watch that black boy fly 
 Black boy fly 
 Watch that black boy fly 
 Black boy 
 My mama didn't raise me up to be jealous-hearted 
 Like most of the winners call it 
 Regardless of where you stay, hold your head and continue marching 
 That's what she said but in my head I wanted to be like Jordan 
 A Boy touring the country with money from mic recording 
 The only way out the ghetto, you know the stereotype 
 Shooting hoops or live on the stereo like top 40 
 And shortly, I got discouraged 
 Like every time I walked to the corner had them guns bursting 
 Nigga, I was rehearsing in repetition the phrase 
 Only one in a million will ever see better days 
 Especially when the crime waves was bigger than tsunamis 
 Break your boogie boards to pieces you just a typical homy 
 All these niggas facetious and they all standing beside me 
 They all will buy me a chopper if any one of you try me 
 What am I to do when every neighborhood is an obstacle 
 When 2 niggas making it out had never sounded logical 
 3 niggas making it out, that's mission impossible 
 So I never believed the type of performance that I could do 
 I wasn't jealous 'cause of the talents they got 
 I was terrified they'll be the last black boys to fly... 
 Out of Compton 
 Thank God... 
 Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly"
61,Kendrick Lamar,hiphop,Now Or Never,"We on? 
 Aight 
 1,2,3, go! 
 Waking up in a dream 
 Sleepwalking on another big stage 
 You never heard peace till you hear people scream 
 Your name and your song, I'm so far away 
 From the place I used to be, struggling usually 
 Look at the newer me, fate pursuing me 
 I can feel the energy in the air 
 It feel like I'm supposed to be here 
 Everywhere I go I'm getting so much love 
 Fans, the stars, everyone 
 Sayin' how they can't wait for the LP 
 And I'm gonna blow 
 Feel so good in what you do 
 Helps somebody else get through 
 That's why I do the best I can 
 Because I know how blessed I am 
 I'm so high I can touch the sky 
 I know it's my time 
 And it's now or never 
 I'm so bright I light the night 
 And it feels so right ain't nothing better 
 A fool if I take it all for granted 
 A smart man if I keep my feet planted to the earth 
 'Cause the people that hurt can't understand it 
 You speakin' outlandish, I'm ashamed how to make it all work 
 Another planet, it's a short term role for me 
 I rec it's all for me, it's just mo with me 
 And you're here for you too here can re-persevere 
 Defenses, I yet feel relentless 
 Ambition with a clear vision 
 Takin' off, I ain't takin' off these pistons 
 I'm takin' off on the enemies, your distance 
 Came across me, how much it'd cost me to get you out my business? 
 I said a planet is a shortterm goal, no sky is the limit 
 I'm past that, now pass that 
 A word not one but 4 times 2 plus yours 
 I see myself performing at 
 Soldout shows where the room is packed 
 Sitting at the Grammys, winning 5 awards 
 See myself on big billboards 
 Climbing round the world would endorse me deals 
 Can't imagine how it feels 
 That's why I'm smiling every day 
 Cause my dream ain't far away 
 I'm so high I can touch the sky 
 I know it's my time 
 And it's now or never 
 I'm so bright I light the night 
 And it feels so right ain't nothing better 
 You're looking at me and tell me I'm blessed 
 Calculating my steps, my heart, my breath 
 Breath lungs of a victory and vividly you see me when I'm at my best, my worse 
 This verse is dedicated to the days that I slept with the curse 
 Research my paid dues, I'm reimbursed 
 I burst in the crowd with a voice and a crown 
 I'm a king on a prowl and I see mama smile 
 And the vow I'mma take that I'll never break 
 You can break bread with me now, we can all take a bow 
 On the edge of the pedestal and scream out loud 
 That we made it off the avenue, I walk then down in the darkness 
 I often sit back and get lost in the rap that I root 
 When you told me that it spoke to your soul 
 I was talkin' to you, I was walkin' it through 
 Heavy ghetto, tail of success, hello 
 And I'm so happy I cry 
 'Cause I can't believe 
 All the things I ever wanted 
 Are finally happening for me 
 And it's so surreal 
 That I almost feel 
 That any minute I can wake up 
 From this fantasy 
 When you play so hard 
 And you've come so far 
 And you go, that is the time for you to leave your more 
 And I'm gonna do it 
 Watch me 
 I'm so high I can touch the sky 
 I know it's my time 
 And it's now or never 
 I'm so bright I light the night 
 And it feels so right ain't nothing better 
 I'm so high I can touch the sky 
 I know it's my time 
 And it's now or never 
 I'm so bright I light the night 
 And it feels so right ain't nothing better"

 Not too much, I hustle up the rest myself 
 K Dot wrote me saying Marcus got killed

 Mama take this motherfucking block off 
 That's the date the state will take the blocks off 
 Pulled up, and they put me in them cop cars 
 Please believe me, This ain't easy by far 
 You forgot you're talking to your only son 
 Remember when you put me in that relay run 
 I was racing, chasing dreams to be the best 
 You had told me that the very day I won 
 All I need is you to give me some support 
 Investigation saying that the same report 
 From a witness just might testify in court 
 DA say I take a deal, or take a loss 
 I ain't built for all them god damn numbers 
 God's will, say a prayer for me mama 
 If you can't, then open up the phone lines 
 Mama just get back at me this last time 
 Men lie, Women lie 
 Men lie, Women lie 
 Men lie, Women lie 
 Men lie, Women lie 
 Look at all the bullshit I been through 
 If I take you home, will you tell the truth 
 Look at all the bullshit I been through 
 If I take you home, will you tell the truth 
 Now I tell if I stress take the block off 
 That's the day the state had take them locks off 
 I could only help but do so much 
 Bettering yourself, your own crutch 
 Look at your reflection tell me who you see 
 Who is your protection, G-O-D 
 No it's not neglection, I have just accepted 
 Your fate and what its gon' be 
 Remember all the nights that I cried 
 Thinking that my only son just died 
 Peeking through the window, Kicking through the door 
 It's you they looking for, Raid outside 
 Rather see you locked up than dead 
 Only you would say that I'm selfish 
 So before I take the stand, and put this bible in my hand 
 Son, let me say this 
 Men lie, Women lie 
 Men lie, Women lie 
 Men lie, Women lie 
 Men lie, Women lie 
 Look at all the bullshit I been through 
 If I take you home, will you tell the truth 
 Look at all the bullshit I been through

 Granddaddy had the golden flask 
 Backstroke every day in Chicago 
 Some people like the way it feels 
 Some people wanna kill their sorrows 
 Some people wanna fit in with the popular 
 That was my problem 
 I was in a dark room, loud tunes 
 Looking to make a vow soon 
 That I'mma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup 
 I see the crowd mood 
 Changin' by the minute 
 And the record on repeat 
 Took a sip then another sip 
 Then somebody said to me 
 ""Nigga, why you babysitting only two or three shots? 
 I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch 
 First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it

 I've been waiting on this since dr. dre and pac 
 Was on rosecrans in that burgerstand at '95 
 People staring at 'em in amazement 
 Reservation at the days inn 
 We was living out a hotel at the time 
 Breakfast, lunch and dinner chicken from kentucky fried 
 Mama babysitting section 8 vouchers the move 
 When nothing else to lose but a burger flip and job 
 Close my eyes inside the swap meet and imagine this, imagine 
 Gold ballroom, ak-47 dancing 
 Howling at the moon, what's a pack of hungry babies? 
 Hope you feed 'em soon, bite your back, you die of rabies 
 Everyday we pray to eat at the table at sizzlers 
 But never make the visit, if better days was on its way 
 Then they make the decision, to make the wrong turn 
 So for now we heat this skillet so this canned food can burn 
 (Oh I remember that, it was the ravioli with the hot sauce in it, right?) 
 And all the ghetto children in the world say, ""that's my car"" 
 All the ghetto boys say, ""that's my car"" 
 All the ghetto girls say, ""that's my car"" 
 When we grow up, when we grow up 
 All the ghetto children in the world say, ""that's my car"" 
 All the ghetto boys say, ""that's my car"" 
 All the ghetto girls say, ""that's my car"" 
 When we grow up, when we grow up 
 (Nigga you remember the smoke and the burning buildings and shit?) 
 Couples stolen TV's and a seat belt for my safety 
 Played the passenger I think it's five years after eighty 
 Seven, do the math, ' 92 don't you be lazy 
 Looking out the window, notice all the essentials 
 Of a block party that stop for a second, then it rekindle 
 Like a flame from a trick candle, everybody got dental 
 Insurance 'cause we 'bout to floss, you get that couch I sent you? 
 I heard that from a block away, probably had a credentials 
 Of a scholar but shit not today, them dayton spokes was his to take 
 Refrigerators, barbecue pits, and jordan kicks 
 They did invasions while helicopters recorded it 
 Hello mi-mister miyagi, I want them ten woo-woofers 
 Say that you got me if not, I'll dig in your drawer for it 
 The swap meet was the bull's-eye like tauruses 
 Murder was the melody you should know what the chorus is 
 ""Papa you really telling me we can just get some more of it 
 If we run out?"" he said, ""lil nigga today the poor is rich"" 
 Don't tell your mom that you seen a molotov bomb 
 If she ask just know you have to lie and son don't forget 
 Bitches ain't shit, hoes ain't neither 
 Niggas gon snitch, watch the company you keeping 
 And one day you'll put money in the ghetto when you got it

 But a rapper with a ghost writer? What the fuck happened? 
 (Oh no) I swore I wouldn't tell 
 But most of y'all sharing bars like you got the bottom bunk in a two man cell (A two man cell?) 
 Something's in the water (Something's in the water) 
 And if I gotta brown nose for some gold 
 Then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller, oh yeah 
 Bitch where you when I was walkin'? 
 Now I run the game got the whole world talkin', King Kunta 
 Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, King Kunta 
 Black man taking no losses, oh yeah 
 Bitch where you when I was walkin'? 
 Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin', King Kunta 
 Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, King Kunta 
 When you got the yams (What's the yams?) 
 The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor 
 Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires 
 24/7, 365 days times two 
 I was contemplatin' gettin' on stage just to go back to the hood, see my enemy and say, oh yeah 
 ""Bitch where you when I was walkin'? 
 Now I run the game got the whole world talkin', King Kunta 
 Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, King Kunta 
 Black man taking no losses, oh yeah

 (You goat mouth mammy fucker) 
 Kendrick Lamar: 
 I was gonna kill a couple rappers but they did it to themselves 
 Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help 
 This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail 
 And if I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left 
 Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin' ""Compton"" 
 I should probably run for Mayor when I'm done, to be honest 
 And I put that on my Mama and my baby boo too 
 Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo woo 
 Ah yeah, fuck the judge, I made it past twenty-five and there I was 
 A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him 
 Life ain't shit but a fat vagina, screamin', ""Annie are you okay? Annie are you okay?"" 
 Limo tinted with the gold plates 
 Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast 
 From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king, oh yeah 
 Kendrick Lamar and Whitney Alford: 
 Bitch where was you when I was 
 (By the time you hear the next pop, the funk shall be within you) 
 Now I run the game got the whole world talkin', King Kunta 
 Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, (King) Kunta 
 Black man taking no losses, oh yeah 
 Bitch where was you when I was walkin' 
 Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin', King Kunta

68,Kendrick Lamar,hiphop,Institutionalized,"What money got to do with it 
 When I don't know the full definition of a rap image? 
 I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it 
 Institutionalized, I keep runnin' back for a visit, hol' up 
 Get it back 
 I said I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it 
 Institutionalized, I could still kill me a nigga, so what? 
 If I was the president 
 I'd pay my mama's rent 
 Free my homies and them 
 Bulletproof my Chevy doors 
 Lay in the White House and get high, Lord 
 Who ever thought? 
 Master, take the chains off me 
 Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom 
 Zoom, zoom, zoom 
 Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom 
 Zoom, zoom, zoom 
 Shit 
 Life can be like a box of chocolate 
 Quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious 
 Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it 
 Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive 
 I can just alleviate the rap industry politics 
 Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant 
 The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious 
 Me, scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges 
 Be all you can be, true, but the problem is 
 Dream only a dream if work don't follow it 
 Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this 
 I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal 
 K Dizzle will do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god 
 Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually you're never charged 
 But somethin' came over you once I took you to the fuckin' BET Awards 
 You lookin' at artists' like the harvests 
 So many Rollies around you and you want all of them 
 Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry 
 I should've listened when my grandmama said to me 
 ""Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga 
 Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy 
 Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga 
 Oh now, slow down"" 
 Once upon a time, in a city so divine 
 Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga 
 He was five foot something, God bless the kid 
 Took his homie to the show and this is what they said 
 ""Fuck am I 'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks? 
 The constant big money talk 'bout the mansion and foreign whips 
 The private jets and passport, presidential glass floor 
 Gold bottles, gold models, sniffin' up the ass for 
 Instagram flicks, suck a dick, fuck is this? 
 One more suck away from wavin' flashy wrist 
 My defense mechanism tell me to get him 
 Quickly because he got it 
 It's a recession, then why the fuck he a King of Diamonds? 
 No more livin' poor, meet my .44 
 When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor 
 Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers 
 But it's gon' take a lot for this pistol go cold turkey 
 Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay 
 But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA 
 Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor? 
 Well that's me at these awards"" 
 I guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy, she said 
 ""Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga 
 Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy 
 Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga 
 Oh now, slow down"" 
 Once upon a time, in a city so divine 
 Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga 
 He was five foot something, dazed and confused 
 Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse 
 You can take your boy out the hood but you can't take the hood out the homie 
 Took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey, Hollywood's nervous 
 Fuck you, good night, thank you much for your service"
69,Kendrick Lamar,hiphop,These Walls,"I remember you was conflicted 
 Misusing your influence 
 Sometimes, I did the same 
 If these walls could talk 
 If these walls could talk 
 If these walls could talk 
 If these walls could talk 
 If these walls could talk 
 If these walls could talk (Sex) 
 She just want to close her eyes and sway 
 With you, with you, with you 
 Exercise her right to work it out 
 It's true, it's true, it's true 
 Shout out to the birthday girls say hey, say hey 
 Everyone deserves a night to play 
 And she plays only when you tell her no 
 If these walls could talk 
 (I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you) 
 If these walls could talk 
 (I love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in it) 
 If these walls could talk they'd tell me to swim good 
 No boat, I float better than he would 
 No life jacket, I'm not the God of Nazareth 
 But your flood can be misunderstood 
 Walls telling me they full of pain, resentment 
 Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension 
 Me? I'm just a tenant 
 Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute 
 These walls are vulnerable, exclamation 
 Interior pink, color coordinated 
 I interrogated every nook and cranny 
 I mean it's still amazing before they couldn't stand me 
 These walls want to cry tears 
 These walls happier when I'm here 
 These walls never could hold up 
 Every time I come around demolition might crush 
 If these walls could talk 
 (I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you) 
 If these walls could talk 
 (I love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in it) 
 If these walls could talk they'd tell me to go deep 
 Yelling at me continuously, I can see 
 Your defense mechanism is my decision 
 Knock these walls down, that's my religion 
 Walls feeling like they ready to close in 
 I suffocate, then catch my second wind 
 I resonate in these walls 
 I don't know how long I can wait in these walls 
 I've been on these streets too long 
 Looking at you from the outside in 
 They sing the same old song 
 About how they walls always the cleanest 
 I beg to differ, I must've missed them 
 I'm not involved, I'd rather diss them 
 I'd rather call on you, put your wall up 
 'Cause when I come around demolition gon' crush 
 If these walls could talk 
 (I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you) 
 If these walls could talk 
 (I love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in it) 
 If your walls could talk, they'd tell you it's too late 
 Your destiny accepted your fate 
 Burn accessories and stash them where they are 
 Take the recipe, the Bible and God 
 Wall telling you that commissary is low 
 Race wars happening no calling CO 
 No calling your mother to save you 
 Homies to say you're reputable, not acceptable 
 Your behavior is Sammy the Bull-like 
 A killer that turned snitch 
 Walls is telling me you a bitch 
 You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them 
 That sentence so important 
 Walls telling you to listen to Sing About Me 
 Retaliation is strong, you even dream 'bout me 
 Killed my homeboy and God spared your life 
 Dumb criminal got indicted same night 
 So when you play this song, rewind the first verse 
 About me abusing my power so you can hurt 
 About me and her in the shower whenever she horny 
 About me and her in the after hours of the morning 
 About her baby daddy currently serving life 
 And how she think about you until we meet up at night 
 About the only girl cared about you when you asked her 
 And how she fucking on a famous rapper, walls could talk 
 I remember you was conflicted 
 Misusing your influence 
 Sometimes I did the same 
 Abusing my power full of resentment 
 Resentment that turned into a deep depression 
 Found myself screaming in a hotel room"

 Breakin' on marble floors, watchin' anonymous strangers tellin' me that I'm yours 
 But you ain't shit, I'm convinced your tolerance nothin' special 
 What can I blame you for? Nigga, I can name several 
 Situation had stopped with your little sister bakin' 
 A baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience? 
 Where was your antennas? Where is the influence you speak of? 
 You preached in front of a hundred thousand but never reached her 
 I fuckin' tell you, you fuckin' failure you ain't no leader 
 I never liked you, forever despise you I don't need you 
 The world don't need you, don't let them deceive you 
 Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, that's for dedication 
 Thought money would change you, made you more complacent 
 Fuckin' hate you, I hope you embrace it

 Kendrick Lamar: 
 You the reason why mama and them leavin' 
 No, you ain't shit, you say you love them, I know you don't mean it 
 I know you're irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it 
 Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it 
 Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out 
 You was deserted, where was your antennas again? 
 Where was your presence? Where was your support that you pretend? 
 You ain't no brother, you ain't no disciple, you ain't no friend 
 A friend never leave Compton for profit or leave his best friend 
 Little brother, you promised you’d watch him before they shot him 
 Where was your antennas? On the road, bottles and bitches 
 You faced time the one time, that's unforgiven 
 You even Facetimed instead of a hospital visit 
 Bitch, you thought he would recover well 
 Third surgery couldn't stop the bleeding for real 
 Then he died, God himself will say, ""You fuckin' failed, you ain't try"" 
 I know your secrets nigga, mood swings is frequent nigga 
 I know depression is restin' on your heart for two reasons nigga 
 I know you and a couple block boys ain't been speakin' nigga 
 Y'all damn near beefin', I seen it and you're the reason nigga 
 And if this bottle could talk 
 I cry myself to sleep, bitch everything is your fault 
 Faults breakin' to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend 
 Because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed 
 I know your secrets, dn't let me tell them to the world about that shit you thinkin' 
 And that time you, I'm 'bout to hurl 
 I'm fucked up, but I ain't as fucked up as you 
 You just can't get right, I think your heart made of bulletproof 
 Shoulda killed your ass a long time ago 
 You shoulda feeled that black revolver blast a long time ago 
 And if those mirrors could talk it would say, ""You gotta go"" 
 And if I told your secrets, the world'll know money can't stop a suicidal weakness"

 Mimicking radio's nemesis made me whack 
 My innocence limited the experience lacked 
 Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked 
 The mind of a literate writer but I did it in fact 
 You admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plastic 
 Remember scribblin' scratchin' diligent sentences backwards 
 Visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction 
 Now I can live in a stadium, pack it the fastest 
 Gamblin' Benjamin benefits, sinnin' in traffic 
 Spinnin' women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion 
 Winnin' in every decision, Kendrick is master that mastered it 
 Isn't it lovely how menaces turned attraction? 
 Pivotin' rappers, finish your fraction while writing blue magic

 I know if I'm generous at heart, I don't need recognition 
 The way I'm rewarded, well, that's God's decision 
 I know you know that line's for Compton School District 
 Just give it to the kids, don't gossip about how it was distributed, I know how people work 
 I know the price of life, I'm knowin' how much it's worth 
 I know what I know and I know it well not to ever forget 
 Until I realized I didn't know shit the day I came home 
 We been waitin' for you, waitin' for you 
 Waitin' for you, waitin' for you 
 I met a little boy that resembled my features 
 Nappy afro, gap in his smile, hand me down sneakers bounced through the crowd 
 Run a number on man and woman that crossed him 
 Sun beamin' on his beady beads exhausted 
 Tossin' footballs with his ashy black ankles 
 Breakin' new laws, mama passed on home trainin' 
 He looked at me and said, ""Kendrick, you do know my language 
 You just forgot because of what public schools had painted 
 Oh, I forgot, ""Don't Kill My Vibe,"" that's right, you're famous 
 I used to watch on Channel 5, TV was taken 
 But never mind you're here right now, don't you mistake it 
 It's just a new trip, take a glimpse at your family's ancestor 
 Make a new list of everything you thought was progress 
 And that was bullshit, I mean your life is full of turmoil 
 Spoiled by fantasies of who you are, I feel bad for you 
 I can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin' you 
 If you resist, I'll back off quick, go catch a flight or two 
 But if you pick destiny over rest in peace then be an advocate 
 Tell your homies especially to come back home""

 Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel

 Fifty nigga salute, out the Compton zoo, with the extras 
 El 'Cause, Monte Carlos, Road Kings and dressers 
 Rip Ridaz, P-Funkers, Mexicans, they fuck with you

 We was in the hood, fourteen with the deuce-deuce 
 Fourteen years later going hard like we used to on the dead homies 
 On the dead homies 
 Hopped out the caddy, just got my dick sucked 
 The little homies called, they said, ""The enemies done cliqued up"" 
 Oh, yeah? Puto want to squabble with mi barrio? 
 Oh, yeah? Tell 'em they can run it for the cardio 
 Oh, yeah? Everythin' is everythin', it's scandalous 
 Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras 
 The LAPD gamblin', scramblin', football numbers slanderin' 
 Niggas name on paper, you snitched all summer 
 Streets don't fail me now 
 They tell me it's a new gang in town 
 From Compton to Congress, set trippin' all around 
 Ain't nothin' new but a flu of new DemoCrips and ReBloodlicans 
 Red state versus a blue state, which one you governin'? 
 They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs 
 Make it they promise to fuck with you 
 No condom, they fuck with you

 Everybody want to talk about who this and who that 
 Who the realest and who wack, or who white or who black 
 Critics want to mention that they miss when hip hop was rappin' 
 Motherfucker, if you did, then Killer Mike'd be platinum 
 Y'all priorities fucked up, put energy in wrong shit 
 Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since 
 Don't ask me 'bout no camera blocking at award shows 
 No, don't ask about my bitch, no, don't ask about my foes 
 'Less you askin' me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it 
 I'm the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button 
 Had the Coast on standby 
 ""K. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up Pandora's box"" 
 I box 'em all in, by a landslide 
 Nah homie we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets 
 I make the call and get the coast involved then history repeats 
 But I resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with Jay 
 He said, ""It's funny how one verse could fuck up the game"" 
 I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo 
 I remember you was conflicted 
 Misusing your influence 
 Sometimes I did the same 
 Abusing my power full of resentment 
 Resentment that turned into a deep depression 
 Found myself screaming in a hotel room 
 I didn't want to self-destruct 
 The evils of Lucy was all around me 
 So I went running for answers 
 Until I came home 
 But that didn't stop survivors guilt 
 Going back and forth 
 Trying to convince myself the stripes I earned 
 Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was 
 But while my loved ones was fighting 
 A continuous war back in the city 
 I was entering a new one"
75,Kendrick Lamar,hiphop,How Much A Dollar Cost,"How much a dollar really cost? 
 The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts 
 Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all 
 Gotta see how I'm chillin' once I park this luxury car 
 Hopping out, feeling big as Mutombo 
 Twenty on pump six, dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo 
 Twenty years ago, can't forget, now I can lend all my ear or two 
 How to stack these residuals tenfold, the liberal concept of what men'll do 
 Twenty on six, he didn't hear me 
 Indigenous African only spoke Zulu, my American tongue was slurry 
 Walked out the gas station, a homeless man with a semi-tan complexion 
 Asked me for ten 'rand, stressin' about dry land 
 Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open 
 A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin', he begged and pleaded 
 Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it, told him, ""Beat it"" 
 Contributin' money just for his pipe, I couldn't see it 
 He said, ""My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated 
 Listen to me, I want a single bill from you, nothin' less, nothin' more"" 
 I told him I ain't have it and closed my door, tell me how much a dollar cost 
 It's more to feed your mind 
 Water, sun, and love, the one you love 
 All you need, the air you breathe 
 He's starin' at me in disbelief 
 My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key 
 He's starin' at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave 
 And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see 
 The reason why he was mad at a stranger like I was supposed to save him 
 Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor 
 He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser 
 He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious 
 'Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect 
 If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck 
 I never understood someone beggin' for goods 
 Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could 
 And this particular person just had it down pat 
 Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked 
 ""Have you ever opened up Exodus 14? 
 A humble man is all that we ever need, tell me how much a dollar cost"" 
 It's more to feed your mind 
 Water, sun, and love, the one you love 
 All you need, the air you breathe 
 Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment 
 I never met a transient that demanded attention 
 They got me frustrated, indecisive, and power trippin' 
 Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different 
 I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless 
 My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'? 
 So I'mma tell you like I told the last bum 
 Crumbs and pennies, I need all of mines 
 And I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time 
 I got better judgement, I know when nigga's hustlin', keep in mind 
 When I was strugglin', I did compromise, now I comprehend 
 I smell grandpa's old medicine reekin' from your skin 
 Moonshine and gin, nigga you're babblin', your words ain't flatterin' 
 I'm imaginin' Denzel but lookin' at O'Neal 
 Kazaam is sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre 
 The jig is up, I seen you from a mile away losin' focus 
 And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy 
 He looked at me and said, ""Your potential is bittersweet"" 
 I looked at him and said, ""Every nickel is mines to keep"" 
 He looked at me and said, ""Know the truth, it'll set you free 
 You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehovah, the higher power 
 The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit 
 The nerve of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost 
 The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss, I am God"" 
 I wash my hands, I said my grace, what more do you want from me? 
 Tears of a clown, guess I'm not all what is meant to be 
 Shades of grey will never change if I condone 
 Turn this page, help me change, so right my wrongs"

 Complexion don't mean a thing (It's a Zulu love) 
 Ooh, complexion (Two-step) 
 It all feels the same (It's a Zulu love) 
 Dark as the midnight hour or bright as the mornin' sun 
 Give a fuck about your complexion, I know what the Germans done 
 Sneak (dissin'), sneak me through the back window, I'm a good field nigga 
 I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you

 Complexion (Two-step) 
 Complexion don't mean a thing (It's a Zulu love) 
 Ooh, complexion (Two-step)

 Dark as the midnight hour, I'm bright as the mornin' sun 
 Brown skinned, but your blue eyes tell me your mama can't run 
 Sneak (dissin'), sneak me through the back window, I'm a good field nigga 
 I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you 
 You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down 
 Even if master's listenin', I got the world's attention 
 So I'mma say somethin' that's vital and critical for survival 
 Of mankind, if he lyin', color should never rival 
 Beauty is what you make it, I used to be so mistaken 
 By different shades of faces then Whit told me, ""A woman is woman, love the creation"" 
 It all came from God then you was my confirmation, I came to where you reside 
 And looked around to see more sights for sore eyes 
 Let the Willie Lynch theory reverse a million times with 
 Complexion (Two-step) 
 Complexion don't mean a thing (It's a Zulu love)

 You like it, I love it, you like it, I love it 
 You like it, I love it, you like it, I love it 
 You like it, I love it, you like it, I love it 
 Where the homegirl Rapsody at? 
 I need you to speak your mind real quick loved one 
 Let me talk my Stu Scott, 'scuse me on my 2Pac 
 Keep your head up, when did you stop loving thy 
 Color of your skin, color of your eyes? 
 That's the real blues, baby, like you met Jay's baby 
 You blew me away, you think more beauty in blue, green and grey 
 All my solemn men up north, twelve years a slave 
 Twelve years of age, thinkin' my shade too dark 
 I love myself, I no longer need Cupid 
 Enforcin' my dark side like a young George Lucas 
 Light don't mean you smart, bein' dark don't make you stupid 
 And frame of mind for them bustas, ain't talkin', ""Woohah"" 
 Need a paradox for the pair of doc's they tutored 
 Like two Todd's, L-L, you lose two times 
 If you don't see you beautiful in your complexion 
 It ain't complex to put it in context 
 Find the air beneath the kite, that's the context 
 Yeah, baby, I'm conscious, ain't no contest 
 If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed 
 Ain't no stress, jigga boos wanna be 
 I ain't talkin' Jay, I ain't talkin' Bey 
 I'm talkin' days we got school watchin' movie screens and spike your self esteem 
 The new James Bond gon' be black as me 
 Black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea and it's all beautiful to me 
 Call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens 
 We all on the same team, blues and pirus, no colors ain't a thing 
 Barefoot babies with no cares 
 Teenage gun toters that don't play fair, should I get out the car? 
 I don't see Compton, I see something much worse 
 The land of the landmines, the hell that's on earth"
77,Kendrick Lamar,hiphop,The Blacker The Berry,"(They want us to bow) Everything black, I don't want black

 (And pray to a god) Some white, some black, I ain't mean black 
 (That we don't believe) I want everything black 
 Everything black, I want all things black 
 I don't need black, I want everything black 
 I don't need black, our eyes ain't black 
 I ain't own black, I want everything black 
 Six in the morn, fire in the street 
 Burn, baby, burn, that's all I wanna see 
 And sometimes I get off watching you die in vain 
 It's such a shame, they may call me crazy 
 They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or something, but, homie, you made me 
 Black don't crack, my nigga 
 I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015 
 Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean 
 Been feeling this way since I was sixteen, came to my senses 
 You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it 
 I'm African American, I'm African 
 I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village, pardon my residence 
 Came from the bottom of mankind 
 My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide 
 You hate me, don't you 
 You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture 
 You're fucking evil I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey 
 You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me 
 And this is more than confession 
 I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion 
 I'm guarding my feelings, I know that you feel it 
 You sabotage my community, making a killing 
 You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga 
 The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice 
 The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice 
 The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice 
 The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot 
 I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black 
 Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black 
 And man a say they put me in a chain, cah' we black 
 Imagine now, me gold chain full of rocks 
 How you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back 
 But now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block 
 All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black 
 Remember this, every race start from the black, just remember that 
 I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015 
 Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean 
 I mean it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society 
 That's what you're telling me, penitentiary would only hire me 
 Curse me till I'm dead 
 Church me with your fake prophesizing that I'mma be another slave in my head 
 Institutionalize manipulation and lies 
 Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes 
 You hate me, don't you 
 I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself 
 Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt 
 Watching me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out 
 Muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah 
 Black and successful, this black man meant to be special 
 CAT scans on my radar, bitch, how can I help you 
 How can I tell you I'm making a killing 
 You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga 
 The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice

 Remember this, every race start from the black, just remember that 
 I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015 
 When I finish this, if you listen, I'm sure you will agree 
 This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred 
 It's genocism, it's grimy little justification 
 I'm African American, I'm African 
 I'm black as the heart of a fucking Aryan 
 I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Darius 
 Excuse my French, but fuck you, no fuck y'all 
 That's as blunt as it gets 
 I know you hate me, don't you 
 You hate my people, I can tell 'cause it's threats when I see you 
 I can tell cause your ways deceitful 
 Know I can tell because you're in love with the Desert Eagle 
 Thinking maliciously, he get a chain, then you gon' bleed him 
 It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war 
 Two tribal armies that want to build and destroy 
 Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door 
 Beefing with Pirus, only death settle the score 
 So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers 
 Or tell Georgia State Marcus Garvey got all the answers 
 Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day 
 Or eat watermelon, chicken and Kool-Aid on weekdays 
 Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements 
 Or watch BET cause urban support is important 
 So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street 
 When gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me

 Keep my money in the ceiling, let my mama know I'm free 
 Give my story to the children and the lesson they can read 
 And the glory to the feeling of the only unseen

 When shit hit the fan (One two, one two), uh 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask your friends 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 Do you believe in me? Are you deceiving me? 
 Could I let you down easily? Is your heart where it need to be? 
 Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime? 
 Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line? 
 If I'm tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off 
 If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car 
 Would you judge me a drughead or see me as K. Lamar 
 Or question my character and degrade me on every blog? 
 Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson 
 I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you're very welcome 
 You tell me my song is more than a song, it's surely a blessing 
 But a prophet ain't a prophet till they ask you this question

 You think she gon' stick around if them twenty-five years occur? 
 You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars hurt? 
 You think y'all on common ground if you promise to be the first? 
 Can you be immortalised without your life being expired? 
 Even though you share the same blood, is it worth the time? 
 Like who got your best interest? Like how much are you dependent? 
 How clutch are the people that say they love you and who pretending? 
 How tough is your skin when they turn you in, do you show forgiveness? 
 What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended? 
 What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing? 
 What kind of bridge did they burn, revenge or your mind when it's mentioned? 
 You wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson 
 You wanna walk in in his shoes but you peace-making seldom 
 You wanna be remembered that delivered the message 
 That considered the blessing of everyone, this your lesson for everyone, say 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask your friends

 As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression

 I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues 
 I hold grudges like bad judges, don't let me resent you 
 That's not Nelson-like, want you to love me like Nelson 
 I went to Robben's Island analyzing, that's where his cell is 
 So I could find clarity, like how much you cherish me 
 Is this relationship a fake or real as the heavens be? 
 See I got to question it all, family, friends, fans, cats, dogs

 Generation X, will I ever be your X? 
 Floss off a baby step, mauled by the mouth of pitbulls, put me under stress 
 Crawled under rocks, ducking y'all, it's respect 
 But then tomorrow, put my back against the wall 
 How many leaders you said you needed then left 'em for dead? 
 Is it Moses, is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red? 
 Is it Martin Luther, JFK, shoot or you assassin? 
 Is it Jackie, is it Jesse? Oh I know, it's Michael Jackson, oh 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 That nigga gave us Billie Jean, you say he touched those kids? 
 When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan? 
 The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it 
 Let my word be your earth and moon you consume every message 
 As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression 
 And if you riding with me nigga, let me ask this question nigga 
 I remember you was conflicted 
 Misusing your influence 
 Sometimes I did the same 
 Abusing my power, full of resentment 
 Resentment that turned into a deep depression 
 Found myself screaming in the hotel room 
 I didn't wanna self destruct 
 The evils of Lucy was all around me 
 So I went running for answers 
 Until I came home 
 But that didn't stop survivor's guilt 
 Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned 
 Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was 
 But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one 
 A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination 
 Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned 
 The word was respect 
 Just because you wore a different gang color than mine's 
 Doesn't mean I can't respect you as a black man 
 Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets 
 If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us 
 But I don't know 
 I'm no mortal man 
 Maybe I'm just another nigga 
 Shit and that's all I wrote 
 I was gonna call it ""Another Nigga"" but it ain't really a poem, I just felt like it's something you probably could relate to 
 Other than that, now that I finally got a chance to holler at you, I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa- 
 About a metaphor actually, uh you spoke on the ground 
 What you mean 'bout that, what the ground represent? 
 Tupac Shakur and Kendrick Lamar: 
 The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil (Right) 
 That's how I see it, my word is bond 
 I see and the ground is the symbol for the poor people (Right), the poor people is gonna open up this whole world and swallow up the rich people 
 'Cause the rich people gonna be so fat, they gonna be so appetizing, you know what I'm saying? 
 Wealthy, appetizing, the poor gonna be so poor and hungry, you know what I'm saying? 
 It's gonna be like, you know what I'm saying? 
 It's gonna be like, there might be some cannibalism out this mother, they might eat the rich 
 (Aight so let me ask you this then 
 Do you see yourself as somebody that's rich or somebody that made the best of they own opportunities?) 
 I see myself as a natural born hustler, a true hustler in every sense of the word 
 I took nothin', I took the opportunities, I worked at the most menial and degrading job and built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it 
 I went from having somebody manage me to me hiring the person that works my management company 
 I changed everything, I realised my destiny in a matter of five years you know what I'm saying? 
 I made myself a millionaire 
 I made millions for a lot of people now it's time to make millions for myself, you know what I'm saying? 
 I made millions for the record companies, I made millions for these movie companies, now I make millions for, for us 
 (And through your different avenues of success, how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?) 
 By my faith in God, by my faith in the game, and by my faith in all good, all good things come to those that stay true, you know what I'm saying? 
 And it was happening to me for a reason, you know what I'm saying? 
 I was noticing, shit, I was punching the right buttons and it was happening 
 So it's no problem, you know I mean it's a problem but I'm not finna let them know, I'm finna go straight through 
 (Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that, heh, somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?) 
 Shit, I like to think that at every opportunity I've ever been uh threatened with resistance it's been met with resistance 
 And not only me but it goes down my family tree, you know what I'm saying? 
 It's in my veins to fight back 
 (Aight well, how long you think it take before niggas be like, ""We fighting a war, I'm fighting a war I can't win and I wanna lay it all down"") 
 In this country a black man only have like five years we can exhibit maximum strength, and that's right now while you a teenager, while you still strong or while you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back 
 'Cause once you turn thirty it's like they take the heart and soul out of a man, out of a black man in this country and you don't wanna fight no more 
 And if you don't believe me you can look around, you don't see no loud mouth thirty-year old motherfuckers 
 (That's crazy, because me being one of your offspring of the legacy you left behind, I can truly tell you that there's nothing but turmoil goin' on so I wanted to ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation today?) 
 I think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores and next time it's a riot there's gonna be, like, uh, bloodshed for real 
 I don't think America know that 
 I think American think we was just playing and it's gonna be some more playing but it ain't gonna be no playing 
 It's gonna be murder, you know what I'm saying? 
 It's gonna be like Nat Turner 1831 up in this motherfucker 
 You know what I'm saying? It's gonna happen 
 Kendrick Lamar and Tupac Shakur: 
 That's crazy man 
 In my opinion, only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations, lotta people don't understand how important it is 
 Sometimes I be like, get behind a mic and I don't know what type of energy I'mma push out, or where it comes from 
 Trip me out sometimes 
 (Because the spirits, we ain't even really rappin', we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us) 
 Kendrick Lamar: 
 Damn 
 I wanted to read one last thing to you 
 It's actually something a good friend had wrote describing my world 
 It says 
 ""The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it 
 Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it, in order to protect itself from this mad city 
 While consuming its environment, the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive 
 One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him, but praises the butterfly 
 The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness, and the beauty within the caterpillar 
 But having a harsh outlook on life, the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits 
 Already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him 
 He can no longer see past his own thoughts, he's trapped 
 When trapped inside these walls certain ideas start to take roots, such as going home and bringing back new concepts to this mad city 
 The result? 
 Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant 
 Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle 
 Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different, they are one and the same"" 
 What's your perspective on that? 
 Pac? Pac? Pac"

 Oh, you want me to touch you right there?

 Push it back on daddy 
 Push it back on daddy baby 
 I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory, life is... 
 I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory 
 Life is long as infinity this was the final calling 
 No birds chirping or flying, no dogs barking 
 We all nervous and crying, moving in caution 
 In disbeliefs our believe's the reason for all this 
 The tallest building plummet, cracking and crumbling 
 The ground is shaking, swallowing young woman 
 With a baby, daisies, and other flowers burning in destruction 
 The smell is disgusting, the heat is unbearable 
 Preachers touching on boys run for cover, they paranoid 
 Rapists and murderers hurdle alleys 
 Valleys and high places turn into dust 
 Famous screaming in agony 
 Atheists for suicide, planes falling out the sky 
 Trains jumping off the track, mothers yelling ""he's alive"" 
 Backpedaling christians settling for forgiveness 
 Evidence all around us the town is covered in fishes 
 Ocean water dried out, fire burning more tires out 
 Tabernacle and city capital turned inside out 
 Public bathroom, college classroom's been deserted 
 Another trumpet has sounded off and everyone heard it 
 (It's happening) no more running from world wars 
 (It's happening) no more discriminating the poor 
 (It's happening) no more bad bitches and real niggas 
 Wishing for green and gold the last taste of allure 
 I swore I seen it vividly 
 I mine a couple from heaven that play the symphony 
 Thunder like number four, then I heard 
 ""What have you did for me"" 
 I fell to my knees, pulled out my resume 
 That dated back to June 17th, 1987 
 My paperwork was like a receipt 
 I was valedictorian, I was fearful of judgment 
 But confident I had glory in all my past endeavors 
 Close my eyes pray to god that I live forever 
 Dark skies, fire and brimstone some of us sent home 
 Some of us never did wrong but still went to hell 
 Geez Louise I thought you said that I excel 
 I made To Pimp a Butterfly 'fore you told me 
 To use my vocals to save man-kind for you 
 Say I didn't try for you, say I didn't ride for you 
 I tied for you, I pushed the club to the side for you 
 Who love you like I love you? 
 Crucifix, tell me you can fix 
 Anytime I need, I'mma start jotting everything in my diary 
 Never would you lie to me 
 Always camaraderie, I can see, our days been numbered 
 Revelation greatest as we hearing the last trumpet 
 All man, child, woman, life completely went in reverse 
 I guess I'm running in place trying to make it to church 
 Young nigga act an ass 
 Young nigga act a fool 
 Young nigga get yo' cash 
 Young nigga do what it do 
 Young nigga go, young nigga go 
 Young nigga go, young nigga go 
 Whatever makes all of you happy in this bitch 
 Just take it all back before the light switch"

I was tryna spit my best game to her, you know, give her my best cap, but she kept on snapping her fingers like *snaps*. I said ""You know what, girl? You crazy."" Then she asked me what he said

 A peace of mind 
 That's what the Asian said, I need a divine 
 Intervention was his religion and now it's a prize 
 Him believing in Buddha, me believing in God 
 Asked me what am I doing, he said ""taking my time"" 
 Meditation is a must, it don't hurt if you try

 Worried about your career, ever think of your health? 
 (What did the Indian say?) 
 A piece of land 
 That's what the Indian said, I needed demand 
 Telling me longevity is in the dirt, buy some property first 
 Profit a better dollar with generational perks 
 Equity at his best, really, you should invest 
 These tangible things expire, don't you expect 
 Income with so much outcome and yes 
 Look at my heritage, we blessed 
 (Now what the black man say?) 
 A piece of nookie 
 That's what the black man said, I needed to push me 
 To the limit, satisfy my hunger 
 Do it all for a woman, hair cut to a wool 
 We like to live in the jungle, like to play in the peach 
 What you saying to me? 
 He said ""homie, come back to reality for a week"" 
 Nookie is power, cut on a new chick every night 
 I wouldn't be prouder, you should allow it

 A piece of mines

 What if I compromise? He said it don't even matter 
 Make a million or more, you living better than average 
 You losing your core following, gaining it all

 Hit the bank and withdraw, hit the bank and withdraw 
 Put myself in the rocket ship and I shot for the stars 
 Tell me what you accomplished and what he said to the boy 
 I'mma make you some promises that you just can't ignore

 I don't target your market 
 You ain't signing your signature when I throw you my wallet

 I just need a little space to breathe 
 I know perception is key, so I am king

 The borderline between insanity is Father Time 
 I fall behind my skeleton, they tell me that I'm blind 
 I know that I'm intelligence, my confidence just died 
 Carpe diem, seize the day, I can't compromise 
 A tapeworm couldn't cure this gluttonous appetite 
 A couple drinkers, they seein me as I pacify 
 But couldn't fathom the meaning of seein' sacrifice 
 I'm passin' lives on a daily, maybe I'm losing faith 
 Genocism and capitalism just made me hate 
 Correctionals and these private prisons gave me a date 
 Professional dream killers reason why I'm awake

 Crash markets and prejudiced tags, look at my photo 
 Black excellence, pessimist died countin' my coin 
 Hope it's evident that I inspired a thousand emcees to do better 
 I blew cheddar on youth centers, buildings and Bimmers and blue leather 
 Forcasted my future, this is the future 
 The mastermind until my next album, more power to you

 Hey one more time, band, I need y'all to help me out right now

 Walking around with them blue faces 
 She said I'm down on my luck 
 And it's something I gotta have 
 Blue faces 
 I hit the bank today and told them color me bad 
 Blue faces 
 Get that new money, and it's breaking me down, honey 
 Two tears in the bucket I cry with you 
 But I could never lie with you 
 I could never afford not to afford 
 I could never put my plans to the side with you 
 I could never see a red light 
 Like a deer with a headlight 
 I freeze up when I re-up 
 See, I barely have patience 
 And you're relating 
 Only the moment to complete us 
 Why you hate to work for it 
 The reason I never went to work for it 
 See a nine to five was so jive turkey 
 But when Thanksgiving came, that check didn't hurt me 
 You plead the fifth 
 I read the fifth amendment 
 We both criminals with bad intentions 
 They say time heals all 
 But if I can shortcut 
 My success, Corvettes by tomorrow 
 Now why you so sad 
 Walking around with them blue faces 
 She said I'm down on my luck 
 And it's something I gotta have 
 Blue faces 
 I hit the bank today and told them color me bad 
 Blue faces 
 Get that new money, and it's breaking me down, honey 
 My home girl got a credit card scam 
 She got a scholarship to college, but she don't give a damn 
 Intuition she got a broke bitch wishin' 
 She tell me this on the phone with the noodles in the pan 
 I know you, woman, I console you, woman 
 You feel like the universe owe you, woman 
 Oh the anticipation of hoping you could make it 
 Bitches don't prosper chasing education 
 But you're talented, and can't handle it 
 And your homegirls can't be your manager 
 Three sixty-five times four plus more 
 If you can't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina 
 But shit, ain't no money like fast money 
 Even today I'm considered a crash dummy 
 A rapper chasing stardom, how can I fast forward 
 My accolades better than all them 
 Why you so sad 
 Walking around with them blue faces 
 She said I'm down on my luck 
 And it's something I gotta have 
 Blue faces 
 I hit the bank today and told them color me bad 
 Blue faces 
 Get that new money, and it's breaking me down, honey 
 I wrote this song looking at a broke home baby (broke home baby) 
 You know the poverty stricken, the little broke boy and babies 
 Somebody yell, ""Kendrick, American, they sho' is crazy"" 
 And I said ""why"" 
 Then he looked me in the eye 
 And said, ""Nigga, you fucked up 
 You're banking on good luck 
 You wishing for miracles 
 You never been through shit 
 You're crying hysterical 
 You settle for everything, complain about everything 
 You say you sold crack, my world amphetamine 
 Your projects ain't shit, I live in a hut, bitch 
 I'm living to keep warm, you living to pay rent 
 I prayed my way through by waiting on Allah 
 You played your way through by living in sci-fi 
 Bullshitting yourself, you talking to strangers 
 Same thing goes for the ones you came with 
 When y'all came on the boat looking for hope 
 And all you can say is that you're looking for dope 
 These days ain't no compromise 
 And your pain ain't mines half the time 
 A brand new excuse ain't nothing to me 
 Bitch, I made my moves with shackled feet 
 Cape Town"" 
 In today's day and age we practice the self-pity of taking the easy way out 
 You wait on them, him and her 
 But when a blessing takes too long, that's when you go wrong 
 You selfish motherfucker 
 Why so sad 
 Walking around with them blue faces 
 She said I'm down on my luck 
 And it's something I gotta have 
 Blue faces 
 I hit the bank today and told them color me bad 
 Blue faces 
 Get that new money, and it's breaking me down, honey

 So I was takin' a walk the other day, and I seen a woman-a blind woman-pacin' up and down the sidewalk. She seemed to be a bit frustrated, as if she had dropped somethin' and havin' a hard time findin' it. So after watchin' her struggle for a while, I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know? ""Hello, ma'am, can I be of any assistance? It seems to me that you have lost something. I would like to help you find it."" She replied: ""Oh yes, you have lost something. You've lost your life."" 
 Is it wickedness? 
 Lamar stated his views on police brutality with that line in the song, quote: ""And we hate the popo, wanna kill us in the street fo' sho'...""

 I wake in the mornin', my head spinnin' from the last night 
 Both in the trance, feelings I did-what a fast life! 
 Manager called, the lobby called, it's 11:30 
 Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early 
 Room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change 
 Fumbled my jewelry, 100k, I lost a new chain 
 Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M 
 Take me a nap and do it again 
 We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news 
 Lookin' for confirmation, hopin' election wasn't true 
 All of us worried, all of us buried, and our feeling's deep 
 None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap 
 Still and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it 
 Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly 
 Time passin', things change 
 Revertin' back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways; lust 
 Lately, I feel like I been lustin' over the fame 
 Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame 
 Lately, lately, lately, my lust been hidin' (Lately) 
 Lately, it's all contradiction 
 Lately, I'm not here 
 Lately, I lust over self 
 Lust turn into fear 
 Lately, in James 4:4 says 
 Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord 
 Brace yourself, lust is all yours 
 I need some water 
 Somethin' came over me 
 Way too high to simmer down 
 Might as well overheat

 Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds

 He was lookin' for some closure 
 Hopin' I could bring him closer 
 To the spiritual, my spirit do no better, but I told him 
 ""I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel: 
 If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed.""

 All the memories collected, moments you could never touch

 Now... 
 When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear 
 Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years 
 My newfound life made all of me magnified 
 How many accolades do I need to block denial? 
 The shock value of my success put bolts in me 
 All this money, is God playin' a joke on me? 
 Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job? 
 Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before? 
 At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all 
 Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall 
 Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin' 
 30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus 
 What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks 
 Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt? 
 I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered 
 How did the bad girl feel when she looked at them numbers? 
 The type of shit'll make me flip out 
 And just kill somethin', drill somethin' 
 Get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin' 
 I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck 
 At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged 
 How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city 
 What they say 'bout me reveal 
 If my reputation would miss me 
 What they see from me 
 Would trickle down generations in time 
 What they hear from me 
 Would make 'em highlight my simplest lines 
 I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity 
 I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me 
 I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride 
 'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God 
 I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone 
 I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more 
 I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness 
 Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive 
 Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth 
 And I can't take these feelings with me 
 So hopefully they disperse 
 Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax 
 Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back 
 Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth 
 And I can't take these feelings with me 
 So hopefully they disperse 
 Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax 
 Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap 
 Damn 
 Goddamn you 
 Goddamn me 
 Goddamn us 
 Goddamn we 
 Goddamn us all 
 Verse two says you only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities. So until we come back to these commandments, until you come back to these commandments, we're gonna feel this way, we're gonna be under this curse. Because he said he's gonna punish us, the so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians, are the true children of Israel. We are the Israelites according to the Bible. The children of Israel, he's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience, because we chose to follow other gods that aren't his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee. So, just like your children, your own son, he's gonna chastise you because he loves you. So that's why we get chastised, that's why we're in the position we're in. Until we come back to these laws, statutes and commandments, and do what the Lord said, these curses are gonna be upon us. We're gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live here in today, in the United States of America. I love you, son, and I pray for you. God bless you, shalom"

 Why, why, why, why? 
 Just remember, what happens on Earth stays on Earth! 
 We gon' put it in reverse 
 Darling, I told you many times 
 And I am telling you once again 
 Just to remind you, sweetheart, that my- 
 Oh Lamar, Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard 
 Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark 
 Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star 
 Life is one funny mothafucka 
 A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him 
 I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep 
 Introverted by my thoughts 
 Children, listen, it gets deep 
 See, once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects 
 The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect 
 Adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot 
 Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals 
 Anthony was the oldest of seven 
 Well-respected, calm and collected 
 Laughin' and jokin' made life easier 
 Hard times, Momma on crack 
 A four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her 
 His family history: pimpin' and bangin' 
 He was meant to be dangerous 
 Clocked him a grip and start slangin' 
 Fifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces 
 Even got some head from a smoker last weekend 
 Dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie 
 Small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him 
 10,000 dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily 
 Seen his first mil twenty years old, had a couple of babies 
 Had a couple of shooters 
 Caught a murder case, fingerprints on the gun they assumin' 
 But witnesses couldn't prove it 
 That was back when he turned his back 
 And they killed his cousin 
 He beat the case and went back to hustlin' 
 Bird-shufflin', Anthony rang 
 The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang 
 That 5.0 thing, they say 5-0 came 
 Circlin' parking lots and parking spots 
 And hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks 
 Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it 
 He brushed them off 
 And walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken 
 See, at this chicken spot 
 There was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot 
 With a curly top and a gap in his teeth 
 He worked the window, his name was Ducky 
 He came from the streets, the Robert Taylor Homes 
 Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome 
 Drove to California with a woman on him and 500 dollars 
 They had a son, hopin' that he'd see college 
 Hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it 
 Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends 
 Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket 
 'Cross the street from the projects 
 Anthony planned to rob it 
 Stuck up the place before, back in '84 
 That's when affiliation was really eight gears of war 
 So many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works 
 Killin' us, crime, intelligent, felonious 
 Prevalent proposition with 9's 
 Ducky was well-aware 
 They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year 
 He figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides 
 Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line 
 Two extra biscuits, Anthony liked him 
 And then let him slide; they didn't kill him 
 In fact, it look like they're the last to survive 
 Pay attention, that one decision changed both of they lives 
 One curse at a time 
 Reverse the manifest and good karma, and I'll tell you why 
 You take two strangers, and put 'em in random predicaments; give 'em a soul 
 So they can make their own choices and live with it 
 Twenty years later, them same strangers 
 You make 'em meet again 
 Inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits 
 Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident 
 Whoever thought the greatest rapper 
 Would be from coincidence? 
 Because if Anthony killed Ducky 
 Top Dawg could be servin' life 
 While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight 
 So, I was takin' a walk the other day..."

 And all I know is girl I'll owe 100, 100, 100 favors 
 I owe you 100 favors, 100, 100, 100 favors 
 Niggas all talk, it'll never change 
 Keep on choosin' do your thang 
 All them favors, I call her like a driver 
 Drowning in that pussy, and I'm a soul survivor 
 Vodka, hunned flavors, GT watermelon 
 She always do me favors, and I don't never tell her 
 GT yellow mango, I love to drink juice 
 Owe her 100 favors, I call her my 100 proof 
 Man I heard about an angel 
 Now I'm sitting here sippin' on the last bit of vodka 
 All I ever see is your face 
 Swear I be sitting here thinking 'bout the shit that you've been doing 
 And all I know is girl I'll owe 100, 100, 100 favors 
 I give you 100 favors, 100, 100, 100 favors 
 Now I'm sitting here sippin' on the last bit of chi... 
 All I ever see is your face 100 favors 
 Prices with the life, rollin' on them dice 
 Spent a mill on a flight 
 Flew back and she bounced back 
 High speed, all gold 
 Lord of the ring, we live that life big time 
 Big time, 100 times I gave my bitch the sunshine 
 Harley Davis, Harley Davis, 
 Twin came I gave my bitch a 100 favors 
 You was a college student abusing the credit union 
 The music was way too loud thought that tuition was fuckin' stupid 
 Me I was runnin' wild hittin' licks in my mothers' Buick 
 Confusing you like my style even though I was broke and do... 
 Sticks 'em up, you wanna pick 'em up 
 Inside your Civic plus the difference was 
 I wasn't rich as fuck you still would depend on us 
 And I missed a crush that we had every time when winter Decemeber come 
 And we had tempers and arguments dissagreements and senses from 
 Cupid himself, and I'm shootin' himself 
 And the paramedics wont come even if you scream for help 
 Don't let love die, you regroovin' yourself 
 I'm losing' on tool looking at you from poo hoo that's dealt 
 So when I reminisce the coupon we used to split at Baileys 
 On your mothers couch your little brother in the alley 
 You say K. Dot your things got to pay that Birdman and Jay got 
 One day he'll read what you saw, now I read for us both 
 That's 100"

 Wonderin' if I could live it all in one life 
 'Cause it could all end in one night 
 As I look up to the sky 
 I thought about a 100 things to do before I die 
 Couple niggas on the hitlist and bitches on a different type 
 Same shit different nights, till I live a different life 
 Sean you looking tired, damn homie that's all 
 I've been stressin' so hard I'm surprised I ain't going bald 
 Haters praying I fall, move back in with my moms 
 Take online classes and turn back into y'all, hatin' 
 I guess they want your lights out when you the plug 
 Niggas wanna catch you slippin like they pulled the rug 
 From where they move the drugs, buddha love 
 Niggas sleepin' with that mac and I ain't talkin' bout computer love 
 All the wrong people you a price tag 
 Now you pray to god hoping that you got a Christ tag 
 Make it where I'm from, stay who I become 
 Time to raise hell, say nay my son 
 Taking elevators straight up out the slums to a penthouse view 
 And have the fam there too

 Wake me up 
 You can't catch me dreamin' 
 Bout all of this muthafuckin' money 
 Cocaine rush, I'm speedin' 
 Cocaine rush 
 I'm just a detroit nigga, nothing extra about me 
 I go extra hard at the first second you doubt me 
 I strive for perfection at the same time 
 I'm accepting the fact that there'll never be nothing perfect about me 
 Shit, I'm just waiting on a win 
 Come up with better hooks, the hoes'll take it on the chin 
 We are 6 mile bred, that's why you see our sick style yeah 
 Crackhouse flow with a pit downstairs 
 Momma happy at me, daddy happy at me 
 The baddest chick is yonking, imagine this yapping at me 
 5 years ago I was in tears in the back of a paddy wagon 
 Now I'm cali swaggin' 
 My nigga listen, I'm over the fame 
 You number 1, I'm 23, my mission is take over the game 
 You rollin' with lames, we ain't rollin' the same 
 I'm the best out in this muthafucker 
 If I could get a check out of this muthafucka big enough to set my kids up for life 
 I could check out of this muthafucka, with no regrets 
 If you ain't living your life for ya kids, I ain't giving yo ass no respect

 I gotta break ya fuckin' heart 
 I gotta climb these fuckin' charts (I gotta climb) 
 I gotta do something that's innovative 
 Creative just to create a legacy before death do us part 
 I gotta spend one summer in Tijuana with tia and tia's momma 
 Breakfast in bed is head with plenty of carne asada (I gotta) 
 I gotta find me a wife to elope (I gotta) 
 I got a fine, 'cause I ain't wanna vote, I promise 
 I know the history of those who died for the rights for me to survive 
 But those who lied to the minority will make 'em turn inside they grave 
 I can easily pretend like y'all, but that's not me 
 I gotta spread the truth even when the truth can hurt the youth 
 Need to know every detail about this earth, the devil controls it 
 So before you scrutinize how I feel ask god if those polls important 
 The end is near!

 My heart numb, ain't no pain I can't withstand 
 And I hold my niggas down boy like a kickstand 
 Get off my nuts, stop acting like a bitch fam 
 Lil' nigga finish puberty, grow ya own dick damn 
 I went from watching time fly on Earl and Red porch 
 To cruising through the streets of Miami in a red Porsche 
 Me and Stunna fly, we should join the Air Force 
 Stand up niggas, the fuck you brought them chairs for?

 To thanking God I'm in a whole 'nother tax bracket, amen"

 I can choose my own (I could do better)

 Love is life and life is love, I like to love 
 Every part of you, the party life can never do enough 
 So many obstacles the possibilities are breaking up 
 Can move in hospital with that extra patient you got me stuck 
 I'll play the prostitute if you've got the patience to pimp me 
 But you never put me on the strip, put it on then you strip 
 Put it on your fingertips and I'll kiss it off 
 You better not kiss me goodbye, Test my faith and kiss the cross 
 I'm trying to go there, take you slow there if it's all right 
 Tell me that you care baby we could share a full life 
 Truth and double dare that I do repair broken hearts 
 Cupid shot me in the dark, stupid I didn't play my part 
 Ask for your forgiveness, if it's worth it I can serve a purpose 
 If I'm st- st- stuttering because I'm nervous 
 Tell me that you love me still 
 Promise that I'm staying still 
 Honesty is all I need 
 Honestly, we can build 
 The stakes are full now 
 Still wait for you

 The next day I woke up in the morning, seen you on the news

 Standin' on your table with a bottle and a drunk bitch 
 Fallin' all over spillin' drinks, tryin' to tongue kiss

 Push backwards like the bush whackers

 Y'all niggas picture near puttin' swag in your spliffs 
 My niggas cop the 7 just to laugh at the 6 
 Like ""nigga, do you know how much ass I'mma get?"" 
 Wrote a plan out, let's dip, we can market and sing 
 Put that cash in a stash, save that part for the rent 
 Only way niggas swingin' is to target the fence 
 That's why everything we're singing hit the target like Prince, man 
 I'm talkin' vanity and ""Can it be?""'s 
 Stickin' to the strategy, how simple can it be?

 Your false prophets will never jump in my pockets 
 You're poppin' your gums and I'm poppin' your optics 
 Optimus Prime when I'm done 
 And the topic of music is me 
 And the logic is usually 
 You should stop in and grab a degree 
 In the science of how to emcee 
 And I'm watchin' the critic critique 
 When I'm climbing the valleys and peaks 
 And aligning myself 
 While I'm riding Orion's belt

 I watched him as he took a fifth of Henny to the head in memory of his brother 
 Reminiscing on them playing Sega with each other 
 He was hurting, I can see it, plenty tears, no Kleenex 
 I stood by his side because that was my homie 
 Gave him a hug, some of his brother's blood got on me 
 Clinching his fist on some angry shit 
 Stood up, sat back down on the curb and asked me who they be hangin' with 
 I wasn't sure so I gave him no answer 
 But I was sure that he had him a blammer and wanted war 
 Revenge, what do you say to a good friend 
 That just lost it and grabbin' choppers out of the closet 
 I tried my best to make him renig 
 But he was like, my nig this feeling is more than personal 
 I stood down 
 He hopped in a four door, Honda Accord before he 
 Bent the block, he said K Dot 
 ""(You wouldn't understand) 
 These streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes 
 Not by choice, but forced to be a menace 
 Can someone just pray for me, or war 
 (Or at least, try to understand) the city pressure 
 The AK-47, twin MAC-11s 
 The Desert Eagle, shotty and the Smith and Wessons 
 Pray for me, or war"" 
 Corners become monuments for the dead 
 Candles on the pavement, postcard read 
 Rest in peace, the yellow tape blockin' off the streets 
 A baby mama yellin' at the police 
 But you don't understand 
 You figure that we're just a bunch of niggas but the picture here's a story untold 
 Y' see this wasn't in our plans 
 Babies from the late 80s wasn't born crazy, we was raised that way 
 Put that Malcolm X book down then raise that K 
 Complete chaos when we off x pills and St. Ides 
 Look the devil in the face, from a sane eye 
 Cast the spell on you like Akeelah and the Bee 
 Every killer in the street is a teen with a corrupted, mind 
 Substance, time, is no longer an issue 
 We don't have it, so pass the tissue 
 Then close the casket, kiss the momma when you can 
 And tell her you understand, but you don't understand 
 He came back fifteen minutes later 
 He said, ""Dot, I went on one, do me this favor 
 Dump these guns in a safe place, let nobody see you 
 This as critical as it gets, my nigga I need you"" 
 I said all right, so what happened? ""Seen a few niggas slippin 
 And I just started clappin, I didn't care who I was hittin"" 
 That's wild shit, but anyway I got you 
 I love you nigga make sure you hit me up by tomorrow 
 I woke up the next mornin' with a cold 
 Allergies got me sneezin and wipin' my nose when it was leaking 
 Checked the medicine cabinet, lookin' for some Dayquil 
 But all I seen was some Asprin, just my luck 
 I got up, went to Rite Aid 
 Hoping that the pharmacy department had the right aid - I bought it and left 
 Walked to the parking lot, when I see the faces of death 
 Said they was lookin' for my man with a chopper in they hand 
 Prayin' it would jam, but you don't understand 
 It's like a revolving door that I've been a part of my whole life. fucked up right?"
112,Kendrick Lamar,hiphop,Enjoy (West Coastin'),"Yeah give respect to the [?] finger

113,Kendrick Lamar,hiphop,Fight The Feeling,"So watch 'em do the Macarena, somewhere out by Pasadena 
 Love a drug that everybody here just tryna get a taste of 
 You a waste of the space that you take up 
 Livin', this time around I'm not kiddin' 
 I had an intuition about these women and suspicions 
 Got me lookin' at you different, how I'm a man in my position 
 Can't stop slippin' down these slopes 
 'Cause it's all just downhill from there 
 As a kid I didn't learn that, but now I'm aware 
 When you were young and you just tryna live your life and have some fun 
 In a world where you have yet to see how evil it's become 
 It's hard to have a dream when you deep inside of one 
 And I know you hate them spirits so I keep 'em in my lungs 
 I'm a Beatle to these young kids 
 But sometimes I be feelin' like a needle to these young kids 
 You had the world, you about to leave it to these young kids 
 And we gonna show you what the love is 
 Stay high, go for what you know 
 Let it in your mental 
 And don't ever let it go 
 It won't stop! 
 You can't fight the feeling 
 You can't fight the feeling, no 
 Uh, and I keep a couple most dope homies by me 
 So there ain't too many times it's me, myself and Irene 
 We stay smokin' through the night wake up, do some Tai Chi 
 Homie can't you see I'm chillin' please don't fuck up my Chi 
 Yeah my jacket Y 3, recently been up on fashion 
 Waste a bunch of money, kinda stinks of sastisfaction 
 Fell asleep in Hollywood, woke up in Manhattan 
 Ballin' like I'm Jordan, but I'm fresh as Mars Blackmon 
 A penny for your thoughts, a dollar for your dreams 
 A price on an idea, we never can agree 
 They tell you what to know, but it's better to believe 
 So why you tryna act like what you never gonna be? 
 Still I tell 'em ""fuck what you know, I'm feelin' comfortable"" 
 Just continue livin' life, cause enough of 'em don't 
 You spent your days countin' every single penny made 
 Store it now, 'cause we comin' for you anyways 
 Sometimes I wake up, up in the mornin', make up breakfast 
 Practice wipping make up off my bed soon as she yawning 
 Take up hours out my day just do find power, shit to say, but 
 You won't hear it, even if your ears was pierced with Beats by Dre 
 I mean, the sun is slowly fallin' 
 We all surely die eventually, so what's your callin'? 
 Oh, you left your phone behind? Identity 
 Crisis, break mirrors, vices steer us through wickedness 
 Jesus Christ is right near us and devil say you owe ten percent 
 Sold your soul, I know, sold your soul and you're hopeless 
 My focus, stare at elopin' on boats that float in the open 
 On oceans that coast the line on the margins I rhyme, chokin' 
 Or Soakin' up game, I'm hopin' 
 You peeped the second one, chain, the emotional jealousy you're holdin' 
 You're telling me, That you're golden, but you're really cubic zirconium 
 Let me see, I'll break you down like a pound of fire whenever 
 But your tactics are mighty clever, but even if you Mayweather 
 You can't fight the feeling"

 I'll give it to you"
115,Kendrick Lamar,hiphop,I Hate U,"Let me start off this letter saying I don't like you 
 Scared of you, but I will fight you 
 I stare at the ceiling and think about you 
 Curiosity killing me, thinking of when I'ma meet you 
 You introduced yourself to so many others, mothers, sisters and brothers 
 Children and babies, drive me crazy, I wonder 
 Why you love people that love people that do right? 
 Is it rocket science to you, or is it just your type? 
 One of my biggest fears 
 Is waking up four in the morning and gotta hear you met one of my peers 
 Or maybe a family member that you thought was cool 
 Or maybe a person that I'll never meet cause of you 
 You, son of a bitch, and I wish you never existed 
 And I swear I'd blow your brains out if you paid me a visit 
 But that's not realistic, 'cause you'll never write 
 But I'ma still send this letter off, P.O. Box 
 And when you get it 
 Please take it personal 
 Please take it personal 
 Please take it personal 
 Because it's personal 
 Let me continue this letter saying I don't like you 
 I'm scared of you, but I will fight you 
 Should be ashamed of the moves you make 
 The pain you bring, the sorrow and the hearts you break 
 Every day you remind me that you're always there 
 Cause every time I come around, someone's getting shot down 
 And all I say is a prayer, so help me Lord 
 Then the Lord talk back, I can't help you boy 
 That's fucked up, my luck's fucked, was cursed before birth 
 And what's fucked up, I gotta live my life with the hurt 
 Of knowing that you're everlasting, dwelling upon the masses 
 Of the earth, fatal assassins snatch your bodies 
 Probably, on my notepad as I write 
 Why the fuck you wanna take my life? 
 Sooner or later, I'm tired and weary and my gray hairs are not in my favor 
 So when I write on this paper, it's real talk, so 
 (Kendrick Lamar as 'Death' (screwed vocals)) 
 Let me start off this letter saying I don't like you too 
 And the reason why we haven't met because I've been busy dude 
 But ever since grade school I watched your every move 
 You slipped up a few times 
 I gave you a pass, so don't say I ain't sympathetic 
 But you can bet it, your curiosity, I'ma dead it 
 Everybody wanna know why I act this way 
 Let's just say, I had a bad day 
 Matter of fact everyday, gotta take it out on somebody 
 And you could probably find me wherever the wolves parade 
 I was born to be a killjoy, I'm a old brat 
 Conceived by Adam and Eve, so who you mad at? 
 Not me, see me, I'm just doing my job 
 And you ducking me is mos def an odd 
 So why send this letter as if I never knew you? 
 I'd rather knock on your door and just give it to you 
 (Ab-Soul talking) 
 It's everywhere, the streets, the corners 
 The coroners, the morgues 
 Cemeteries, hospitals 
 Heard about 'em when I was little 
 Tomorrow's not promised 
 Cause any day he can be knocking at your front door 
 War, genocide, homicide 
 Suicide, all coincide 
 Signed and sealed by the living 
 Make it, don't take it"

 Finish line with the tire marks 
 When the relay starts I'm a runaway slave 
 Ugh, walking on water and running on waves 
 God MC Oh my God you gotta see 
 There's never no I's in me 
 Of an Odyssey, I'm a block away 
 Fire marshal's moving in 
 Marshmallows inside my pen 
 Sweet sixteens 
 Got a sweet sixteen and they deadlier than sin 
 I'm so appalled 
 I'm the prototype with a godly protocol 
 You an amateur, they wanna pro to call 
 I damage ya on camera, in Compton, in Canada 
 I don't care where ya are 
 Just blink twice and I'm there where you are 
 Like a shadow in the dark, you a paddle in the boat 
 In an ocean full of sharks bout to come up short 
 Water in the pot, flow crack rock like Bam Bam nigga 
 Have two grams nigga pay up or blam blam nigga 
 Had a black Camry, bumpin' Dipset, Killa Cam nigga 
 I had been around niggas, killas, pimps 
 You ain't been around shit but your momma and your bitch 
 Jumped off the porch when I was like six 
 Uncle Bobby got the house raided back in 9-6 
 Kick in the door 
 K9's all in the kitchen way before I even heard of Mike Vick 
 Momma in the bathroom poppa at work 
 Happened on Sunday we shoulda went to Church 
 Look at my shirt, Polo on it 
 It's gon' sell if my logo on it 
 I fear no opponent 
 A demon come near and I might throw a spear at the omen

 I'mma shot like a H3, H-U-B-C-I-T-Y, A-B and Y-G 
 Problem and Hootie nigga 
 Tell the government come shoot me, nigga 
 'Cause I'm going out with a fist raised 
 And a fist full of money give it to a fifth grade 
 Drink a fifth of Hennessy and then take another fade 
 With a democratic politician from CA 
 They don't wanna see a B-L-A-C-K 
 Making some scratch like a hall of fame DJ 
 Give us some free J's put us in PJ's 
 Now we in the county jail calling for a three-way 
 God-Damn, y'all cold 
 Mark of the beast wear your god damn bar-code 
 Stuck in the street where it's dark like Harpo 
 Black man tell me where your God-Damn heart go 
 Although I'm in the land of milk and honey 
 Nobody never gave me shit, when I got my first chain 
 All the niggas tried to take it from me 
 I had to fight back and shit 
 Get it back and shit 
 And you rap niggas looking funny tryna talk back and shit 
 Like he back that shit 
 Acting like you real or something 
 Nigga ain't popped no steel, ain't popped no collar 
 Go pop some pills or something 
 You trying real hard to appeal to someone 
 I'm being myself, my BFF is a BM-dub 
 With your BM in it and your stash box glove 
 And a medicine a doctor gave a nigga won't help 
 I'm at the limit where I be amazing myself 
 I bet I finish on a level with a Black belt 
 I bet I hit it where every rapper get killed, like 
 Bla bla bla bla where the knife at? 
 Cut cut cut where your life at? 
 Your careers over, he's slumped over 
 And if I'm off beat know I'm un-sober 
 That's a new flow 
 Pl-, Plus Q gave me some Kush and some Nuvo 
 New dough for the new year and I sumo on a rap peer 
 Not a rapper, I'm a raptor 
 That's a T-Rex in a V-neck for the rapture 
 I'm a factor and your facial 
 I will fracture to a fraction 
 No one-half and I hate math

 Low the bisquits let's go to distance 
 I'm blow and listen my car how why you with a broke ignition 
 They so suspicious, low and vicious with no convictions 
 Juries making their own decisions they want us to go to prison 
 Cold adrenaline I got this soul like a poet's living 
 So is spitting it's like I'm co-existent to prohibition 
 I'm a dressin critics who say these widows the best as spit it 
 Disrespect the spirit, or the artist who rap with lyrics 
 Mother of statistics they rap with metaphysics 
 And they yeah simplistic, they stay out as repetition

 Since I made it the city hated, wait, where is the love? 
 I ride around with my gun, this is not for fun 
 I stay protected cause my homie just took one to the lung 
 Had him on life support, where's the family support? 
 He knew who shot him, but he ain't even show up in court

 I'ma keep the pussy wet

 My dick hard, her pussy wet 
 (Kendrick Lamar - Verse 1) 
 And I'm born with my dick in the earth, you can tell me how much am I worth 
 I'ma die with my heart on my sleeve, many die on their hands and their knees 
 And I'm takin' whatever I need, and I'm rapin' the government fees 
 And you're wastin' your time, and I'm speakin' my mind on whatever I think 
 And I think that I'm Richard Pryor with priors of 32 fiends 
 And that means that I here fly higher, tell me why are you starin' at me? 
 Matta fact, man, your eyes is wired, you inspired by Kendrick the king 
 Maybe it's 'cause I'm livin' my dream, man, I sing what I'm livin' about 
 And the words that come out of my mouth, they requires a random routine 
 Of being organic granite, then my access is granted 
 To represent the shit that I conceive, and I guarantee that I'ma bring 
 My mind, body, soul and I sold all these records off bein' myself 
 And I wish you can do the same thing, man, it's easier than a stripper 
 Or tyin' a baby shoestring, you stringing along 
 And really why you writing a song? Your passion for music is never in sync 
 No secret societies guided me to the world of unseen 
 And they tell me life is a bitch, who gives a shit? You can believe 
 I'ma keep the pussy wet (Yep) 
 I'ma keep the pussy wet (Yep) 
 My-my dick hard, her pussy wet 
 I'ma keep the pussy wet (Yep)

 And I see that you envy of me, enemy ghosts don't prosper 
 Better yet, they do die eventually, if I'm at the event you will leave 
 'Cause you know and I know that I go ham even if Muslims is seen 
 In my rearview I'm near you, but I don't hear you, can you hear this breathe? 
 Wit' an oxygen mask, and the masses keep sayin' I'm speakin' for them 
 And if you can imagine my madness, then you can see where I've been 
 And the places the Louis has been, and I swear I been doin' this when 
 You was in pajamas, watchin' B-B-Barney a-and Friends 
 And you couldn't harm me even with ten, weapons of your choice ridin' in 
 Army tanks, you shot blanks, and I shot back, make your duplex bend 
 What the fuck you think? If I don't think, then I'm right back where the city sin 
 What the fuck you drink? Thinkin' I can't write these raps in the Lions' Den 
 When I hear that you lyin', then? It's murder, she wrote, ain't no hope 
 You go downhill, man, where's your slope? Get thrown downhill tied to a rope 
 Told the world to put intervals, man, I swear this the Hannibal 
 And they tell me that life is a bitch, who gives a shit when you know? 
 And I see that you envy of me-me-me-me-me 
 Don't prosper, better yet, they do die eventually-ly-ly 
 'Cause you know and I know that I go ham even if Muslims is seen 
 In my rearview I'm near you...

 Life make a n-gga wanna yell out, 
 Change for the fame, how n-ggas turn sell out, 
 Too old for my mama crib I'm tryin' to get the hell out, 
 Stayin out these cells but we working on that bail out, 
 Help out... please, it sure is hard livin' without cheese, 
 Ain't shit in my pocket only these house keys, 
 They pray for a n-gga but yet they doubt me 
 That's why I'm out getting higher than bel-vees, 
 But no I won't jump, being broke is childish you know I'm grown up 
 My money runnin' late tho so boy I won't front, 
 When my paper finally make it you should know I'm gonna stunt 
 So, hard 
 My God, my life is such? 
 Can't save me tonight cause times is hard now 
 I know you tell me don't let my guard down 
 I gotta get it my n-gga 
 Never believe what they say 
 Man, I gotta get paid 
 ? 
 Yo I'ma shock the World 
 I'ma shock the World 
 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 Stare inside of the soul of Kendrick 
 While I stare inside the solar... system 
 Hopin' I soak up enough game to play 3 systems with one controller and remain sane and remain unsober 
 Was Closer To My Dreams but reality actually told me hold up 
 No money in my jeans and my salary said ""you owe us"" 
 Can't pay them taxes, laid on that matress and feel colder than a polar bear 
 But this bear was in California 
 So I felt out a pocket and a piece of lint fell out my pocket 
 A broke opportunist all in my optics 
 You could see it even when I'm Sleep 
 My screw's loose, I hate when loose change fall in them seats 
 Because I need every dime like Magic Johnson or Hugh Hefner living in his prime 
 Prime example of youngin' on his grind 
 This the life of a Compton n-gga 
 I know the vanities of the World like the promise n-ggas 
 That's why we crooked in yo bushes where you find us n-gga You better scramble before you fold like an omelet n-gga 
 This ain't insomnic n-gga and that means I don't need Busters to front on me 
 A Bible in my pocket I'm walkin' like it's a gun on me 
 So when I catch a Fed they know to put more than one on me 
 Fear No Evil, I can still see Regals pullin' up 
 N-ggas tuck like a baby in fetal... Position 
 If you listen you can hear the City needs you 
 That's what my mind said 
 But my big head is tellin' me that I'm a Black Beetle 
 Until my number is called and someone yell Bingo 
 A shadow in the Dark, Park The Coupe 
 Then Re-Coop with the homeless in the park, Kendrick Lamar"

 Who could it be? K-I-D 
 Searching all day in the streets for DMT 
 Don't sip it, though it couldn't answer 
 Drip, drip all day bumpin' MGMT, homie 
 Watch who you hate on, fam', without the facts 
 Sad niggas back in the hood bumpin' Ratatat 
 To me it was a dream, a fiend to understand that 
 You never seen a nigga like me? 
 I just tell 'em I'm an oxymoron when I open my mouth 
 Cause people talk shit before knowing what I'm about 
 But for sure these Cleveland boys is ill 
 But pretty soon your gutter bitches wildin' for real, it's such a trip 
 Hoes around the globe, I'm known to have a fet' 
 I don't do a thing and these bitches lickin' they lips 
 Me and Chip reflect on all the hate and jibber jabber 
 Mmm, you almost got me, but sucker I'm not a sucker 
 Better get on back 
 You pussy motherfuckers get the Will Smith smack 
 And I am not a fronter, better look up the facts

 Mr. Rager, Solo Dolo see me and repeat it 
 Come, come now, last call, who want some? 
 It's just me, two bitches and dirty drums 
 Two lips to kiss, 22 other nuns 
 God blessed my tongue, God need it for life 
 Awkward like car rides, twiddling my thumbs 
 Pondering my next accomplishments 
 It's condescending to say I won 
 Two lips, you kiss my ass tonight, huh? 
 I really want it I need it 
 Break bread or break fast 
 Before I blast and break legs, ride past 
 And they scream out ""little Johnny is dead!"" 
 You wish me well, I wish you hell 
 Eternity, no such thing as time will tell 
 Infirmary, burn like magnetic combustion 
 Bad credit with me, and paramedics are hustlin' 
 What's the definition of water? 
 Sherm sticks, simply got 'em everywhere you caught us 
 Turn quick, I don't wanna play this for my daughter 
 And if my son heard it, probably look at you as his father 
 I'm proud of myself in a bad way 
 Halfway house, tell that to me halfway 
 I'm passin' out, ass whoopin' 
 Your ass lookin' for Michelle Obama 'til I bang on you 
 They couldn't 
 Come, come now, last call, who want some?

123,Kendrick Lamar,hiphop,Street Dreamin,"Wrote my goodbye letter today 
 With conviction in every stroke 
 Licked the envelope and sent it away 
 Wanted to do it the old fashioned way 
 Didn't want no text or tweeting 
 Wanted him to feel every word that I say 
 Boy I hope these tears I cry 
 On the paper don't dry 
 Before it make it to your side 
 I want you to know what it feels like 
 When your heart is done I'm so tired 
 I hope when he reads these words 
 This hurt I feel bleeds through 
 Before the ink dry 
 I want you to know what it feels like 
 When your heart is done 
 I'm so tired 
 So I need you to 
 Hurry hurry please Mr. mailman 
 Overnight it if you can 
 I need you to feel me, feel me 
 This is a special delivery 
 Hurry hurry now before I take it back 
 Before he cleans up his act 
 I need you to feel me, feel me 
 This is a special delivery 
 Got me saying oh, special delivery 
 This is a special delivery 
 Funny how words take a life on their own 
 When you said you love me 
 That's what I believed 
 But I was so wrong baby 
 Boy in your arms I never felt more alone 
 But now that I got me back 
 Got my heart on track 
 I'm moving on"

 Often I'm caught up in confusion and need a dissolution 
 They tell me the solution is get through the illusion I'm living 
 A few friends killed, a few sent to prison 
 Our mama's tried to warn us but few tend to listen 
 See we running the streets in search of some trouble 
 At least a couple of freaks to sneak home with 
 Now she ride a n-gga dick just like she owned it 
 So every time I wanna hit, I bet ya she owned it 
 She got the bad lips, bad hips, damn shawty 
 Slim waist, Gina face, Pam body 
 Met her in the club, yet I look her to (?) love 
 That's the reason my n-ggas can't find me 
 Good golly, look shawty, ain't no need for games 
 I know a n-ggas still young but I done seen some things 
 If it's cool to talk, let me ease ya pain 
 This is food for thought, let me feed ya brain 
 Your ex-man did you dirty, did he leave a stain? 
 When them losers talk, tell 'em please refrain 
 I refuse to stop, don't freeze the frame 
 Cause tonight I got you calling out Jesus name

 Seeking the devil stone getting repetitive (?) I know 
 But shawty body and she admire that I'm a pyro-maniac 
 I say where you at and do you have Geico? 
 I need insurance that you could sex me the best 
 And she start sexing through text and send pictures under her dress 
 Got them G-Strings, you beasting for the pleasure and pain 
 I was a weakling so I cling to her under my name 
 I gave her the ding ding than dee ding, the bell ring in the game 
 It was intriging that she seemed to no stand, no flow 
 Keeping it wet, making it rain 
 Beg ya pardon, don't blow job, she no jobs like Tommy from Martin (?) 
 Don't blow jobs, she blow hard like a Nintendo cartridge 
 That blow job had (?) like Mozart 
 Got blow job than put it in her trunk like go ya (?) 
 I'm starving offa that Cuervo 
 Shop on Rodeo, house in the dagos

 It's just textbook stuff 
 It's in the ABC, of growin' up 
 Three women raised me 
 Famous Footwear paid me not enough to blow up 
 But showed up 'cause I ain't fuckin' lazy 
 And teachers thought I was dumb or crazy 
 Or both 
 With hopes of being a Nas or Jay-Z 
 I slumped, in my chair and my grades 
 My head wasn't raised 
 Being fly was priority to the lowest 
 I would stand on my desk just to see the world in a different way 
 The dead society of a poet 
 Homie I'm focused 
 But there's something that a dude can't prove 
 I mean fam, I was damn near invisible at school 
 So I banged for a minute 
 Cause all my niggas was crippin' 
 Just me and my two of my dudes, blue man crew 
 Had dreams of doing things they say that you can't do 
 Cause everything ain't black and white, 'less you chew bamboo 
 So I was after big bills like a toucan do 
 All the while my mom askin' why I'm truant at school 
 She said 
 Uh, So why ain't I go to college 
 My mommas ultimatum made me say that I know I got it 
 My niggas said V's buggin' 
 Stay on your computer software, debugging 
 But we holding hardware 'cause we thuggin' 
 Now they in the trap-house with some guns that they done borrowed 
 And all this snow, I call it Infant Sorrow 
 With plans to reach the end even if I had to star slow 
 Sold CDs in the mall, making dough like Sbarro 
 Then I left the hood, like fuck it don't need the cargo 
 They banking I don't do well, and I don't mean Fargo 
 But even when you leave, somehow it still try to follow 
 Baby brother took a charge harder than LeBron and Rondo 
 Trying to keep his head up while his eyes are in the Bible 
 'Cause they say a mind that's idle is a devil's toy aisle 
 My nephew looking at me cause his daddy is his idol 
 I looked at him, told him sit down 
 This information is vital, look 
 Living my life like I'm living right 
 In the midst of a fire pit 
 The gang-banging and violence, is the sweetest song 
 And I roam with the heart of a violin 
 Don't violate my patience I'm waiting, to kill a man 
 As I stare at the ceiling fan, as a fan of these wicked streets 
 If I gotta eat, I steel like a metal piece 
 I'm screamin' out fuck the police 
 I'm dealing my cards with Jokers on em 
 You can disown him or stone him 
 I'm throwing them rocks back, with the fury of bullets 
 You couldn't live your life for the moment 
 When I'm foamin' at the mouth 
 And my sharpest of teeth showin' 
 I'm in the back of a black Buick 
 Finna black out, like February 
 Ain't that how Black's do it, right 
 I cut off my ears before I hear your advice and vice versa 
 I'm screaming for help, as loud as I can but that's not working 
 I'm working them corners like blueprints 
 Then caught an L on my first offence 
 The judge threw the book at me 
 And said this"

 I do it for the love of hip hop and the love of bitches 
 Am I a hypocrite because everyday I'm contradicting 
 I think of how I'm living, then I watch how I'm living 
 I know this can't be right 
 My conscience tell me to stay righteous 
 It's unlikely to see what I what I like and say I don't like it 
 Biggest dilemma 
 My priorites ignoring me 
 I want to move accordingly but baby steps are premature, remember 
 I'm flying to the South and I'll be gone till November 
 To see my family tree but this a shame, I'm yelling out timber 
 Word around town I'm all about the bitches 
 Word around town that I love me 26's 
 Word around town that I gotta stay paid 
 Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave 
 (Gucci Mane) 
 It's the Gucci, cock and shoot 
 Found my swag but lost my roof, burr 
 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave 
 (Gucci Mane) 
 See my Audemar tick, that's my Audemar tock 
 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave 
 Cold, oh so cold 
 How ironic, he bought it then sold his soul 
 Is it masonic for your vice to take its toll 
 The remo (?) control is taking control 
 Lift up the doors 
 That lamborghini 
 I want to come with a dumbass model that invokes (?) 
 I like 'em both 
 I wife 'em both 
 Take these motherfucking jordans off, put on my loafs 
 Cause nothing goes bad every time I wear gucci 
 I'm getting more ass every time I wear gucci 
 They tell me it's a fad 
 Every time I wear gucci 
 But shit, I give a fuck when it bring me more coochie 
 This a young nigga's pedigree, I pray the lord can better me 
 If not, he bout to strike me down like this my third felony 
 The voices keep telling me, 
 Kendrick, don't forget about us 
 I burned my wardrobe hoping that I could live without it 
 Word around town I'm all about the bitches 
 Word around town that I love me 26's 
 Word around town that I gotta stay paid 
 Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave 
 (Gucci Mane) 
 It's the Gucci, cock and shoot 
 Found my swag but lost my roof, burr 
 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave 
 (Gucci Mane) 
 See my Audemar tick, that's my Audemar tock 
 (Kendrick Lamar) 
 Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave"
129,Kendrick Lamar,hiphop,We Up,"I'm around the bullshit like a matador 
 I'm used to the bullshit, it don't matter, boy 
 Corporate acquisitions, accumulations of wealth 
 Build with the gods and double knowledge of self 
 Entrepreneur visions, Moulin Rouge religion 
 That pussy make a weak nigga break down 
 So what you want, the cheese or the chicks' 
 You want the chicks but you want the cheese 
 A bitch gotta eat 
 I'm havin' the epiphany you niggas ain't shit to me 
 Worse than the scum in the slum I'm from 
 I'm a southside nigga, yeah I'm 'bout mine 
 You be that next nigga coroners come and outline 
 You ain't made of what I'm made of 
 You a bum nigga with a bum bitch 
 Your shoes come from Vegas 
 Counterfeit, fraudulent fakers 
 What kind of rich nigga bitch look like that 
 You all know when we pullin' off the lot 
 Brake, hit the button, then we pullin' down the top 
 Shine's on stuntin' and I'm pullin' out a knot 
 Strapped with the glock, won't pull it out a lot 
 But front, I'll make it pop 
 Y'all don't do it how we do 
 Niggas ain't on the shit we on 
 Everything new 
 Spikes on the Louis Vuittons 
 We up, nigga! 
 Visualize everything I needed and dream (uh-huh) 
 Penalized every ho nigga that have a scheme (what else?) 
 Guns in your video get you locked in a bing 
 Yeah, I kill a nigga quick, no worries, my record clean 
 Murder one become manslaughter as soon as they brought up 
 Charity work, parking tickets and no charges 
 Fuck nigga you fucked over your father when he gave you a dick 
 Should have been a bitch in pajamas 
 I made my first million fucking dollars 
 Bought a Bible, oh yeah, God got me 
 Made my second million dollars, bought a chopper and a binocular 
 I'm scared, this shit don't happen to everybody 
 I'm on Instagram looking at your favorite singer 
 Debating on should I fuck her or jump on her single 
 20 thou, she got a hell of a adlib 
 I'm in her mouth like I knew I could have kids, K-Dot 
 Good pussy for dinner, bomb kush for breakfast 
 Deep-colored VS stones around my neck bitch 
 It feels like a nigga dreamin' 
 Seat back, music bumpin', niggas leanin' 
 Bulls eye, that's what we came for 
 The bread, now a nigga run the game boy 
 I should've sent the broad to report what's in the yard 
 Aloof livin', I came up so hard 
 No pain, no gain, it's embedded in the brain 
 I'm in it for the grip, motherfuck the fame"
130,Kendrick Lamar,hiphop,Who's House,"Whose house is this? Money out the ... can't count that shit 
 Stacking death prez, mouth to mouth that shit 
 When they said a nigga wouldn't amount to shit 
 Now whose house is this? Laughing so hard my tongue is out and shit 
 Run you dick suckers, keep me out that bitch 
 Before I spazz and squirt and I'm out that bitch 
 Broadcasting live from south central Los Angeles 
 Where the babies born scandalous 
 The street I keep my hand in it 
 The gun I keep my hand on it 
 Niggas is going to need bandages 
 If I brandish it ambulances, the chance you make it slim nigga 
 I'm good in the hood 'cause I motivated them niggas 
 I graduated from dumb hoes and mault liquor 
 To expensive wine and dime bitches 
 Red lining the DB9 like it's my time pimping 
 Audemar [?] quality time spending 
 And you niggas is borderline bitches 
 That's my opinion 
 And my niggas is ride or die Aftermath my religion 
 Talk out but I don't listen 
 Act out and come up missing 
 That click clack pow did it 
 Like Colin Powell did it 
 And I'm so west coast, ok corral with it 
 My new foreign car can't pronounce that shit 
 You fuck around count that shit 
 Broadcasting live from Compton California where foreigners never come 
 Mothers are worry some and we diss like the governor 
 I hope these angels can cover us 
 If the LAPD ain't doing it then it was a cover up 
 Coroners about to cover up everybody 
 I'm serious, every shotty is saw'd off 
 And every nigga is militant 
 And your gut like... What? 
 EBT Cards, no credit can't ease cards 
 All my life beed OG aw now my life on the billboard soon 
 Give me room, I react like a wildebeest and 
 Throw salt inside your wound your just diabetes to me 
 Ain't shit sweet with these hotels homie 
 That crop shit got my uncle's life in jail ho 
 So if I put the same line, they'll never forgive me 
 Or worse than that the niggas right around the corner might kill me 
 I'm fighting back when it's hard what 
 No barber my guards up, the author of fallen fathers that did it without much, this my house nigga"
131,Kendrick Lamar,hiphop,XXL Freshman,"I return before tables get turned 
 It's my turn, spur of the moment 
 They re-produce my sperm and try to clone it, stand firm 
 Bumping The Firm, Phone Tap, I'm on it 
 I slaughter every opponent to bits of components, potent 
 You can't fuck with the horse power, your woofing too much 
 Y'all bout to hoarse coward, as soon as I buss, pause 
 You put your hands on a broad and telling me you can brawl 
 You thought you saw me when you saw Saw, frightening 
 More reckless than a ? driving without a license 
 Hittin' your new truck then leaving you hiking 
 They said no, the industry let it go 
 I cracked the window then hit the back door like trick dices 
 Stickin' and movin and movin' and stickin' the prices 
 Uppin' the ante before my ante can promise you hear me clear 
 Even if you eat 3 ears with Tyson 
 Rippin' the panties but bootin' the wammys 
 They dyke and I'm liking them all, I'm siftin' through panties 
 Haters'll spike it 
 Voicing opinions but holding laryngitis 
 But I don't hear 'em, I'm a winner by law 
 Track 'em down like the subway when they sub-par 
 Sub-zero every time I jump in the send the Gods, 
 Send the angels, send the God 
 I can make you look hard, I know 
 I just let the thoughts take its toll 
 More sentences than level four of y'all, Bogard 
 Go hard, black tar, concrete, Tom Vick times Papi Mason times 3 
 Uncle Toms need toms to stomach atomic bombs 
 Or die from my Wizardry 
 Rza, Gza, Method man 
 I'm a killer b, killer! Be killed, make your embassy yield 
 This is not your cup of tea, and oh 
 They say waters run deep, dive in, Bermuda triangles 
 And you will see us, we must leave dust behind 
 Emcee's duck, deduct, revenue declined 
 When we touch down like a Running Back's grind 
 Can you keep up and keep us safe for keepsake 
 That ain't safe, 
 Compton!"
132,Kendrick Lamar,hiphop,Yolo,"Yolo 
 YOLO, you only live once 
 The battle cry of a generation 
 This life is a precious gift 
 So don't get too crazy 
 It's not worth the risk 
 You know that we are still young 
 So don't be dumb 
 Don't trust anyone 
 Cause you only live once 
 Ugh, you only live once 
 That's the motto 
 So take a chill pill 
 Ease off the throttle 
 Never go to loud clubs 
 'Cause it's bad for your ears 
 Your friends will all be sorry 
 When they can't hear 
 And stay the hell away from drugs 
 'Cause they're not legal 
 Then bury all your money in the backyard 
 Like a beagle 
 'Cause you should never trust a bank 
 They've been known to fail 
 And never travel by car, a bus 
 Boat or by rail 
 And don't travel by plane 
 And don't travel at all 
 Built a bomb shelter basement 
 With titanium walls 
 And wear titanium suits 
 In case pianos fall on ya 
 And never go in saunas 
 'Cause they're crawlin' with piranhas 
 And never take the stairs 
 'Cause they're often unsafe 
 You only live once 
 Don't let it go to waste 
 You know that we are still young 
 So hold off on the fun 
 Cook your meat till it's done 
 Cause you only live once 
 Yeah 
 And here's another piece of advice 
 Stay away from kids 
 Cause their hair is filled with mad lice 
 There's no such thing 
 As too much Purell 
 This a cautionary tale 
 Word to George Orwell 
 So don't 1980 force 
 Any plugs into sockets 
 Always wear a chastity belt 
 And triple lock it 
 Then hire a taster 
 Make him check your food for poison 
 And if you think your mailman is a spy 
 Then destroy him 
 No blankets or pajamas 
 They can choke you in your sleep 
 Two words about furniture 
 Killing machines 
 Board your windows up 
 The sun is bad for your health 
 And always wear a straight jacket 
 So your safe from yourself 
 Take no chances (no chances) 
 Stop freelancin' (right now) 
 Invest in your future 
 Don't dilute your finances (uh huh) 
 401K, make sure it's low risk 
 Then get some real estate (how much?) 
 4.2% thirty year mortgage 
 That's important, that's a great deal 
 And if you can't afford it 
 Don't forge it on your last bill 
 Renting is for suckers right now 
 A dependable savings 
 And you'll retire with money in your account 
 Beast 
 YOLO, say no no 
 Isolate yourself 
 And just roll solo 
 Be care-folo 
 You oughta look out 
 Also stands for YOLO 
 You know that we are still young 
 Burn the prints off your thumbs 
 Then pull out all your teeth 
 So you can't bite your tongue 
 Only on this earth for a short time, time 
 So don't go outside, cause you don't want to die, die 
 Just take our advice and hide 
 And scream YOLO to the sky 
 You oughta look out"
