0,Necrophagist,metal,Foul Body Autopsy,"Snorting - the viley stench of putrescence 
 Coffin - lies exhumed in front of me 
 Foul stiff - strewn with papillae and pores 
 Fermenting - stiff corpse putrefies 
 Slicing, bisecting, incising the stiff 
 Stomach wall is opening 
 Primitive diagnosis... 
 Remove internal organs 
 Primitive autopsy... 
 Slicing, bisecting, incising the stiff 
 Sawing - the weak head of the corpse I saw 
 Slicing - celebral bisection 
 Eviscerate - slushy bowels ripped out at once 
 Perfecting - foul body autopsy

1,Necrophagist,metal,To Breathe In A Casket,"Eyes opened up within the moist and dark 
 Trapped inside the measures of a coffin 
 Horrified awakening, blank fears embrace me 
 Oh... beyond... 
 ...Beyond these walls there lies infinity... 
 Asphyxiation is imminent due to the measures 
 Of this confinement 
 Blind hits against the coffin walls, 
 Blank fears control me 
 Oh... beyond... 
 ...Beyond these walls there lies infinity... 
 To breathe in a casket 
 Six feet below... 
 To breathe in a casket 
 Below... 
 Buried deep beneath the earth, beneath the earth... 
 Blank fears embrace me, embrace me... 
 Buried six feet below, six feet below... 
 Blank fears control me, control me... 
 Breathing inside a casket... 
 Breathing inside a casket... 
 Breathing inside a casket...

2,Necrophagist,metal,Mutilate The Stillborn,"Dismembering - to chop her body I begin 
 Bastard - bastard inside 
 Disfiguring - abdominal wall is opening 
 Offal - come to sight 
 Malintention, to chop the foetus I intent, 
 Hateful am I 
 Vile malodours, rancid odours I perceive 
 I'm getting high 
 Hate and repulsion is that 
 Which strenghtens my intent 
 Fetal incising causes premature decease 
 Loathing am I to commit 
 Infanticide in unborn state 
 To tear out the foetus, my aggressions do increase 
 Mutilate the stillborn 
 Dismanteling - excoriate the dead unborn 
 Vile waste - vile waste inside is 
 Festering - prenatal fluids I adore 
 Offal - come to sight 
 Mutilation, the stillborn body chopped in half, 
 Hateful am I 
 Disemboweling, the torso drained of tepid bowels 
 I'm getting high 
 Hate and repulsion is that 
 Which strenghtens my intent 
 Fetal incising causes premature decease 
 Loathing am I to commit 
 Infanticide in unborn state 
 To tear out the foetus, my aggressions do increase 
 Mutilate the stillborn"
3,Necrophagist,metal,Intestinal Incubation,"Worms in microscopic size 
 Infest dermatic pores, 
 They move through blood 
 Parasitic organisms move seeking path 
 To hepatic tissue they are heading forth, 
 Their larvae to breed 
 In the precious warmth 
 Of the liver they multiply...

4,Necrophagist,metal,Culinary Hyperversity,"Hateful I'm slashing, the head is removed 
 Removing the head of the corpse 
 The throat down the hard chest the trunk is torn 
 Tearing the trunk of the corpse... 
 Disintegrating the stiff limb by limb 
 Performing deviant butchery 
 I chop up the limbs into small handy chunks 
 In my own way of sick butchery 
 I rip out the entrails, cut through pulsating flesh 
 Into the torso I grasp, deep, to tear out the rest 
 I divide into that which like and which not 
 Nutritious organs stored, the rest left to rot... 
 ...Rot... 
 Wrathful I'm hacking the organs are minched 
 Minching the flesh of the stiff 
 Imagine the bodyparts served on a plate, 
 Prepared by sick culinary...

5,Necrophagist,metal,Advanced Corpse Tumor,"To see the interior of a dark coffin 
 What is it like to be inside dead...? 
 Is there something that I might perceive, 
 Or is it lost in infinity...? 
 Viley maggots swarm within stale pus, 
 Accelerating the rate of putridity... 
 Thought patterns preserved in energetic form 
 Or is it all lost in infinity...? 
 Viley maggots swarm within stale pus, 
 Accelerating rate of putridity... 
 ...Fierce... 
 Is there something that I might live, 
 Or is it all lost in nothingness...? 
 ...Fierce... 
 Weakened tissue starts rapidly to degrade 
 Under progressive foulness 
 Former vital organs are replaced 
 By a clumb of corpse tumors... 
 Is that what expects us in the deep, 
 Just corpse tumors...?

6,Necrophagist,metal,Extreme Unction,"The light is fading without any halt 
 Expiration is now imminent, pain...

7,Necrophagist,metal,Fermented Offal Discharge,"The casket is exhumed, turfs piled beside the grave 
 A stagnant mass awaits me, deep in the gloom 
 The boxes lids I open, distraught desecrating 
 The fumes are penetrating, I am eructating-...I vomit... 
 I initiate... eager exhuming despite bad scents 
 I dig up cold earth, exhumed turfs I disperse 
 I initiate... eager exhuming despite bad scents 
 The open casket reveals the rot 
 Into weak stomach I slide my hands 
 Intensifying fumes I like to snort... 
 Colon and small intestine, 
 Sliced and ripped out of the foul body 
 Duodenum I minch, 
 All should be treated equal 
 Rotten stool and urine, 
 Spurt out of fermented organs 
 I discharged and raped 
 Putrefied giblets disembowel... 
 Decrepit spleen and pancreas I've torn and gutted 
 I eviscerate stomach and cysts 
 Liver is torn and twisted, turning inside out 
 A fermented offal discharge, disembowel... 
 Evacuated offal hastily wrapped in bags 
 As basic for my culinary... 
 ...Putrefied internal fragments... 
 ...Fermented offal discharge... 
 ...Putrefied internal fragments... 
 ...Fermented offal discharge..."
8,Necrophagist,metal,Stabwound,"Invisible blades penetrate 
 Whereas stabwounds are not detectable.

 Attacks led by the ones one used to trust.

9,Necrophagist,metal,The Stillborn One,"A life free of guilt exists when 
 The eye fights daylight yet unseen. 
 A book with not a page written 
 Means hope yet sometimes to be 
 (The) Stillborn One. Born dead. 
 (The) Stillborn One. Dead. 
 When dawn and sunset coincide, 
 The essence of a day is non-existent, 
 Lifeless... 
 Dehydrated soils may not recover 
 From the drought they might be plagued with, 
 Prepare to be...

10,Necrophagist,metal,Ignominious & Pale,"If it is to be only 
 An element of a whole, 
 To hide behind others 
 And form the eclipse of mind. 
 Ignominious And Pale. 
 If it were to one 
 Having nothing to tell, 
 This would equal 
 A state of being the one, 
 Ignominious and pale. 
 Fallen in the abyss of indignity, 
 Doubt does not exist 
 Or come into being. Pale... 
 Incarceration of personality 
 Is the sad inception of self-denial. 
 The one that denies the inner self 
 Flees into deception.

 Incarceration of personality

11,Necrophagist,metal,Diminished To B,"Surrounded by darkness and cold 
 The mind in pain grabs for hold.

 Of thoughts is now forever gone. 
 Diminished, to be diminished. 
 The beast will be wise, feast: eye for an eye.

12,Necrophagist,metal,Epitaph,"Leaves fall in the autumn 
 Of lives that appear 
 To be worthless to some, 
 Utmost ignorant. 
 Expectations shift in the eye 
 Of the beholder... behold. 
 Tears drop from the eye 
 Of lives paled 
 As jealousy fools 
 A mind distorted. 
 Expectations shift in the eye 
 Of the beholder... behold. 
 One wishes existence 
 To be of fulfillment, 
 But leaves bend to the will 
 Of winds blowing. 
 To foresee the end 
 Of a soul... Epitaph. 
 Claim to foresee 
 The end of a soul. 
 Premature Epitaph.

13,Necrophagist,metal,Only Ash Remains,"Fear is never gone from your soul 
 That saw humiliation. 
 Being prey to the blackest of demons, 
 Paralyzed, you fail. 
 Fallen beneath

 Another soul that is doomed to fail.
