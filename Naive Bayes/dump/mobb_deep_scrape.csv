 Little nigga loco, catchin bodies on a solo 
 Props for killin' cops I'm hellbound 
 I'm on a motherfuckin mission, I'm goin' at it 
 You want a freestyle kid I'm wilder than the penile 
 Back up off me, give me room to breathe 
 And you takin' up my spot? Nigga please 
 I'm as bad as they come, there ain't nuttin good 
 Used to be a gentleman but you can call me hood 
 Matter fact, fuck that kid, you know my name

 Me and my crew, me and my crew we be chillin' and 
 Front on this and get dissed, motherfucker 
 Me and my crew, me and my crew we be chillin' and

 Ah one two, microphone check, who's next?

 Set the situation motivate your mind 
 I'ma, step ahead and not a step behind 
 Bass now come again, checkin' for the little lyrical 
 ?? And chat be milky like cereal 
 Poof I make you move when I move I bet I make you 
 Buck I make you bugged as I kick the mega flavor 
 So I'm the kid just slippin the slang 
 What's my name, what's my motherfuckin name? 
 Fight, I make a fight motherfuckin buckwild 
 Shootin niggaz up like it's goin' out of style 
 So rusty ?? sharpen up your blades 
 Load up the clip, take a sip, what's the flav 
 I roll the streets at midnight, the little terror 
 Huh, I get better by the letter 
 A true breed, head to juvenile once more 
 A twenty bag of funk, shall I say more? 
 A real lil nigga with real motherfuckin skills 
 Far from weak, so get off the fuckin' deals 
 Do the do 'cause I'ma do mines too 
 Just chillin' with my crew, peep the flavor

 Me and my crew, me and my crew we be chillin' and 
 Front on this and get dissed 
 (Prodigy) 
 Check it 
 My man Hav' got my back with the tec 20 
 To shoot 'em up if the niggaz get funny 
 My shit is real, I had to pioneer in this 
 Around the way, all the fake niggaz fear this 
 Paragraphs bust your membrane 
 On and on I bust through like teflon 
 The Little P, is not to be stepped upon 
 And if you think so kid then you're dead wrong 
 Little, far from big, yo a type small kid 
 P, I represent the brothers from Queensbridge 
 To make a long rhyme short I smoke weed 
 Sip a forty, yo fuck the court 
 So bad they tried to lock me in a group home 
 Prodigy's hard but fuck it I can rip a ?? 
 I catch wreck with the Einstein's intellect 
 And get stupid like a Stimulated Dummies mix 
 Feel the wrath, feel the aftermath 
 Even if you tooken notes, kid you couldn't pass the class 
 I keep a loosey in the chamber, cause beef got me shook down 
 Paranoid, ain't got no time to fuck around 
 So bypass the clock when it's time to go at it 
 So we can pop 'em off if the chumps want static 
 ... 
 Me and my crew, me and my crew we be chillin' and 
 Front on this and get dissed, motherfucker 
 Me and my crew, me and my crew we be chillin' and 
 Front on this and get dissed 
 (Havoc) 
 Check it 
 When I rap I kill mics like a nuke blast 
 Little Hav's the man, the man gettin' Van Damme 
 Buckwild, rockin' with much style 
 Check it as I wreck it, strip ya buttnaked 
 Pause and stand still while I just split a Phil' 
 And double up on ki's and make somethin' like a half-mil 
 Shorty's in it to get paid 
 No doubt, I got clout with the females 
 Put it in detail and write it 
 And if you ain't givin' pussy, then bitch you ain't invited 
 I'm on some other shit that you couldn't fuck with 
 Destructive, and couldn't give a fuck kid 
 Little niggaz don't die if they said so they lied 
 Immediate death to those who tried 
 The dark-skinned brother, unlike the others 
 When niggaz see my crew, they know to burn rubber"
2,Mobb Deep,hiphop,Locked In Spofford,"They got me locked in Spofford, the lil juvenile criminal 
 Two kids approach to put blades to my throat 
 They like my coat and ask me what I'm gonna do for that 
 Give it up? Huh, you don't believe that 
 So I threw on my hood, pulled out the banger 
 Swung it at the kids, that put me in danger 
 They put away them blades and said, 
 ""Why it gotta be like that?"" 
 Cause you get a little ox, and don't know how to act 
 Yeah, now I got props, and I'm runnin' shit 
 And when it comes to phone time, you don't get none of it 
 So sit back and just chill 
 Before you make a lil nigga have to get, ill 
 Only got a month left, so I gotta be on my best 
 But yet and still herb niggaz wanna put me to the test 
 So I wild, with a blade and a Kool-Aid smile 
 Let the juvenile catch wreck for a sec 
 Damn, I wish I could put my hands on a 
 Nice-ass tec, and blow a nigga to Babylon 
 But if you don't, got a knuckle game that's a damn shame 
 Nigga ? for, they got you washin drawers 
 But I refuse, 'cause I got nuttin to lose 
 Props I gotta earn, plus I gotta pay my dues 
 So in the meantime, I got a ox in my pocket 
 They got me locked in Spofford 
 Locked down, they got me locked down 
 Damn, they got me locked down 
 Locked down, they got me locked down 
 Damn, they got me locked down 
 To Spofford, and JV's worse than Rikers 
 Adolescents that ball hardcore 
 With the criminal minded juveniles 
 The real lil niggaz step out of the piles 
 And I'm not takin' no shorts while I'm up here 
 Spit 'em up, gem stars, but ain't no scars here 
 Protective custody's got mines 
 No type of help, I'm in here for self 
 And so I got locked up on a one to two 
 On the bus, catchin beef with mad crews 
 Run my shoes, fuck that, I'm goin' out kid 
 But not too buckwild, 'cause I gotta finish my bid 
 Four times, for my peoples up from the 'Bridge 
 Here, it takes a lot of heart to live 
 Behind bars, child correction 
 Trapped in the buckwild ? East section 
 They got me smokin' the death sticks 
 Niggaz got me fightin for my life, cause shit is real 
 Shorty kill a man got locked down 
 You want a buck sixty, you betta betta back down 
 On the streets a hood, but in here 
 You're up to no damn good, nigga I wish you would 
 Try to take mines, and try to shank mines 
 Shorty corrupt, there's no stoppin' me 
 Even in jail, I tear shit up 
 And when I get out, it's gonna get worse 
 The devil in the flesh 
 I'm puttin' hammers on a hearse 
 So while I'm in here, don't forget my name 
 Ain't shit changed, I'm still the motherfuckin same 
 I couldn't bitch up when I got here 
 Cell wreck, I got shit locked here 
 One more month I'm goin' Uptown 
 To the big pen, and I'ma still win 
 Cause jail is my life, and I like it here 
 Ain't no rules, you can do what you like in here 
 Jailhouse blues, I miss the ghetto 
 C.O.'s think they're five-oh's with no heat 
 So what am I to do when they step 
 Put 'em in check, and throw hands with a redneck 
 And now I got a little crew to watch my back 
 Lunchtime comes huh, you ain't gettin' none of that 
 'Cause I got shit sewn up real tight 
 Not one bit of fright, while I'm locked in Spofford 
 Locked down, they got me locked down 
 Damn, they got me locked down 
 Locked down, they got me locked down 
 Damn, they got me locked down 
 Locked down, they got me locked down 
 Damn, they got me locked down 
 Locked down, they got me locked down 
 Damn, they got me locked down"
3,Mobb Deep,hiphop,Peer Pressure,"Chorus: repeat 4X 
 The pressure... 
 (You gotta find a way to deal with) dealin' with the peer pressure 
 Verse One: Havoc 
 As a young black teen, everyday I, deal 
 With the pressure and mixed up is how I feel 
 I walk the streets with a fuck you attitude 
 And when it comes to my peoples you ain't half as rude 
 Follow the crowd or be a leader, take your pick 
 Now I'm smokin' buddha philly blunt style 
 A frustrated and confused young juvenile 
 King of the project blues so I choose 
 To take a piece of the action 
 But my sober state of mind won't let it happen 
 So twenty-four-seven it's the number one stresser 
 Dealin' with the peer pressure 
 Verse Two: Prodigy 
 Most don't understand how it is 
 In the world of today growin' up as a young black teen 
 I used to dream, of bein a architect 
 Easier said than done, believe me it's hard to get 
 Out of the projects, without forgettin where you came from 
 My parents told me from day one 
 Finish school and avoid all obstacles 
 But my environment, makes it so impossible 
 For instance, build a strong social life 
 Without messing up still trying to live right 
 Like in junior high, I used to wonder why 
 Certain females went out with certain guys 
 Then one day, it all dawned on me yo 
 You gotta be down, and have it goin' on see 
 I wasn't down with the mainstream or 
 Should I say their team, now I'm gettin' steamed 
 Gotta find a way, to get accepted by my peers 
 So now I'm sippin on beers 
 Buyin new gear, nothin' but the best 
 Forget Levi's strictly Polo and Guess 
 But how would I make the cash 
 It gotta be easy and it gotta be fast 
 Thinkin' to myself does that make me lesser 
 Just, dealin' with the peer pressure 
 Verse Three: Havoc 
 Around my way there's a kid that most don't understand 
 How he lives is it negative or positive 
 He has a grade A average 
 But when he's on the streets, with his friends, he's a savage 
 A freshman of high school, daily attendant 
 He never got in trouble never did he get suspended 
 Good little Kenny who would believe 
 He dropped out of school to start to smoke weed 
 I saw the signs but I didn't pay attention 
 Because he got offended every time that I would mention 
 The drinkin', the smokin', the low school grades 
 And sleepin' in class laid back with his black shades 
 Nowadays you catch Kenny hangin' in the hallways 
 With his crew findin more ways 
 To break out of school, and hit the block and get buckwild 
 Stay out of the way of a mad child 
 'Cause he's a product of, hell 
 Kenny never fell but he's gonna fall overall 
 So let's take a trip to the ghetto 
 Where Kenny got drunk and bought a burner off his man so 
 He pulled the trigger and the suicide note right 
 ""I'm glad it's finally over and I'm finally dead 
 And no more, do I have to feel, lesser, or 
 Deal with the peer pressure"""
4,Mobb Deep,hiphop,Skit#1,"It's about to go down real fast and quick 
 We's about to go to war with these shotties and clips 
 Somebody's gonna get murked in the streets of New York 
 I keeps it thoro because I holds down the fort 
 My nigga Ski got it under control 
 And I will not stop what I'm doing till I get to old 
 Cause the streets needs me right now to make hits 
 And represent the hood I rep on my hits 
 On a song I talk about drugs and money 
 Selling coke and watcing crackheads live bummy."

 Around the way, parlay and get high 
 My mega blast'll last in days to pass 
 Niggaz shoot, too fast, to pull out your gun last 
 That's why I like to spark first, and shoot your 
 Bitch-ass down your next ride'll be a fuckin' hearse 
 Cause little niggaz don't die son 
 Half-step and get that ass lit up like a flare gun 
 Cops they want static, whatever they can have it 
 My name is Prodigy and I'm known to cause havoc 
 And when I flip I be on some ill shit 
 I walk the street, like a real super trooper 
 The block shit proper, who once got had 
 Mad beef with the dread who sold me that dirt bag 
 Mad props to the bad little niggaz in the neighborhood 
 Long live the short, gotta hold down the fort 
 Gotta hold down the fort

 Step the fuck back, nigga, attack with the mack 
 Cause word is bond it's on 
 Shit is real around the way so sit back and take notes 
 Dead you on your coat, then cut your motherfuckin throat 
 Takin' life like a thief in the motherfuckin night 
 While I write write, you bite bite bite 
 Niggaz wanna step to my business 
 But I just parlay and sip on my Guinness 
 'Cause I'm the ripper, Mr. Flip the Scripture 
 Niggaz can't fuck with the flow of a real lil nigga 
 I wreck shop, in fact, get the mac, this is real 
 Shit is real, how the fuck you figure, nigga nil 
 So son hold me down while I pull out the glock 
 Gotta hold down the block, that's word to my pops 
 So once again it's on, light up the chalm 
 Time to drop the bomb, word is bond 
 We gotta hold down the block

 Yo son he pumpin over here Dunn?

 (Prodigy) 
 To all the niggaz that's live or real 
 You gotta hold down your block, cock back the glock 
 Fuck the cops, cause your neighborhood chores 
 If they beef, make 'em bleed on the project floors 
 I get my kicks from loadin up gun clips 
 Don't fuck with suburb chicks, I need a gangsta bitch 
 Don't need a crew, I can bust you down solo fast 
 And after that, dip into the weed stash 
 I'm quick to blast, enemies won't last the fate 
 I kill 'em fast so they can't retaliate 
 'Cause when I'm not alive who'd takes my place 
 To hold down the fort, we move on 
 My man got my back 
 I'm ready to go at anybody, who think they John Gotti 
 Peace to Manny C, good lookin' out B

6,Mobb Deep,hiphop,Bitch Ass Nigga,"Bitch ass nigga, yo it's time to pull the trigga 
 I might be small, but fuck with bein bigga 
 Niggaz wanna throw with that bullshit but step aside 
 Pull out the four-five, and kill him motherfuckin dead 
 Pump his ass with lead 
 Never fakin moves, motherfucker run the jewels 
 Buckwild, blowin' niggaz out the frame 
 Matter fact, don't call me shorty, kid you know my name 
 So next time, you see me, you better duck me 
 'Cause I don't give a fuck G 
 Catch wreck with the tec then I'm out like quick sex 
 Who's next, bitch ass nigga? 
 Bitch ass nigga - nah you don't want none (4X) 
 Kick it when I'm wicked and all smoked out 
 The little nigga that gets on your nerves so read about 
 You say yo shorty trauma, what's all the drama? 
 I shoot 'em up like their last name was Farmer 
 Shorty got the death wish, I wish to die 
 But when I try, it just goes by 
 You couldn't kill me because I can't kill myself 
 And if I got beef then I got it for self 
 And if I catch a body, I catch it for self 
 To me, murder is good for the health 
 Little man paranoid, Mr. Schizophrenic 
 Thirty-five niggaz wanna funk, don't panic 
 Just shoot a head up, or take your beatin' like a man 
 Or pull a burner if you want a longer lifespan 
 That's how I see it if I gotta die so be it 
 But maybe one day, my luck'll run out though 
 Until then, I couldn't give a FUCK yo 
 Little shorty one time, I'm goin' all out for mines 
 Cause there won't be a next time 
 So what you wanna do punk, back up a little 
 Gimme some space, I'm hittin hearts, street sweeper 
 A little crazed nigga from the streets 
 Raised in the ghetto, I'm puttin' out heads yo 
 I'm open, time to catch wreck, put 'em in check 
 Snap his neck, grab his loot then jet 
 Who's next to be a victim - easily ripped up 
 Get ready to run when I ripped em 
 Drop to the floor, feel the wrath of the drug war 
 Call me a thug who gets buck when I want more 
 Maniac react with a tec 9 
 Hit me up now cause there won't be a next time 
 Nah you don't want none 
 Bitch ass nigga - nah you don't want none (6X) 
 Who's that nigga standin with the jewels? 
 Throw on my hood, cock back the tool 
 Just to get a rep, yeah you god damn right 
 Just lick lick shots 'cause I don't fuck with fights 
 Back on the ave, and five-oh arrive 
 Chalk on the ground where the motherfucker died 
 Niggaz know who did it but ain't nobody snitchin 
 No word of to myself, if they do, I'm flippin the script 
 Settin it off, yo, put 'em in a dopefiend 
 And cut 'em up like protein 
 The Lord of criminal juvenile crimes committed 
 Set it some bitch-ass nigga, I'm widdit 
 You couldn't fuck with the skills of the five foot 
 And all it takes is a set to get your crew shook 
 You're fucked up, kid your rap styles sucks 
 I'm bustin' niggaz, like my first nut 
 Should I pull the trigga

 Bitch ass nigga - nah you don't want none (9X)"

 Juiced her up, took her to the projects 
 So uh, if she was with it maybe we could have sex

 As she starts to proceed, she said she wanted me 
 To drop a seed, I told her parlay and just be 
 Cause cunt little stunt with my butter dick shorty

 We's about to go to war with these shotties and clips 
 Somebody's gonna get murked in the streets of New York 
 I keeps it thoro because I holds down the fort 
 My nigga Ski got it under control 
 And I will not stop what I'm doing till I get to old 
 Cause the streets needs me right now to make hits 
 And represent the hood I rep on my hits 
 On a song I talk about drugs and money 
 Selling coke and watcing crackheads live bummy."
11,Mobb Deep,hiphop,Project Hallways,"Niggaz catchin bodies in the project hallways 
 Project hallways, the project hallways... 
 Project hallways, the project hallways... 
 Step in to my highrise hell 
 You gots to be on the up and up 
 Watch your back, pump your crack 
 But don't forget to re-up 
 A burner's your God and you pray to it all day 
 Then at night, you catch a body 
 But it's just the shit you got to do 
 'Cause if you wasn't watchin, they'd catch your ass too 
 You gotta go all out if you want props 
 Or you can just kill a man, and it's the same for cops 
 Now you want a little fame from the drug game 
 Whether you shoot 'em up, or pump cracks, it's all the same 
 But fuck it you're in it to win it 
 Fat uptown, cookies in the rocks, your spot's hot 
 Now you're livin' the life of a project sad song 
 Makin' your loot from all the right wrongs 
 But that's the way it goes when you choose your path 
 And you might just, feel the pain of a tec 22 blast 
 All out war, with niggaz from the next block 
 You're pullin out the glock, to shut 'em down 
 Now you're Mr. Big Shot in your tribe 
 Niggaz know your name from Mt. Vernon, to Southside 
 Comin' from the streets of Fright 
 Where the only thing you'll know is how to roll it up right 
 And load it up, tight, you're startin a block war 
 Nigga pull the trigga if you want a little more 
 Frank Nitty style, buckwild 
 Thirty-eight slugs from uptown thugs 
 No question, you're true to the game 
 Since the age of a little Brand Nubian 
 From skelly tops to props ? and all that 
 Now you're puttin' your block on the map 
 A role model to the petty drug dealers 
 Banana clip style, my neighborhood's buckwild 
 You can't forget who you came from 
 See you later maybe sooner in the project hallways 
 Project hallways, the project hallways 
 Niggaz catchin bodies in the project hallways 
 Project hallways, the project hallways 
 Niggaz catchin bodies in the project hallways 
 Project hallways, the project hallways 
 Niggaz catchin bodies 
 A little hellbound nigga, shoot 'em up, light 'em up 
 Pull the trigger, pass the 40 in the project hallways 
 Runnin' through the doorways, back in the days 
 Just a little snot nosed bastard 
 Always causin havoc, with a blade 
 But now it's a burner, used, for murder 
 Step a little closer and your ass is grass 
 You better move fast 'fore I kick that ass 
 'Cause I'm sharp like glass, but I won't break 
 Walk into the project hallways is your big mistake 
 You little bitch ass nigga, you shoulda known better 
 You'll get done, did, a kid from the 'Bridge 
 Who gets buck, and couldn't give a fuck about your daze 
 I'm talkin' 'bout the project hallways 
 Catchin bodies in the project hallways 
 Project hallways, chillin' in the project hallways 
 To survive around my way 
 You gotta play a knuckle game every day 
 Lost in the shuffle of hardrocks 
 And knocks on the streets of the uptown blocks 
 Load the glocks, who got the mox' 
 A little gun bangin' bad-ass project thug 
 You're in the wrong part of town kid 
 Mr. Buddha on the 13th floor, gimme some more 
 Sess bag it up real quick kid 
 Tap the ? shit, the brew, pass the Phil' 
 What's my name? Niggaz call me little shorty gets ill 
 And bag 'em up on the street corner 
 And bust 'em open in the project hallways 
 Check it out, yo 
 Around the way kid the sun don't shine 
 Phillie blunts kid I got what you want and it's time 
 My dialogue with the project cause motivate 
 Move, what? I never lose 
 Freestyle project hallway style 
 But the shit ain't real unless you got that buddha filled 
 Chalm, keep me goin' on when I perform 
 Charge the brain, lick 'em up, that's the name of the game 
 So it's the move when I move little smooth 
 On the motherfuckin mission and I just improve 
 Upstairs, niggaz dyin' on the 6th floor 
 Cause in the projects, shit is mad rough 
 So take a puff and relax your mind 
 J.V. crimes, most of the time 
 You might catch my crew, with a sixty-four brew 
 Watch your back, 'cause we're comin' through 
 With a fat sack of 1-2-1 son 
 And the shit ain't fun, unless I get some 
 Of the action, little shorty execute 
 I'm killin' niggaz in the hallways 
 Till there ain't no more left to shoot 
 So if you can't take the heat, stay out of the ways 
 Before you 'come a victim of the project hallways 
 Project hallways, the project hallways 
 Niggaz catchin bodies in the project hallways 
 Project hallways, the project hallways 
 Niggaz catchin bodies in the project hallways 
 Project hallways, the project hallways 
 Niggaz catchin bodies in the project hallways 
 Project hallways, the project hallways 
 Niggaz shoot 'em up in the project hallways"

 Pumpin rocks on the corner, pumpin rocks 'cause I wanna

 At my height, I'm described as a midget 
 But it ain't about height - it's about, ""Can I Kick It?"" 
 Some say I'm too little, but yo I'm too ill 
 I hit skins, light up, and then I smoke a Phil' 
 You don't want a beef with this juvenile delinquent 
 I'm not good, I'm livin' like a hood 
 And when I kick MC's abandon ship 
 Cause my brain is the sun of a solar eclipse 
 Yo, Havoc is the man that you have to bring 
 'Cause I'm flippin like pages in a Word Up magazine 
 Sweet like candy, the poetic vigilante 
 So explicit even porno flicks ban me 
 And girls gel me like jheri curl activate 
 The forty dog drinkin' money grip you're dead and stinkin 
 Brain cells overload when I'm thinkin' 
 This is a rap rape, and I leave a fat taste 
 Get off the microphone kid, stay in a child's place 
 I cook you up, like Uptown raw base 
 And leave you open like if you just saw Scarface 
 Like I said it before, shorty scores, I get raw 
 For the cause, battle me, take a loss 
 I steal shows like BelBivDevoe's 
 And put on my latex when I hit up the hoes 
 You know the flavor kid, give me my props

 Money don't fake moves 'cause I probably hit your sister

 That's why your stupid ass got bucked 
 Outta luck, never took the time to wish 
 Took a bitch down then I'm out like quick

 That was then, this is now, I'm goin' for the gold 
 Thirty yard touchdown, Mr. Short

 We in this together son your beef is mines 
 So long as the sun shines to light up the sky 
 We in this together son your beef is mines 
 Let me start from the beginning, at the top of the list 
 KnowhatI'mean? Have a situation like this 
 Another war story from a thirsty young hustler 
 Won't trust ya, I'd rather bust ya, and leave your corpse 
 For the cops to discover, while I be dippin in the Range Rover 
 All jewelled like Liberace 
 You watch me while Jakes tryin' to knock me and lock me 
 But I'll be on the low sippin Asti Spumante 
 Niggaz try to creep on the side of my jeep 
 Stuck the heat through the window rocked they ass to sleep 
 Over a 3-pack, it was a small thing really yeah 
 But keep lettin them small things slide and be a failure 
 If I'm out of town one of my crew'll take care of ya 
 The world is ours and your team's inferior 
 You wanna bust caps I get, all up in your area 
 Kidnap your children make the situation scarier 
 Life is a gamble, we scramble for money 
 I might crack a smile but ain't a damn thing funny 
 I'm caught up in the dirt where your hands get muddy 
 Plus the outcome turns out to be lovely 
 Got G's in my pocket hit off my main squeeze 
 Push back, the sunroof, let the cold air breeze 
 Through the butter soft leather upholestry 
 But mostly, keep the gat closely, 'cause niggaz wanna toast me 
 Yo I gotta get mines, no matter what the con-sequences 
 Count up my blessings, add up my weapons 
 Cock back the gat and let my nine serve purpose 
 Sling do my thing organize fiend servants 
 Tryin' to make a mil is stress you know the deal 
 So we sling drills get your cap peeled, 'cause everything is real 
 'Cause I wanna chill, laid up in a jacuzzi 
 Sippin bubbly, with my fingers on the uzi 
 Try to infiltrate my fort get caught 
 Dead up in New York, my brain is packed with criminal thoughts 
 Get your life lost never found again my friend 
 Mission completed, watch you drop in less than ten 
 On my road to the riches, hittin snitches off with mad stitches 
 Your last restin place'll be a ditch kid 
 No one can stop me try your style's sloppy 
 Want to be me, you're just an imitation copy 
 My theme is all about making the green 
 Livin' up in luxury, pushin phat whips and livin' comfortably 
 A drug dealer's dream 
 Stash CREAM keys on a triple beam 
 Five hundred SL green, ninety-five nickel gleam 
 Condominium, thug dressed like a gentleman 
 Tailor made ostrich, Chanel for my women friend 
 Murderin, numbers on your head while I'm burglarin 
 Shank is servin' em, whassup to all my niggaz swervin in 
 New York metropolis, the Bridge brings apocalypse 
 Shoot at the clouds feels like, the holy beast is watchin us 
 Mad man my sanity is goin' like an hourglass 
 Gun inside my bad hand I sliced tryin' to bag grams 
 I got hoes that used to milk you 
 Niggaz who could've killed you 
 Is down with my ill crew of psychoes 
 Nas Escobar movin on your weak production 
 Pumpin corruption in the third world we just bustin' 
 Hold up and analyze the wildcats slang cracks 
 They swing an axe, the new routines, be my eyes black's 
 Playin' corners glancin all up in your cornea 
 Corner ya, seen cats snatch monies up on ya 
 But late night, candlelight fiend with a crack right 
 It's only right, feelin' higher than an airplane right 
 Word yo, I want to get this money then blow 
 Take my time, blast a nine, if you front you go 
 Sip beers, the German ones, hand my guns to sons 
 Shaolin, and Queensbridge we robbin niggaz for fun 
 But still, write my will out to my seeds then build 
 Mahalia sing a tale but the real we still kill 
 Uh 
 Lay back 
 Word up, just bless em 
 With the bulletproof

 Facing 3, 3 to 9 is mad time 
 After reconcurrence for assault 2 9

 Can lead to a mothefucka suicide thing

 I'm going all out you know moves I never fake 
 And fuck the jake digger catch me at my way

 Put the light in the air sometimes I just don't care

 What up Kiko? I ain't seen your ass since we was kids 
 It's all strange my nigga's locked down thinking long range 
 And see their names in the Daily news third page

 They looked at me and said ""Queen's niggas don't play. Do your thing 
 I'll do mine kid stay outta my way""

 Can't stop till I'm eatin' off a platinum plate

 Lock me up for ever but they can't deflate me 'cause 
 Havin' cash is highly addictive 
 Especially when you're used to havin' money to live with

 Ain't no love it seems the devil done stole my soul

 Yo Big Noyd! (What up cuzin'?) I can't cope 
 With all these crab niggas tryna shorten my rope 
 Yo it's the r - a double p 
 E - r, n - o - y - d 
 Niggas can't fuck with me 
 Comin' straight outta QB 
 Pushin' an Infiniti 
 You ask can I rip it constantly? Mentally? 
 Definitely, to the death of me 
 Come and test me 
 Trust me, nigga couldn't touch me if he snuff me 
 So bust me, you're gonna have to, 'cause I'ma blast you 
 My lyrical like a miracle, ill spiritual 
 I'm born wit' it 
 I'm gettin' on wit' it 
 An' I'ma have it till I'm fuckin' dead and gone wit' it 
 'Cause I'm a what? Composer of hardcore 
 A lyrical destructor 
 Don't make me buck ya, 'cause I'm a wild muthafucka 
 You know my flow, you know my stilo 
 Even pack my gat when I go to see my PO 
 Jump out my hooptie 
 Pass my gat and my lucci to my shorty 
 In case my PO try to troop me to the island 
 And if I start wildin' 
 Flippin' on niggas walkin' around wit' da nice gold medallions 
 But she didn't violate me, so I escaped see 
 Back to Queen's pumpin' the fiends makin' more Cream 
 Know what I mean? I'm a natural born hustler 
 Won't try to cut ya, pull out my 4 4 and bust ya 
 Yo babe no time for fakin' jacks 
 'Cause niggas who fake jacks get laid on their backs 
 The streets is real can't roll without steel 
 I feel how I feel 'cause I was born to kill 
 Do what I gotta, to eat a decent meal 
 Brothers is starvin', don't try to find a job son 
 It's all about robbin' 
 So don't be alarmed 
 When we come through, 'cause we supposed to 
 If you opposed to 
 Get your face blown dude, off the map 
 'Cause I react, attack 
 A brother wasn't blessed with wealth so I act like that 
 Drug dealin' 
 I'm frontin on the world once I start 4-wheelin' 
 Cause back on the 41st side we do a ride 
 Sippin E & J, gettin' bent all night 
 Yo, who dat? I never seen him in my whole life 
 Step to his business 'cause it's only right 
 Po po ain't around so I grab my pound 
 Money retaliated so I hit the ground 
 My life is on the line gotta hold my projects down 
 Can't see myself gettin' bodied by a clown-ass nigga 
 That ain't even from my town 
 Hit him up in the chest and now he's layin' me down dead 
 And up from under the benches I started hearin' sirens 
 I stop firin' 
 He cut ass like a diamond 
 Jetted to the cribpiece, what a relief 
 Stashed the heat then proceeded to peep out the window 
 Call my son, ""yo son we got beef 
 But no question 
 Money had a problem so I solved him"" 
 I got my mind on the stick-up now it's time to get paid 
 Thinkin' of ways to take loot already made 
 There's crime in the air, ain't no time to be afraid 
 Gimme yours and get laid 
 Give up the goods and get sprayed 
 I got lots of love, for my crew that is 
 No love for them other crews and rival kids 
 All them out-a-town niggas know what time it is 
 And if they don't they need to buy a watch 
 Word up 
 Caught up in the cross-fire get theyself hurt 
 While I be sippin' gin straight in a plastic cup 
 On a park bench on 12th st., my whole crew's famous 
 You tried to bust your gat and keep it real but you nameless 
 First of all slow down, you on the wrong route 
 Let me put you on your feet and show you what's it all about 
 The street life ain't nuttin' to play with 
 No jokes no games kid 
 For years I been doin' the same shit 
 Just drinkin' liquor, doin' bids 
 Extortin' crack heads 
 And stickin' up the stick-up kids"
19,Mobb Deep,hiphop,Temperature's Rising,"Yeah 
 Uh, no doubt, son, word up 
 (Havoc) 
 Word up, son, I heard they got you on the run 
 Filled with body, now it's time to stash the guns 
 They probably got the phone tap so I won't speak long 
 Gimme a half second and I'ma put you on 
 It's all messed up, somebody's snitchin on the crew 
 And word is on the street is they got pictures of you 
 Homicide came to the crib last night, six deep 
 Axin on your whereabouts, so where d'you sleep? 
 They said they just wanna question you bet me and you know 
 That once they catch you, all they do is just arrest you 
 Then arraign you, hang you, I don't think so 
 It's a good thing you bounced but now you're stayin low 
 Once in a blue I check ta see how ya doin' 
 I know you need loot so I send it through Western Union 
 They probably knock down the door 
 In the middle of the night, sometimes around four 
 Hopin to find who they're lookin' for but they want ta see 
 All they gonna find is mad empty bags of weed 
 But worse, son, you got the projects hotter than hell 
 Harder for brothers to get their thug on but oh well 
 Son, they know too much, even the hoodrat chicks 
 Oh, you heard who did what and why I don't this shit 
 So stop askin, then I know I'm not goin' crazy 
 From windows I see lights flashin and maybe 
 Somebody's takin' pictures 
 You know who that be, police lovers and neighbourhood snitches 
 They put up *?pertice?* so everybody's pointin fingers 
 And lyin', aiyo son, the temp is risin' 
 The temperature's risin', no there's nothin' surprisin 
 The temperature's risin', huh and nothin's surprisin 
 The temperature's risin', huh and there's nothin' surprisin 
 The temperature's risin' (There's nothin' surprisin) 
 (Prodigy) 
 What up, black? Hold your head wherever you at 
 On the flow from the cops or wings on your backs 
 That snitch nigga gave police your location 
 We'll chop his body up in six degrees of separation 
 Killer listen, shit ain't the same without you at home 
 Phony niggas walk around tryin' to be your clone 
 They really fear you, when you was at home you was pale 
 That's why they wanna see you either dead or in jail 
 By the time you hear this rhyme you probably be locked up 
 Tried to hussle, where along the lines your plan slipped up 
 Got caught up in a crime that you can't take back 
 Reminisce on how I use to pick you up in the Ac 
 Years ago when we was younger seemed the hood took us under very deep 
 Wonderin who snitched and got me losin lots of sleep 
 At night, you know my mouth is tight 
 I never sang to the cops 'cause that shit ain't right 
 Sometimes I stroll past the scene of the crime and backtrack 
 Damn, why the situation go down like dat? 
 It'll be a long time before the heat dies down 
 In a couple of years, fool we'll see you around 
 But till then maintain and keep ya story the same 
 The cops is grabbin wrong niggas, lookin' for someone to blame 
 They harrassin, strugglin to find the truth 
 Is it a chance ya case'll get thrown out 'cause they ain't got no proof 
 To say you're guilty, your fingerprints filthy 
 Deliver me the gun, I'll tie two, quickly throw it in the river 
 Make sure it's safe to the bottom 
 Our smart police snuck you out at the projects, we got em 
 But still, but still, but still... 
 (Surprisin) 
 *Repeat to fade*"
20,Mobb Deep,hiphop,Up North Trip,"Verse One: Prodigy 
 It all began on the street, to the back of a blue police vehicle 
 Next come the bookends, the way things is looking 
 It's Friday, you in for a long stay, gettin' shackled on the bus 
 First thing come Monday, hoping in your mind you'll be released one day 
 But knowing, home is a place you're not going for a long while 
 Now you're up on the isle, in a position that you ain't got to, refusing 
 To smile 
 But keep in mind there's a brighter day, after your time spent 
 Used to be wild, but locked up, you can't get bent 
 Thought you could hack it, now you're requesting Pee, see you fragile 
 It ain't hard to see, niggas like that don't associate with me 
 I'd rather, get busy to the third degree 
 Cause the war populations are 
 If this was the street, my razor would be a mack demon 
 Hit you up, leave your whole face screaming, what you in for kid 
 Busting nuts, taps heard of million street stories caught inside this trap 
 Who are you to look at me with your eyes like that 
 Wising up young blood, before you make things escalate, and I would hate 
 To set your crooked ass straight 
 Make your moves at night, pack your heat in this warzone, niggas is trife 
 Runnin' from one time, ain't no time to slip, make one false move 
 And it's a up north trip 
 Livin' the high life, make your moves at night, pack your heat in this warzone 
 Niggas is trife, runnin' from one time, ain't no time to slip, make one 
 False move And it's a up north trip 
 Verse Two: Havoc 
 You tried to dip, duck, but still got bucked, you talk too much shit 
 You should have kept your mouth shut, all that gossip 
 Motherfucker don't you know my glock kicks, hollow tips 
 To your body, mad toxic, I fade you, blow you with a rusty-ass razor 
 Did you a favor, tried to wet you but I grazed you 
 Pop goes the glock when there's beef on the block, chill for a while 
 Make them think the beef stop, then I creep like a thief in the night 
 It's only right, ain't no turnin' back, it's on tonight, and if I get caught 
 Then my ass is up north, straight on the course for upstate New York 
 Stress, smokin' back to back cigaretttes, it popped off, gon' point in 
 The mess hall 
 But to avoid that, from head to toe, dipped in all black, hit them niggas 
 Where they pump they cracks at, Havoc, with the murder masterplan 
 Keep my nine up to par, so my shit won't jam, God forbid if my shit do 
 Run behind a tree, fix my shit then hit you, slugs in your body 
 Mainly in your brain tissue, witness from the scene, get ghost, stash 
 The pistol 
 So simple then, watch my back, lay up and relax, roll a sack, ?K-A black? 
 Find a shorty intact 
 Verse Three: Prodigy 
 I got the powder, combine wit the powder, and water, it oughtta 
 Drop in a half and hour, in the, form of oil, watch the cocaine boil 
 Keep my eye on it so the shit won't spoil, then I pause 
 And ask God why, did he put me on the serve, just so I could die 
 I sit back and build on, all the things I did wrong, why I'm still breathing 
 And all my friends gone, I try not to dwell on the subject for a while 
 'Cause I might get stuck in this corrupt lifestyle, but my 
 Heart pumps foul blood through my arteries, and I can't turn it back 
 It's a part of me, too late for cryin, I'm a grown man struggling 
 To reach the next level of life, without fumbling, down to folding 
 I got no shoulder to lean on but my own, all alone in this danger zone 
 Time waits for no man, the streets grow worse, fuck the whole world kid 
 My money comes first, 'cause I'm out for the gusto, and trust nobody 
 If you're not family, then you die by me, cause niggas will have you 
 Locked up 
 The snitch, be a man, givin' police the run down on your plans 
 We're never goin' down like that, so I, shut my mouth and hold my words back 
 The legal business, forever mine, fuck payin' taxes, the last kid that shitted 
 And gave police access, to my blueprints, used names as evidence 
 Skipped town and I haven't seen the snitch nigga ever since 
 The moral of the story is easy to figure out, a lesson that you can't 
 Live without 
 Repeat Chorus once 
 *Livin' the high life"
21,Mobb Deep,hiphop,Trife Life,"Check it out now... 
 Word up Son, shit is ill kid... 
 Knahmsayin? Bein that we livin' the motherfuckin trife life 
 Don't have another day right? 
 It's only right 
 Let me put you on to what happens Son, never believe this shit 
 Kick that shit 
 (Prodigy) 
 It's just another day, drownin my troubles with a forty 
 That's when I got the call from this brownskin shorty 
 She asked me where's my crew at? Said we could do whatever 
 She got her crew too, and said that we should get together 
 I said, ""Aight -- just call me back in a hour 
 So I can take a shower and gather up the manpower"" 
 Then I hung up the horn 
 And I thought to myself that it might be on 
 Cause this trick ain't pick up the phone to call me in years (Why?) 
 Ever since I left the hoe lonely in tears 
 Ain't no tellin' what her friends puttin' up in her ears 
 Ideas of settin me up, I'm not tryin' ta hear 
 (Check it out, Son) So we take the gats for precautions 
 Plus this trick live in Brooklyn, home of the coffin 
 She might got a whole batallion of Bucktowners 
 Waitin for us to get up off the train and surround us 
 Or maybe, I'm blowin' this shit out of proportion 
 But this shit do happen, to niggaz very often 
 So fuck it, a nigga gotta do what he meant to 
 My crew got my back, fuck the world is my mental 
 We put together five soldiers, the bitch called 
 My blood curdled, told me to meet her on Myrtle 
 Got to the plaza, we're waitin for the G train 
 We put a plan together, just in case the beef came 
 Now we Bed Stuy bound 
 Far from home and on unknown ground 
 But together we six deep, with fire piece, nuttin sweet 
 First nigga frontin gettin' lifted off his fuckin' feet 
 It took eternity, we reached our destination 
 My heartbeat is racin like a cardiac patient 
 We finally got to Myrtle outside the train station 
 I saw not a soul, told my peoples to be patient 
 But hold up, that's when a black caravan rolled up 
 My legs then froze up, I grabbed my pound 
 Told my man, ""Eyes open cause it might go down"" 
 Said he don't like the way the shit is startin to sound 
 Evey angle of the car was smoked out and tinted 
 So we couldn't tell if the enemy was in it 
 It mighta been TNT, I wasn't tryin' to wait and see, we 
 Jetted through Marcy cause Dee's ain't baggin me 
 Word Son, they got us on the run, Dunn, see yo 
 Check it out, check it out, check it out, yo 
 Trife life got me thinkin' like an animal 
 No doubt, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt yo 
 What can kill you is what you don't know 
 (Havoc) 
 OK check it, you're on your way to your girl's crib 
 But the bitch live in the 'Bridge 
 You ain't really sweatin it, cause little do you know 
 The niggaz in the 'Bridge be settin it 
 You thought you was safe and tried to walk the backstreets without heat 
 On the 41st Side (settin it) of 12th Street 
 The cyber-niggaz don't give a fuck 
 Decide well if you come through frontin, kid you gettin' bucked 
 On your way, to apartment 3A 
 With a phat herringbone, let him slide, no days 
 Son get the heat, 'cause I'm about to stick em 
 (Fuck that shit, yo if that nigga front, yo hit him!) 
 Aight bet, so just hold it down 
 While I cock back the long three pound 
 You're upstairs bonin, not knowin' that I'm scheamin 
 Just the right time kid, it's twelve in the evenin 
 You're leavin' out the buildin as you kiss your girl goodbye 
 Thought you was safe and got caught by surprised 
 ""What's goin' on?"", as I reply 
 ""Shut the fuck up and don't make this 'to another homicide"" 
 He tried to play tough so I put one in his brain 
 Even though I took his life, all I wanted was the chain 
 Come through truck without heat, how you figure? 
 When you in the projects keep your fingers on the trigger 
 But fuck that we're juxin, if you got what we like you gets tooken 
 Put you on your back, send you on your way, yo good lookin' 
 Now be catchin the cap that holes in ya Lewis in Brooklyn 
 Gettin' to' up from the flo' up, hit the dress sto' up 
 Got the 80-0 in case a nigga wanna roll up 
 Get'cha motherfuckin shit swoll up 
 Now it's back to Queens to serve fiends 
 Makin' G's by any means, my eyes on my enemies 
 Sippin Hennessey, with my mind on some crime shit 
 One-time searchin me but never ever find shit 
 It's the everyday, get the loot then breeze 
 Though my goal is to leave outta state, push ki's 
 But all this bullshit holdin' me down, I can't leave 
 Fuck a 9-to-5, I get the loot with ease 
 Don't even need a degree to earn a six-digit figure 
 I get mines slingin on the corner with my niggaz 
 Pullin the trigger when the drama appears 
 Cause that nigga worse enemy is FEAR 
 So yo... 
 No doubt, so what can kill you is what you don't know...

 *More chaos* 
 (Prodigy) 
 I open my eyes to the streets where I was raised as a man 
 And learned to use my hands for protection 
 In scuffles, throw all my blows in doubles 
 I'm coming from Queens motherfucker carrying guns in couples 
 And wilding, a Q-U soldier 
 From Lefrak to Rockaway back to Queensbridge 
 Black it's only crack sales makin' niggaz act like that 
 Back in the days we could scrap, now you lay on your back 
 As things changed with time I traded in my knuckles for a Mac-10 
 And rather live the life of crime 
 With my Bed-Stuy connection connected in two 
 It's live Boo start shit too wild for you 
 Peace to, Baesley, Forty-P get down 
 And when you outta town represent your ground 
 Them niggaz bleed just like us so show 'em where we come from 
 Queens; leavin' niggaz done Son 
 The Mobb gets hectic 
 Shit is for real up in Queens we get hectic 
 Shit is for real we abouts to get hectic (3X) 
 (Havoc) 
 As we sling on the corners like we always do 
 Son get that loot quick, spending dough like I never had shit 
 I'm living large pushin luxury cars 
 Though that shit is outta reach, anybody in my wake gets scarred 
 Permanently bed-ridden 
 And if you're pussy, then motherfucker get in where you fit in 
 As I walk around the streets 
 Son I got mad beef, I'ma blast you before you blast me 
 That's my philosophy cause nowadays you gotta be relentless 
 Grab my Mac and slap a nigga senseless 
 Don't try to play me if you do you better D.O.A. me 
 Son I got 'em shook grab a little baby for shields 
 You got drama run for shelter for real 
 Pour some beer for the ill ain't no time to chill 
 Hit 'em up 'cause I'm quick to erupt like this 
 Wet 'em up with the Mac scratch 'em off my list 
 Show em, the real meaning of drama you never had it 
 Till you bumped heads with the Havoc 
 Ain't nuttin soft or sweat, I lift you off your feet 
 When I cock back the heat, whole crews retreat

 Ain't nothing soft or sweet, I lift you off your feet 
 When I cock back the heat whole crews retreat 
 We gets hectic 
 Shit is for real we abouts to get hectic (2X) 
 (Prodigy) 
 Everything is real inside my mind; these days 
 You can't make it if you ain't affiliated with crime 
 A lifetime of street living 
 Throughout the beef I've accumulated many slugs have been given 
 But wilding ain't the way to be living 
 You're only gonna end up bloody on a floor shivering 
 Or locked up, caught inside the beast 
 Meanwhile on the street saying no more peace 
 My man, Sto-Bo, kid hold your own 
 In a cell locked down not far from home 
 And at the same time on the outside I'm representing 
 Still packin heat make you cowards keep stepping 
 Getting high, it's cause of the lye, I can't lie 
 I could move the crowd poppin' slugs in the sky 
 Why come around if you afraid of what's over here 
 My man Havoc put the bug in my ear 
 On the real, for real, but wait it gets realer 
 Real like an innocent child that turn killer 
 It's thing like that that only makes things iller 
 And makin' cream doin' sticks if you ain't a drug dealer 
 (It's) only facts coming out of my mouth feeds 
 As far as I can see these streets is getting sour 
 Q, U, too much drama to get into 
 And niggaz regret when they begin to 
 Regardless of your name or what you been through 
 Pause for a second, open your eyes and think dude 
 Life ain't the game that it seems to be 
 Fuck a fantasy I'm leaving in reality 
 Caught up in this untouchable mentality 
 Hit you up bad, make you loose a few calories 
 I need to slow down, movin through life at a high speed 
 Watchin all the slow runners pass by me 
 I can see through you, due to, my Queens education 
 Speaking in behalf of this drug-game nation 
 The Foundation, the Queens nation

 Ways of action, I grab the gat and 
 Ain't no turning back when I start blasting 
 Pick up the handle and insert the potion 
 Cock the shit back in a calm like motion

 You got a real ice grill but are you really real 
 Step to the hill and I'm a test your gun skills 
 'Cause real niggaz don't try to profile 
 You just a chump who needs to get drunk to buckwhyle 
 But swing that bullshit this way 
 And I'm a make your visit to the bridge a muthafuking short stay 
 Queensbridge, that's where I'm from 
 The place where stars are born and phony rappers get done 
 6 blocks and you might not make it through 
 What you gonna do when my whole crew is blazing at you 
 Wit macs and tecs to lend to get your dome crush 
 You thought that you could come around my way, you big stupid fuk 
 What the hell you smoking, what the fuk possessed you

 Twist a nigga cap, then jump in the J-30

 Rocking Convertibles, frop tops and mad high 
 Peace to that whiz kid and playas on his team

 Whip after whip, stay flashing your dick on tricks 
 Your whole crew's ravishing, team's untouchable 
 In the jungle, banging Nas, Mobb Deep and Wu 
 There's money out there, guns catch crumbs, those are your sons 
 Jums is in the mailboxes, bitches holding your guns 
 You know what's out there, thousands of gram, wrapped in siran 
 Sealed tight, keep the freshness, that's how we expand 
 Masked Avenger, drop your gun, son, now surrender 
 Get ninjaed on the island, plus the Bridge, boy remember

 My little thug's selling drugs and he's struggling 
 The game got him bugging, I tried to tell him slow down cousin 
 But he vexed and niggaz getting wet up in the projects 
 But wit no doubt, shorties out for his respect 
 But is his brain insane from the lye 
 From smoking that 118 ?chiny tye? 
 Why, a nigga just died last week 
 As he swore he was growing, he's a thug in the street 
 But it's like that, my crew pump cracks and we pack mac 
 His eyes is wild wit the rezzy monkey on his back 
 But I'm stressed and he need to be blessed 
 Wit a firepack, don't even go there 'cause it ain't like that 
 Slow down baby, he said, what, you trying to play me 
 You must be crazy, pulled out the heat and almost blazed me 
 Then he was Swayze, the shot must of dazed me 
 Thug's selling drug, busting slugs, but he ain't crazy"

 Life is like a dice game and I'm into win 
 On the scene from the 41st side of Queens 
 We get the cream laid up love love for dame

 Doin' my thing, do wild stakes my namell reign

 Saw my man layin' dead on the floor, kid I swore 
 That our crew will live forever, I guess I was wrong 
 No, until we meet again, hold ya head and stay strong (yeah) 
 Yo, got my mind on a place to hide from police (where) 
 Sweatin' dogs as I'm runnin' cross 12th Street 
 Just as I approach the block 
 I spot a jake on the creep down by Vicks weed spot (so what) 
 Made a you-ey up the hill plus a change of plans 
 I had to hurry back so I could warn my man 
 Ya had me stressin' little son, had my heart rapidly pumpin' 
 Niggas start a guttin' behind the bushes duckin' 
 My ears rung, I punch a clip into the guns 
 Got in the arm, one slug hit my son 
 He was bleedin' from the head I couldn't believe it 
 We was defeated if it was a case I couldn't beat it 
 Felt like cryin' (the temperatures risin')

 On a door to be open, goin' in the building, it's a trap 
 Police buckin' at me, they try to twist my tongue back 
 Jetted up the staircase to the third floor 
 Reached behind the sink, throw the heater on the floor 
 Locked the door, police grabbed me up and tried to break my jaw 
 So where's the gun we saw? (I don't know) 
 We know you was there at the homicide scene (I know nuttin') 
 And if it wasn't you, was somebody from ya team 
 (Chrous) 
 From the cradle to the grave 
 (From the cradle to the grave) 
 (Repeat: x2) 
 Straight from the motherfuckin' cradle to the grave 
 Yo, it's the real drama kills, nobody moves, stand still 
 Bottle you drop that ass off in a land fill 
 Son bless me with the iron, I got beef 
 With some niggas from the other side over some weak shit 
 Load up the heaters, greet 'em with the hollow tips 
 Flip 'em like the Gotti clip my crew shift the body shift 
 The cradle to the grave is where I'll end up 
 Fuck gettin' sent up north, son I'm better 
 Doin' my dirt on a low 
 Fuckin' wit them mobbers like a crowd 
 No doubt you gonna blow you never know 
 He didn't even have to go there 
 Unprepared now he's six below 
 Why know I'm chillin', I gots no time for catchin' feelings 
 Get that money I wants, some brothers want to act funny 
 But it's all good I still die for the hood 
 For my peoples, yeah knock on wood 
 Triple L, rollin' dice while I put you on 
 To the drama what I gotta say is short not long 
 This nigga that I'm beginning to dislike he got me fed 
 If he doesn't discontinue his bullshit he might be dead 
 Know him well and probably go way back 
 But I don't care if he's your man doin' shit like that 
 I hope the word gets back to him, 'cause I screw him 
 He shitted on my man and we got plans to do him 
 Let's get it over with quick, I'm tired of waitin' 
 Ain't no fair overhead there we just debatin' on when and how 
 Later on right now, spoke to Killa yesterday 
 He said to chill for a while 
 But it's hard acting like everything is all right 
 I get the chills when I see that nigga in my sight 
 A dead man walking not only that he's still talkin'(about what) 
 About how what he did buried off and you don't know 
 How much I fiend to put his ass in a coffin 
 One day my man and the next he's not 
 Didn't know him long anyway so fuck it 
 It's funny how things change (word up) 
 Word up man 
 Why know what I'm sayin' we gonna die 
 It's for real, kid no games bein' played"

 Forever wild from the cradle to the grave 
 Kid, watch your back, one time, it's comin' always (Yeah!) 
 They lock me up for 12 days, I can't comprehend 
 Now I'm a free man on the streets again 
 Chasin St.Ide's down with some Seagrams Gin 
 Life is like a dice game and I'm into win 
 (Havoc) 
 On the scene from the 41st side of Queens 
 We get the CREAM, laid up, love-love for dame 
 'Cause I mean what I mean, I'm out to claim King 
 Doin' my thing, do wild stakes my name'll reign

 To all my peoples locked down comin' back to life 
 In the world once again though ya fear was trife 
 While you was gone, we was goin' to war and even more 
 Saw my man layin dead on the floor, kid I swore 
 That our crew will live forever, I guess I was wrong 
 No, until we meet again, hold ya head and stay strong (Yeah!) 
 Yo, got my mind on a place to hide from police (Where?) 
 Sweatin dogs as I'm runnin' cross 12th Street 
 Just as I approach the block 
 I spot a jake on the creep down by Vick's weed spot (So what!) 
 Made a U-ey up the hill plus a change of plans 
 I had to hurry back so I could warn my man 
 (Havoc) 
 Ya had me stressin little sumthin, had my heart rapidly pumpin 
 Niggas start a guttin behind the bushes duckin 
 My ears rung, I punch a clip into the guns 
 Got (?Raydes?) in the arm, one slug hit my son 
 He was bleedin from the head, I couldn't believe it 
 We was defeated, if it was a case I couldn't beat it 
 Felt like cryin (The temperature's risin') 
 I saw my man helpless, damn near on the verge of dyin' 
 So to P I passed the iron

26,Mobb Deep,hiphop,Drink Away The Pain (Situations),"Yeah, about to get my thug on 
 The 41st side of things 
 Verse One: Prodigy 
 I used to be in love with this bitch named E&J 
 Don't fuck with her anymore now I fuck with Tanqueray 
 Tanqueray introduced me to her first cousin Gold 
 Last name was Ide's and the first name Old 
 But Gold couldn't take the dick and made me lazy 
 We split apart and now I met this new trick Dany 
 Now me and Dany, we been together ever since 
 Our love combines to form a science, what is this 
 I bust a cherry, took her virginity in ninety-one 
 Now that she's open everybody want to tap somethin' 
 Go get your own don't make me have to fuckin' clap somethin' 
 I love my shorty more than life now ain't that somethin' 
 So love you Dany more than livin' itself 
 Even though my friends tell me she ain't good for my health 
 When I go pick her up they tell me put her back on the shelf 
 They say say yo P she only wants you for one thing that's your wealth 
 But I don't pay attention, she's my baby, the Dany 
 You know she drive me crazy she's my number one lady 
 Met her back in eighty-nine now she's twenty-two 
 Actin' like she forty, she said all I need is a man to support me 
 Besides, you from the 41st side of things 
 And Queensbridge niggaz be actin' like they kings 
 Pushin Lexus' wearin fat diamond rings 
 My cellular phone reigns supreme, international think rational 
 The 12th street crew move back when we come through 
 I think the whole world's goin' insane 
 I fill my brain up with Dany, and drink away the pain 
 I think the whole world's goin' insane 
 I fill my mind up with liquor, and drink away the pain 
 I think the whole world's losin it's brain 
 I fill my brain up with liquor, and drink away the pain 
 I think the whole world's goin' insane 
 I fill my brain up with Dany, and drink away the pain 
 Verse Two: Q-Tip 
 Tommy Hil was my nigga, and other's couldn't figure 
 How me and Hilfiger used to move through with vigor 
 Had to sit and plan on how to make these seven figures 
 Said the Brinks is comin' through, at Fashion Avenue 
 At Tuesday at two, now we gotta form a crew 
 Now we gotta forum a crew, of motherfuckers 
 Who ain't goin' out like suckers 
 Told me call Karl Kani, and all my other brothers 
 I told my sister Walker, who was the smoothest talker 
 Negotiate the deal with them other money stalkers 
 Diesel drove the the beemer, the hatchback of course 
 Nautica'll navigate to keep us on course 
 Polo's acting bolo trying to say he the Boss 
 I said shut the fuck up, the kid is out where the loot's at 
 Got a big trey pound, picture just to swoop back 
 Timb is on the roof with the twelve gauge rifle 
 Scope is on the top so you know he livin' Eiffel 
 Took the aim of Oswald, caught him North in the face 
 All them other kids they had they tools aimed at space 
 Levi had the snub so you know they gettin' laced 
 Donna Karan was cryin, cause mad shells was flyin 
 Damn all we want is a piece of the pie and 
 Nike scooped the sess 'cause he moves like Air 
 Threw them shits up in the trunk now we up out here 
 Got back to the mansion, to divvy up the paper 
 Helle Hansen was the brain of the whole entire caper 
 So she felt it was right, for her to get the whole slice 
 Everybody in the crew didn't think it was nice 
 I guess not, and guess what's hot, so guess what 
 Guess took the jigga, and jigged her in the gut 
 When you play with crime sometime's it's not too fly 
 Even though the goods look deceivin to the eye 
 The end situation could leave your ass dry 
 That's why you got to walk on by, walk on by 
 Walk on by, walk on by, walk on by... 
 Verse Three: Havoc 
 My man P put me on to the shorty Henn Rock 
 Now Henn Rock is strong enough to make your heartbeat stop 
 One sip I thought the bitch was a fuckin' warlock 
 The more she started givin' me the stronger I got 
 Pushed her off to the crew then she started gettin' jealous 
 Steamed 'cause I spent more CREAM with the fellaz 
 Fuck them niggaz spend that cheese on me 
 See if they be around when you need pussy 
 Then I thought to myself yo this drink is right 
 Gathered up all my dough, so I spent the night 
 I can't help it, she got my brain in a headlock 
 Niggaz started riffin why you trickin yo diz shit must stop 
 Moms like you need to see the AA 
 Better hope they help your ass out on the same day 
 But enough of that, I got the shake so I need dat 
 Son caught me stressed out I just be that 
 But when it comes to Hemp Rock dunn I need that 
 She's my shorty for life so fuck the weed bag 
 I think the whole world's goin' insane 
 I fill my brain with the Henny, and drink away the pain 
 I think the whole world's lost it's brain 
 I sip away on the liquor, and drink away the pain 
 For the brothers who ain't here 
 Pour a little on the floor son 
 Time to get a little bent do our thing 
 Word up, the 41st side of Queens 
 We gettin' bent, knowhatI'mean? 
 It's an everyday thing 
 Henny got my mind in a headlock 
 Dany got me goin' crazy 
 Dany take me away 
 Dany take me away 
 Dany take me away 
 Word up 
 Dany take me away"
27,Mobb Deep,hiphop,Shook Ones Pt. II,"Word up son, word 
 Yeah, to all the killas and a hundred dollar billas 
 (Yo I got the phone thing, knowmsayin', keep your eyes open) 
 For real niggas who ain't got no feelings 
 (Keep your eyes open) 
 (No doubt, no doubt son, I got this, I got this) 
 (Just watch my back, I got this first, yo) 
 Check it out now 
 (Word up, say it to them niggas, check this out it's a murda) 
 (Prodigy) 
 I got you stuck off the realness 
 We be the Infamous - you heard of us 
 Official Queensbridge murderers 
 The Mobb comes equipped with warfare, beware 
 Of my crime family who got 'nuff shots to share 
 For all of those who wanna profile and pose 
 Rock you in your face, stab your brain wit' your nosebone 
 You all alone in these streets, cousin 
 Every man for theyself in this land we be gunnin' 
 And keep them shook crews runnin' like they supposed to 
 They come around but they never come close to 
 I can see it inside ya face you're in the wrong place 
 Cowards like you just get they're whole body laced up 
 With bullet holes and such 
 Speak the wrong words man and you will get touched 
 You can put your whole army against my team and 
 I guarantee you it'll be your very last time breathin' 
 Your simple words just don't move me you're minor, we're major 
 You all up in the game and don't deserve to be a player 
 Don't make me have to call your name out; your crew is featherweight 
 My gunshots'll make you levitate 
 I'm only nineteen, but my mind is old 
 And when the things get for real my warm heart turns cold 
 Another nigga deceased, another story gets told 
 It ain't nothin' really hey, yo dun spark the Phillie 
 So I can get my mind off these yellowbacked niggas 
 Why they still alive I don't know, go figure 
 Meanwhile back in Queens the realness is foundation 
 If I die I couldn't choose a better location 
 When the slugs penetrate you feel a burning sensation 
 Getting closer to God in a tight situation (Now) 
 Now, take these words home and think it through 
 Or the next rhyme I write might be about you 
 Son, they shook... 
 'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks 
 Scared to death, scared to look 
 They shook 
 'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks 
 Scared to death, scared to look 
 Livin' the live that of diamonds and guns 
 There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds... earn funds 
 Some of 'em get shot, locked down and turn nuns 
 Cowardly hearts end straight up shook ones... shook ones 
 He ain't a crook son, he's just a shook one... shook one 
 (Havoc) 
 For every rhyme I write, it's 25 to life 
 Yo, it's a must the gats we trust safeguardin' my life 
 Ain't no time for hesitation that only leads to incarceration 
 You don't know me, there's no relation 
 Queensbridge niggas don't play I don't got time 
 For your petty thinking mind son, I'm bigga than those 
 Claimin' that you pack heat but you're scared to hold 
 And when the smoke clears you'll be left with one in your dome 
 13 years in the projects, my mentality is what, kid 
 You talk a good one but you don't want it 
 Sometimes I wonder do I deserve to live 
 Or am I going to burn in hell for all the things I did? 
 No time to dwell on that 'cause my brain reacts 
 Front if you want kid, lay on your back 
 I don't fake that kid you know I bring it to you live 
 Stay in a child's place, kid you out o' line 
 Criminal minds thirsty for recognition 
 I'm sippin'; E&J got my mind flippin' 
 I'm buggin'; think I'm how bizarre to hold my hustlin' 
 Get that loot kid, you know my function 
 'Cause long as I'm alive I'ma live illegal 
 And once I get on I'ma put on, on my people 
 React mix to lyrics like macks I hit your dome up 
 When I roll up, don't be caught sleepin' 'cause I'm creepin' 
 Son, they shook... 
 'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks 
 Scared to death and scared to look 
 (He's just a shook one) 
 They shook... 
 'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks 
 Scared to death and scared to look 
 (We live the live that of diamonds) 
 They shook... 
 'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks 
 Scared to death and scared to look 
 They shook... 
 'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks, crooks... 
 Livin' the live that of diamonds and guns 
 There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds... earn funds 
 But some of 'em get shot, locked down and turn nuns 
 Cowardly hearts end straight up shook ones... shook ones 
 He ain't a crook son, he's just a shook one... shook one 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 To all the villains and a hundred dollar billas 
 To real brothers who ain't got no dealings 
 G-yeah, the whole Bridge, Queens get the money 
 41st side (he's just a shook one) 
 Keepin' it real (you know) 
 Queens get the money...

 Whatever? Party's over tell the rest of the crew 
 Yo P, it's on you, what you wanna do? 
 *Repeat x3* 
 Verse 1: Prodigy, Havoc 
 Every day of my life since 11-2-74 
 On the street makin' non-stop CREAM galore 
 Packin heat, stickin up weed stores and more 
 Collectin interest off of extortions to settle my score 
 It gets deeper when things get real 
 I'm down to stickin out West Bank for my mill 
 And I'm from Hampstead, it's close to the shacks of Park South 
 Well I'll be outside slingin, you're always high 
 And don't come around to the crossroads of life 
 We're to the death, you and me, this beef for eternity 
 I'm goin' out to the fullest extent 
 So far into my troubles it's hard for me to get back 
 To my everyday self and composure 
 Catch you when you open then I bring you to a closure 
 Put ice on a razor and freeze ya when ya shelter 
 I went for ya grill but you dent from my *?rolder?* 
 I know this kid who says he knows ya because of that 
 Now I know where ya lay ya hat at and that's that 
 Say no more, I put it on you while you was yawning 
 Murder without warning the very next morning 
 Once we step through the door, party over, that's the endin 
 You and your crew'll leave out, a bunch of dead men 
 Bump me and I'll bump you back 
 You ain't tough black, niggas like you just get their life jacked 
 But I'ma cool nigga till you push me through the limit 
 But try ta play me and ya ass I get up all in it 
 Don't try to cop please now son, it's dead and done 
 (I gave you fair warning) So run and get your guns 
 It's on, time to show 'em how I perform 
 My attitude'll transform, leave you dead plus wrong 
 Gettin' the flow within, representin for Queens 
 Shit is real, why you hopin that it's all a dream 
 But you can't wake up, wettin a chest you bless 
 Chokin off your own blood, don't blame me you brought your own death 
 Aiyo Noyd, it's on you, what you wanna do? 
 Whatever? Party's over, tell the rest of the crew 
 Yo Big Noyd it's on you, what you wanna do?

 Verse 2: Big Noyd, Prodigy 
 My beeper kept beepin, the other numbers started leakin 
 'Who is this on my mind?' I was thinkin' 
 Then I realised it was my dun playin' 911 
 Once I seen the numbers I ran for the fuckin' guns 
 My dun in trouble, I be there on the double 
 I jumped up in the bubble, yo kid where are you? 
 (1-14 between Manhattan and Morningside Avenue) 
 This happened just right out the blue 
 Aiyo dun, fuck that bitch, tell her get off your dick 
 (But she's cryin and she says she has feelins and shit) 
 Yo it's a settup, them niggas got me fed up 
 Ty stay in the buildin, if they move fuckin' buck em 
 Get up off the scene, you know what I mean? 
 And hide yourself down with them other fuckin' sixteen 
 Glock and get off they block 
 Then I hung up the cellular, ready to rock 
 And it's on 
 Yo, you get deaded in the streets, kid set it 
 You gots no credit, fool you get wetted 
 Up with the semi-auto Mac double, love it 
 'Did he shoot eleven or twelve?' is what he wondered 
 Nigga I got one more shot, you must be drinkin' 
 Put the heater to his head, watch him start blinkin 
 'Am I goin' to heaven or hell?' is what he's thinkin' 
 Switch to a bitch as his life start sinkin 
 Down to a level of no return 
 Pull out the heat 'cause when the slugs hit it definitely burns 
 Now chill and think about your life for real 
 Every member of my crew is livin' life for real 
 Got your self fucked into somethin' that you couldn't finish 
 Up against the fulliest squad and get diminished 
 I'm from Q-U-E another E-N-S 
 So why you small tough talk? I'm not impressed 
 If I seen you in the Bridge, I'd make you undress 
 Give up the money, the polo especially the Guess

 And thirty years for years, start niggas and drink beers 
 Tired of livin' life this way, crime pay

 Plus the fans that you got, wonderin what's got you hot 
 It's too not, knocked out the box and got rocked 
 Got raped on the Island, you officially got 
 Kick that thug shit, Vibe magazine on some love shit 
 (Keep it real kid, you don't know who you fuckin' wit) 
 Chorus: repeat 2X 
 It's the Infamous back in the house once again 
 Livin' the life that of diamonds and guns 
 And now gems pull gats like a basehead pull on stems 
 The Mobb got the bomb run out and tell a friend 
 Drop A Gem On Em 
 Verse Two: Prodigy 
 Yeah likewise, I'm tired of rap guys whose faggots 
 Pure shuteye, and swole up your whole outside 
 I baptize, niggas get wet, put up your backside 
 Your claptized and set straight, put on your head straight 
 Watch out for, 
 These upstate cats be leary of you 
 Yeddy niggas wit gats plus the walls on they backs 
 Rikers Island flashback of the house you got scuffed it in 
 You would think you gettin' your head shot was enough but then 
 Now you wanna got at my team, 
 You must of been drunk when you wrote that shit 
 Too bad you had to did it to your own self 
 My rebellion, I retaliate, I had the whole New York state 
 Aimin at your face 
 At the gate, bottom line of top soon as you came through 
 Shot through, don't even know the half of my crew 
 I got a hundred strong arm niggas ready to rock the shit 
 Clocks tick, your days are numbered in low digits 
 You look suspicious, suspect niggas is bitches 
 Get chppoed up, Grade A meat, somethin' delicious 
 And laced back up, 2 G's, one for stitches 
 Then reconstruct your face and learn how to speak again 
 My Mobb's like a bunch of wild Puerto Ricans 
 Wit bangers the size of African spears 
 It's warfare in the arena, you turn arenas into house of horrors 
 Its terrodome, when you see my click you need to run behind shit 
 You gotta gat you betta find it 
 And use that shit think fast and get reminded 
 Of robberies in Manhattan you knew what happened 
 60 g's and one for gun clappin 
 Who Shot Ya? You'd probably scream louder than an opera 
 New York gotcha, now you wanna use my mob as a crutch 
 What makes you think you can't get bucked again 
 Once again, back in the house once again 
 Live the life that of diamonds and guns 
 And now gems pull gats like a basehead pull on stems 
 The Mobb got the bomb run out and tell a friend 
 It's the Infamous..."

 And run like a faggot switch take the whole shit 
 And show the world don't sweat it baby girl 
 I gotta hem 
 And pull the gat like a stem 
 You all fucked up like a off beat blend 
 I send message that you couldn't read clear 
 Try to play the front but you got stuck in the rear 
 Take it as a letter but I'm not sincere 
 Yo 
 This ain't rap, it's bloodsport 
 Your life cut short, you fell short 
 Pressure's on high, full court 
 My team form killer instincts and fire arms 
 Dangerous stuff mine's brainstorm wars 
 A life of a wild rebel, who run wild 
 Clik (blaow-blaow) nigga lay down (blaow) fool stay down 
 Appear, disappear, a hydro cloud 
 While you running at the mouth a hundred miles, I'm out 
 Mobb Deep style from the depths of Hempstead 
 Get ninja'd 
 I creep quiet, keep the live nigga inchin' 
 Listen, who are you to throw your fist in? 
 Hit like a bitch, run like a faggot an take the whole shit 
 That's it 
 I had to pass here with shit 
 It's time for showtime, let's see how deep things get 
 You want to talk tough and get all delinquent 
 You find yourself all bloodied up and shameded 
 Me and my man pioneered this violent nigga rap shit 
 Bust a gat, give me no fear of that, I'm laughin' 
 What's up there? let's take you there and touch something 
 I'm a maniac, brainiac, fanatic at that 
 Capable of combat, P counterattack 
 In some hot wheels, sendin shots out the back 
 It was a foul way to go, Kicko 
 You know the ropes so... 
 Bloodsport motherfucker 
 Ay yo the rockweiler 
 Chew in chew out ass niggas, pull 'em on your collar 
 And let the lights dimmin 
 And you'll be swimmin in a puddle of reality, juice 
 Fatality too 
 This rap is the bitch, you shouldn't marry the two 
 To the set of prenumtual 
 Got paid in too comfortable 
 It's all good, we don't want to humble 
 And while you shinin in the spotlight 
 I got this dot right 
 The aimed right a stoplight 
 The trife life, ain't no part two's

 Hit you up quick strictly shit that I'm livin' in 
 You walk a line that's thin, you religious well you sin 
 Fuckin' with the Mobb, Infamous to the end 
 I hold a nine Ruger, with an infa-spot disc 
 Red dot right at your face, so set sail or rock it 
 And kept drivin', pull off like the Indy 5 G 
 In a four time Ford truck with Speed 
 Like the motion picture, this nigga Gone With the Wind 
 My crime work, ninja style shit was did 
 And got away with, escaped it, the Jakes from tracing 
 Anything that lead to the source, you know the boss 
 Of the Mobb killing, is like an Unsolved Mystery 
 Puzzling, nobody knows, it's all history 
 Madness amongst me, I frequently have to get lovely 
 Never fails it's always something 
 No rest, daily gotta rock my vest 
 I shoot at your best man yeah your MVP 
 He played the front line got struck down immediately 
 I wave a Mobb Deep flag, you hear the sound as it slaps when 
 Heavy load my military hold ammunition 
 Far from animation, it's real live, you think not 
 My crew, changing New York, who taking your spot 
 I put the green light on, your whole click, Island shit 
 Running through the hoe-house wilding, extorting 
 (Extortion, hit that up, extortion, hit that up) 
 Verse Two: Havoc, Method 
 Extortion is the key I got the key for extortion 
 Spend your fortune, dead your shorty like abortion 
 Take precaution, Infamous laws enforced in 
 You married to the Mobb, kid take it then divorce it 
 'Cause I ain't got no time for them domestic disputes 
 If you scared get a dog don't got a click then recruit 
 You're weak troop, lost the tan in the mist 
 On your name my shit, take it like a man you little bitch 
 I blaze yo britches, P.L.O. extortion, you forcin 
 The hand that rocks the cradle, caution before you enter 
 This Shaolin representer, carry thirty-six deadly shits 
 You fuckin' with, top contenders 
 Official to the bone gristle 
 It don't matter if you bust rhymes or bust pistols 
 Remember me, burn a nigga to a third degree 
 Don't act familiar motherfuckers you ain't heard of me 
 Just peep the stee and the rap how it's supposed to be 
 Tap the pockets bag the goods like a grocery, we food-shoppin' 
 On top of that we hip-hoppin, and don't stoppin' 
 Out-of-state drawers-droppin', the panty-raiders 
 Slide on ya like gators, umped that stank bitch back out 
 And then played her, but that ain't nothin' 
 Crossin this dog walkin', native New York and

 A rainy day laid up thinkin' 
 Sitting gettin' bent 
 Watchin old seventy flicks 
 Minds on the slouch 
 Back on the couch 
 Heard the phone ring 
 It was a shorty from uptown I met back day. 
 Long time no hear from 
 No doubt long time no see 
 I heard you had a seed a baby girl and now she 3. 
 What's up wit that cat 
 You know who your baby pops 
 Slung rocks up top then heard he got knocked 
 He home 
 Fuck dat nigga I'm on my own 
 Matter fact got my own crib 
 Plus I'm all alone 
 Word? 
 The bitch is bad 
 Chill son she got me tempted 
 Reminiscing the fatty 
 Jumped in the ride I rented 
 Rest Tims 
 Mecca dice well presented 
 Sippin E & J straight 
 Was bent when I entered 
 Gave her a hug 
 Stared her straight into her mug 
 She ain't she's a bithch back then and now its bugged 
 Turned the VCR on 
 Friday, my favorite flick 
 Its hard for me to drink Alize I take a sip 
 Got into convo, How you been over the years? 
 Neglected, stressed out, and living in fear 
 Whatchu mean, I thought you left that cat which was true 
 I'm not talkin' about him 
 Another dude 
 Been wit him for a year and had a baby by him -- Word? 
 Matter fact you saw him, downstairs you walked by him 
 Now thinks it's a setup 
 Could it be or maybe not. 
 She said don't sweat it he don't got the top lock 
 Tried to play it cool. But in my head shorties wildin 
 Using me to get the next nigga jealous called up the fellas. 
 Ty Nitty line was busy so I beeped Gotti, Gotti was 
 With Trip and two other grimees, The Twinz 
 Let me begin then explain 
 I'm at this bitch crib and I think she got me framed 
 Stuck without a gat 
 Now prepare for combat, 
 Gave the address, told my son there's more cats be here in a second 
 Big gats no half steppin 
 They flippin on me talkin' bout I never learn my lesson 
 I laughed an additional hit them with the math 
 Hung up the jack, While shorty soaked in the bath. 
 Played the living room. 
 Dozed off for a second. 
 When I woke up shorty was standing ass naked. 
 Make moves stepped to the room. 
 All this bullshit pussy better be good 
 Through off my champion hood 
 Slow motion 
 All arm bent off the potion 
 Shorty went down and had a nigga wide open 
 It was over Laid up in the cut 
 I heard a thump 
 Jumped up threw on my boxers 
 Yo, What the fuck? 
 All of a sudden 
 I saw this black motherfucker with this big ass gat and two other 
 Motherfuckers 
 Black masks, Clutching duct tape no escape 
 Tied me up, smacked me all in my face 
 Shorty wasn't even screamin 
 Looked up saw 'em schemin 
 ""Yeah, yeah, we got this nigga now, we got this"" 
 All bloodied up, shook the fuck up 
 Held for ransom, they yelled, smiled and started dancin 
 Let them know they had me hostage 
 Threw me on the phone said son 
 Don't worry son we got this 
 Regardless of the outcome 
 All this bullshit 
 Take a nigga word 
 Don't never go see a bitch, word"

 Verse 1: Prodigy 
 Here come the vultures, the Mobb-laced potent rap shit 
 Perhaps, kid, make it happen, start the flippin 
 You fuckin' comic, who you kidding? 
 My nigga's laughing, blood bathin, the world's greatest 
 In-famous crime-zanous 
 To interfere would be dangerous 
 Plane descent, stand clear, save your strength 
 You couldn't do the limp if you was coked up 
 By my z'd up, whatever the fuck, who gives a fuck? You get fucked 
 My coalition specialises in collision 
 The clash of the cliques, the duel o' the iron mac, spit 
 And leave ya half-split 
 You'll be missin' much more than a fraction 
 When it's time for action 
 Hit 'em while a man down, make that nigga backspin 
 Trapped up, a ???? madman 
 We blastin you're collapsin, heavily light my gold Mac 10 
 Get imprisoned with dem raps they have you relapsin 
 You get castin the Mobb, deaf and assin 
 We face splashin, dope fake's ice-pick stabbin 
 He slow leakin, he 'ternally bleedin for speakin' 
 Outta place, niggas get placed back indecent 
 Live at the main event may I present 
 Screamin out loud for any squad that's deaf 
 My Infamous Mobb, ya heart throb, hold ya breath 
 It's KO from dead arm rights and hard lefts 
 Another satisfied consumer who got blessed 
 Single out ya army till there's no man left 
 Man down (Man down, down, down, down...)

 Lay the fuck down! 
 Verse 2: Havoc 
 Infamous cartel, visible evidence 
 We scarred well, associated team benevolent 
 Never hesitant, opposition get settled here with 
 Sharp shit that'll rip through 
 One hundred layers of Kevlar, sharp like the jim star 
 Exiled, son, he get sent far 
 He's the foulest, QBC gat bust the loudest 
 Below profile, peep style, thirsty prowlest 
 Catchin court cases, pay for your legal aid 
 Son, that's money wasted, I ain't got time for that 
 Invest third place on my best sold rap 
 On the scrap from the ignorant cats 
 It'll be dead in a few... just like that 
 Couldn't bust his gat right (Yo, y'know what?) 
 But now you bucked your own man, amateur ass 
 Homeboy take that ass to class 
 But you cut in, duckin a reality blast 
 You catch a D minus fuckin' with New York's finest

 Dick riders, connivers bomb ya camp 
 We know survivors, push you off guard, got homicidin 
 We analysin, tell you up front ain't no surprises 
 We take you down first round, give ya man pound 
 Verse 3: Big Noyd 
 Check it out, dun, them niggas ain't ones 
 To be blowin' off the top and shit, I'm tired of shit 
 Dun, I'm about to dot the bitch and leave him stiff 
 Toss me the fifth so I can bless the GOD with gift 
 Yo nigga Noyd, what's the topic? Yo, the topic is this 
 Let me start from the beginning at the top of the list 
 First of all them tight niggas with that space-down shit 
 I stick a rocket up in they ass and give 'em a lift 
 My marvellous Mobb is tonic, intoxicant, bee-swee 
 Morphine raps, you get dope from inner mind-see 
 Shit fienin, now get your fix 'cause you need it 
 Fuckin' up your intravenous, the Infamous Mobb top secret 
 The only way you weakin is if you beakin this 
 Sneak devy niggas mischievous 
 'Knowledgin the GOD behind the scene on some snake shit 
 The vultures, water from their mouth but we can taste it 
 We just waitin with patience 
 Yo, dun, check the cross-examination these niggas fakin 
 So you can scream, you can fiend, you can dream for the bacon 
 Or you can snatch the Mac for the faggot, ai!

 About to take over, your area! 
 YO 
 Left to right protect the life, guard my castle 
 When goin' at you, take it to the gats if I have to 
 It's the hassle, jealous thugs I suppose squeeze 
 Turn that ass to Swiss cheese, leave permanent holes 
 And to them hoes, you know how it go, no dough 
 'Cause they subject to wakin' with cash and go crazy 
 Yeah they bangin' baby Havoc representin for them niggaz 
 That don't trick, ladyless, just associates 
 Appropriate, no doubt, but bust it 
 I love this rap shit got me fillin mad clips perhaps it's 
 Them fake rappers, but they damn good actors 
 From population, through the math I subtract them 
 You hear no laughter, QBC the thug factor

 Pitbull attack ya, and half snap ya 
 Kodak moments I capture, like an escaped 
 Convict, Pearl Harbor, bomb shit 
 Handle B-I, on some calm shit

 I can't get enough of it, the rough shit, grenade lyrics 
 My appearance is thug, rap slug ritual 
 For every dollar gotta nigga's blood chiseled, the slug sizzle 
 Pistol-whip tight, night monopoly 
 Four 380's in the prophecy, the bigger I got 
 Handle B-I, smoke a C-I, snuff a C-O 
 Can't You See, I'm the Total, vocals is low blow 
 Barely soldierable reinformed the man from Nahwan (Nahwan!) 
 Toe to toe complex the next expert, who's in control? 
 Episode, ya can't control your fascination 
 Hell is the name, two guns that look the same 
 Frame of thought change, first we live then we abort 
 Cloth Polo Sport, catch a nigga on his sports 
 Talk back I'll leave ya jacked, rap format, I'm hostile 
 Wild out for snakeness equals foul

 Chorus: Mobb Deep 
 Yo the NYC, M-O-B-B thug shit (and that's my shit!)

 We shut it down like the news and blast like fresh tecs 
 Out the box, we outbox, get suplexed 
 Take notes nigga, best check the index 
 Look over anything that you might've missed 
 You overlooked the part with some unified terrorists 
 Pirates, straight off the ship, and mad starvin 
 Anchored to land and now we runnin' wild poundin 
 On imbecile niggaz who ain't got they feet grounded 
 Precise, astonishin shots split ya skin's top 
 We sent pops, catch you from two blocks 
 Don't run up on you chargin, with hot shit, he felt it, alarmin 
 Shockin, surprisin shit, left you crawlin 
 Dangerous, umm, and ready to rock 
 This man's hot, your flesh start to boilin hot 
 Rhymes solid like a lead pipe, that bleeds your knot 
 Knot headed niggaz get knocked out a lot 
 Kick down your chain-locked door, we raise spot 
 My clique got a deadbolt lock, you rather not Duke 
 Stormin through the crowd, hard to see, comin' through 
 (Watch out, watch out, watch out, comin' through comin' through kid) 
 Spill my over-proof is drippin from my temple 
 Lay on the wall and watch all y'all

 Surrounded by crime cats, time for tap jaws 
 Leave red stains on clothes, carpets and floors

 Catch a buck fifty, them stars we scar well 
 Hard luck, got gassed up and starstruck 
 Then got stuck in one stroke, the Mobb clutch 
 Laid up, sippin all types of shit, get ya chick bent 
 Talk the bitch to death till there's no info left 
 Homicidal clepto, like the lye leaf I'm petrol

 Yo I rose early mornin, spread my wings yawnin 
 Vague memory of last night now it's all dawnin 
 Look down and see dry blood all on my garment 
 It stained all my Guess farmer's, colored enormous 
 I hopped up, outta my bed holdin' my head 
 Flashbacks of gun shots shot past my head 
 I can recall an eight man brawl three men fall 
 Bullets flew I had to drug my man behind a wall 
 Left a wet trail, delivered these slugs like air mail 
 Directly at the cat that made my man blood spill 
 An eye for an eye you know my science of life 
 Is you man or mice thugs or the cowardly type 
 I kick the 98 shit for your ears to list 
 Nigga P where you headed it's time to pass kids 
 (What's the kids be doin' yo) 
 Kickin' rhymes that's true lies 
 Let me break 'em down to size minimize they air air time 
 After this you never will go back to that which 
 Sit back an' write half ass shit 
 The last official takin' out the artificial 
 Let me relieve you replace that shit with some lethal 
 Mobb, remember the name it's been along 
 That nigga's shook to death from the first fuckin' song 
 Fluidly my mind flooded with jewels infinite 
 The kinda rap bandits in attics stuck on some live shit 
 Bear witness to this diligent street cat 
 I carry myself hold myself down in fact 
 This one dedicated to my niggaz on run 
 Holdin' big gats go for your gun 
 Prepare to crush them we trust none

 Professional, professor at this rap science 
 Up in the laboratory, here's why your small rhyme bore me 
 Store bought rap ain't shit, my category 
 Is that of an insane who strike back (what?)

 You wanna square off, forsake and slice that cat 
 You get splashed, from back of your head, to ass crack 
 Surgical signs to the end, with iron map 
 Which bring, apocalypse to this game called rap 
 Not a game but quite serious and yo in fact 
 You'll be runnin' for dear life so far you might fall off the map

 Scared to death niggaz fall to they worst fear 
 My retail's in braille, for vision impaired 
 You lookin' for P, well you can find him everywhere 
 In a project near you, I'll be right there 
 I was brought up and taught to have no fear (now) 
 Live wire niggaz stay behind me in the rear (now) 
 Cowardly hearts, step aside, stand clear (fear) 
 My bloodthirsty niggaz got they eyes on you 
 QBC, lime Bacardia, G.O.D. Father Pt. III 
 On some hashish, to Embassy Suite, crash your party 
 Chorus: repeat 2X 
 Verse Two: Havoc 
 Yeah yo, lime Bacardi, gettin' bent, crash the party 
 Handle B-I, bringin' it to anybody 
 Physical damage, crowd control handle cannons 
 Hittin you ripped, leave your bloodstream contamin-ed 
 While you actin' out of character, we observin 
 Drillin 'em down so hard, I know we felt you comin' at em 
 Hennessee raps float like the Phantom 
 Runnin' you up out of the spot in which you standin 
 Never second-guess a cat who hold gat 
 Concealed, but easily revealed and fast 
 Body castin raps to get your back snapped in half 
 And severed, impossible pain beyond measure 
 Sheisty living brought him to his last bread (bread) 
 Life changed around quick to one stead (stead) 
 Face full of fear, conquerin your ice grill (grill) 
 Tragedies, put him to sleep like NyQuil (NyQuil) 
 Givin' a overdose of this rap potent 
 Potentially dangerous, fatally left open 
 For the roaches, scavengers, that's EMS 
 Funeral homes, anticipatin your death 
 That's the dead truth, check in the morgue, you'll find proof 
 Enough to make you think and stop before your ship sink 
 To the bottom, night owl leave the mark and spot him 
 You know the routine, face up before I shot him 
 Chorus: repeat 4X"

 I got my clique ready, ready for hand-to-hand combo 
 Harms break 'em down, rapper Noyd cut his throat 
 Don swoop 'em up or Gotti stomp 'em out 
 Each twin grab a arm, pick this nigga up 
 Knitty turn his face to me, let me break him up 
 I throw him up against the wall and put a hole in his face so big 
 It almost took his whole face off 
 We got to take position, ready for faceoff 
 With blitz like Dallas ain't no Superbowl faceoff 
 We form like niggas in the yard up north 
 With long swords, ready for war, who paid cost 
 And take ya life lost, never found again boss 
 A job well done, relax, throw back fifths 
 Of Bacardi Limon, fifteenths of hash get lit 
 Fuckin' with the fabulous Mobb, yeah you were sick 
 Lunatic nigga jump up or got hit 
 With max and Teks and silencers spit 
 Shots whiz past your earlobe and shit 
 That's the sound of a nigga who almost felt it 
 Got you runnin', dodgin, coverin, shelterin 
 Bullets rippin through the fabric of ya shirt, it's meltin it 
 You bleed again, we just another nigga dealt with 
 Intruder Alert! Our house is nothin' like the Covenant 
 We hold big shit like a bitch hold one in the oven 
 (Havoc) 
 Well if it ain't drama, money above broke bitches 
 Simple minded niggas, Alpha have it positioned 
 That's opposition, wetttin me competition 
 Suddenly and outta tha blue and now I see 
 By myself, by myself and rollin' mad trees 
 Paranoid on point and now I see who's who 
 This thing was fake ones outta the immediate crew 
 Life I take one if you jeopardise my do 
 You're small mi-nute, gotta death to deal with aces up 
 You overbidded and in the Bridge you go stuck 
 This ain't a card game but in perspective it's the same 
 Put two and two together-Mobb Deep with one name 
 Contain drama like Outbreak, you order drama 
 We outtake and then take you out 
 Keep it real and throw the fake out 
 Raise the stakes up, hit you off from the waste up 
 That's how it is and how it is is kinda fucked up 
 Butter beats bangin' got ya whole clique singin' 
 On a corner while it's rainin, 4 pound left cha ears ringin' 
 Delete those and keep my shit discrete, niggas is trash rhyme 
 Totally offbeat and outta sync with they light 
 E & J bent tight, niggas slow ya roll 
 Ya ??? now ya bleedin tonight for no reason 
 Wanna be max and does get smacked, show no love 
 Crush ya team like the bear hug 
 The Infamous'll do dirt, dead as smear like mud 
 New York new get-it-greens, I feel no pity 
 No remorse, takin' it to the source of course 
 Bare that ass thug real kid, it's only your mask 
 That you wear, take off 
 Cop out feel the blast BOOM on top BOOM BOOM gat-for-gat 
 And all the rules got the drop on you 
 And let the nickel nine pop on you 
 (Prodigy) 
 Yo 
 My crew in the front got it locked 
 My live niggas in the back got the gats blowin' out'cha back 
 What the deal, what them tough looks and eye contact 
 Starin' all up in ya cornea, ya cornea lack 
 The look of a true-to-life, crime niggas attack 
 Go at the first nigga that front and overread 
 Ya get dealt with 
 Dealt with quick 
 Eye position get melted by hot shit, he felt it

39,Mobb Deep,hiphop,Shook Ones Pt. 1,"(Prodigy): 
 The most violent of the violent lest crimes we give life to 
 If these QueensBridge kids don't like you 
 We bring drama of the worst kind of enemies 
 Your first time would be your last earth memories 
 It's only your own fault 
 I gave you fair warning... beware... 
 Of killa kids who don't care 
 Unaware fools who be dealt with in time 
 It ain't a mystery 
 Hop on the words and rhyme 
 In nineteeth hundred and ninety square 
 All shook niggaz is supposed to have fear 
 Trying to get a piece of this pie we don't share 
 Prepare for the worst 'cause I been there 
 Try tah, keep a positive mind and walk a straight line don't work 
 So niggaz is forced to do dirt 
 And God made ... 
 So this jerk wouldn't hurt 
 If I listen to the lessons and the rules I learnt 
 On the streets for nineteenth years 
 And not leaving 
 My first priority is to reach twenty one breathing 
 Forever beef 
 Nobody would ever be even 
 So I grab the heat before breathing 
 Lost in this foul mind state 
 I can't keep straight thinking 
 But I keep my eyes on the earth without blinking 
 It's hard to be a man in this land of the venom 
 Any man try to front 
 He get slugs in him 
 Because... 
 (Chorus / Prodigy): 
 He ain't a crook son... son, he just shook one... shook one... 
 We live the life that of diamonds and guns 
 And numerous ways that we choose to earn funds... earn funds... 
 Some niggaz get shot, locked down and turned nuns 
 Cowardly hearts send straight up shook ones... shook ones... 
 He ain't a crook son, he just a shook one... shook one... 
 (Havoc): 
 For every rhyme I write 
 Is 25 to life 
 To all my peoples in the Bridge 
 Know what I'm talking 'bout, right 
 Ain't no time for hesitation 
 That only leads to incarceration 
 You don't know me, there's no relation 
 'Cause Queens niggas don't play 
 I don't got time for the he say, she say 
 I'm bigga than dat 
 Claiming that you packing gats 
 But you scared to get locked 
 Once you get upon the Island 
 Change your ways and stop 
 Thirteen years in the projects, my hard times of living 
 Wake up in the morning 
 Thank God I'm still living 
 Sometimes I wonder, do I deserve to live? 
 Or I am going to hell for all the shit I did 
 No time to dwell on that 
 'Cause my brain reacts 
 Front if you want nigga 
 Lay on ya back 
 I don't fake jax 
 Kid, you know I bring it to ya live 
 Stay in a child's place, kid you outta line 
 Criminal mind thirsty for recognition mission 
 I'm strictly sipping E&J like got my mind flipping 
 I'm buggin diggin ... over hustling 
 Get that loot kid 
 You know my motherfucking function 
 Cause as long as I'm alive 
 I'ma live illegal 
 And once I get it 
 I'ma put it on my people 
 React quick to lyrics 
 Like macs I hit... 
 Your dome up 
 When I roll up, don't get caught sleepin' 
 'Cause I'm creepin' ... 
 ...You just a shook one 
 (Chorus / Prodigy): 
 We live the life that of diamonds and guns 
 And numerous ways that we choose to earn funds 
 Some niggaz get shot, locked down and turned nuns 
 Cowardly hearts send straight up shook ones... shook ones... 
 He ain't a crook son, he just a shook one... shook one... 
 We live the life that of diamonds and guns 
 And numerous ways that we choose to earn funds 
 Some niggaz get shot, locked down and turned nuns 
 Cowardly hearts send straight up shook ones... shook ones... 
 He ain't a crook son... crook son, he just a shook one... shook one...

 Yo, the saga begins, beget war 
 I draw first blood be the first to set it off 
 My cause, tap all jaws lay down laws 
 We takin' what's yours we do jerks rush the doors 
 Here come the deez tryin' to make breeze and guns toss 
 In full force, my team'll go at your main source 
 We're not tourists, hit bosses and take hostage 
 Your whole setup, from the ground up we lock shit 
 Blood flood your eye, fuck up your optics 
 Switch to killer instincts for niggaz pop shit 
 Yo nigga Noyd what's the topic? Nine pound we rocked in 
 Ninety-six strike back with more hot shit 
 Illuminate my team'll glow like, radiation 
 With no time for patient, or complication 
 Let's get it done right, my click airtight 
 Trapped in a never ending gunfight so niggaz lose stripes 
 Or lose life, jail niggaz sendin kites to the street 
 Over some beef that wasn't fully cooked, finish 'em off 
 Well done meat, that said twenty-two slug to your head 
 Travel all the way down to your leg 
 Chorus: together 
 Aiyyo it's hell on earth, whose next or gonna be first 
 The projects is front lines, and the enemy is one time 
 I ain't gotta tell you 
 It's right in front of your eyes 
 (Repeat 2X) 
 (Havoc) 
 We wreck the QBC, nigga rep yours it's all love 
 Milli stacked down, heavenly guarded by hollow tip slug 
 Then crack down, on wannabe thugs adapt to gat sound 
 And bow down, slow the fuck up, see how my foul now 
 Articulate, hittin body parts to start shiftin shit 
 Never hesitant, it's the crack game unlimited 
 Summon rasta we can do this, forever infinite 
 Then reminesce, twenty years later how we was gettin' it 
 Either with me go against the grain you better hit me 
 Leggin me or robbin me niggaz better body me 
 'Cause it's a small world and niggaz, talkin' like bitches 
 Bitches singin' like snitches, pointin you out in pictures 
 'Cause she rep the QBC faithfully, playa hatin' me 
 All that bullshit, is just makin' me 
 More the better, then concentrate on gettin' chedda 
 If shorty set you up you better dead her, I told you 
 Shape and mold you, Sun you, then I hold you 
 Like a pimp mind control you double edge blow you 
 It'll be I, like I'm supposed to, the click is coastal 
 International to local, Bacardi mix physically fix 
 Hit you with shit, that'll leave a loose nigga stiff 
 Probably thick, Son I solved em 
 Pulled him in my world then evolved him to chaos 
 Walk the beat like, around the way cops the average pitstop 
 QBCity GodFather Part III, Gotti Gambino 
 And Ty Nitty, Scarface rest in peace 
 (Prodigy) 
 Yo, the heavy metal king hold big shit, with spare clips 
 You seein clips when the mac spit your top got split 
 Layin dead with open eyes close his eyelids 
 Turn off his lights switch to darkness, cause deep in the abyss 
 Is street life, blood on my kicks, shit on my knife 
 Youse the wild child, kid cold turnin' men into mice 
 I was born to take power leave my mark on this planet 
 The Phantom of Crime Rap, niggaz is left stranded 
 Shut down your operation, closed for business 
 Leave a foul taste in your mouth, like Guinness 
 POW niggaz is found MIA 
 We move like the special forces, green beret 
 Heavily around my throat, I don't play 
 Shit brand new, back in eighty-nine, the same way 
 The God P walk with a limp see, but simply 
 To simplify shit, no man can go against me 
 Test me you must be bent G, don't tempt me 
 I had this full clip for so long, it needs to empty 
 The reason why it full for so long, 'cause I don't waste shit 
 You probably hid, blood in your mouth, so you could taste it 
 Quiet as kept, I lay back and watch the world spin 
 I hear thugs, claimin that they gonna rob the Mobb 
 When they see us, I tell you what black, here's the issue 
 It's a package deal, you rob me, you take this message 
 Along with that, I ain't your average cat 
 Fuck rap, I'm tryin' to make CREAM and that's that 
 Whatever it takes however it gots to go down 
 Four mikes on stage a motherfuckin four pound 
 Speakers leakin out sound and niggaz leakin on the ground 
 I could truly care less the God will get his 
 Regardless blow for blow let's find out who wear hardest 
 This rap artist used to be a stickup artist 
 Sometimes I test myself see if I still got it 
 A live nigga stay on point never diss 
 Regard shit or forget the essence, from which I emerged 
 P is sick, so save that bullshit for the burbs 
 Live up to my word, if I got beef, niggaz comin' in herds 
 We flush through your click get purged"
41,Mobb Deep,hiphop,Give It Up Fast,"Verse 1: Nas 
 Got out the airport, the Mobb pick me up in the truck 
 Jury junkie like fuck, I ain't scared to get stuck 
 So what's the deal poppy? 
 You heard the feds almost got me 
 I had the Cuban posse all up in my room and lobby 
 Negotiatin like an Illuminati network 
 Don't catch a body experts and retrospect till the foul connect 
 When I lost but back then was my fault 
 Now it's time to floss 
 Eye For An Eye what's mine is yours 
 I need a suite with the flowers 
 Complentary at Trump Towers 
 Sit at the table we can build for hours 
 On gettin' riches, a cinch, take a glimpse 
 The World Is Yours written all over the blimps 
 Here's a toast to my foes, it's like a whole new beginning 
 From ??? and prima, loads of women rockin' linen 
 I got a plan to blow the Hiroshima, Japan 
 Movin niggas out tha hood and just divide 'em with fam 
 Ay yo, the bitches like G Money said to us, man 
 About the dick like the horse with the cowboy brand 
 Give it up fast, quick and not slow 
 Not goin' to the tables if it's not about dough 
 Son you know Mobb Deep is runnin' this shit 
 QBC, nigga grab your click 
 Verse 2: Havoc, Big Noyd, Prodigy 
 Yeah son, I'm feelin' it 
 Opposition want me dead, concealin shit 
 Four gats got me livin', kid 
 Rushin through my pyramid 
 You secondary, go against the grain then you adversary 
 Had to bury niggas on my side, that snitch 
 Ran his mouth like a bitch 
 Now he's layin in a ditch 
 Daily dug for himself 
 On his grave I had to piss 
 Scud missile never miss you 
 Hit you, scratch you off, we left Jim Star rip through 
 You metal deeper, you ain't havin' it me either 
 It's drama, ain't got time for no breathers 
 Rapper Noyd make these niggas into believers 
 Huh, huh 
 Hey Noyd, what up this cat right here, man 
 Word up! 
 The tough guy strong me 
 I guess he got plans to ruin me 
 He want ta do me slowly but surely 
 I beat his fast ass a bit early 
 Grabbed the biased raid, the shit was curly 
 Put the drome to his dome 
 Let him know it's never early 
 You can slide before I snatch the heat from his side 
 Saw the devil in disguise by the look in his eyes 
 He was surprised I snatched him up 
 Regulated his gat and backed him up 
 Stepped to the side, P blast 'em up 
 Hey yo, cannons are rough 
 You got strucked up, ya strokes slit 
 So rapper nigga playin' thug try to pro shit 
 (Yo, kill that nigga, man!) 
 All I remember was I shot for his throat G 
 You see big guns and 3-D is haunting 
 It gets deep, fuckin' with these Chi-nese 
 Thai weed burnin my hip from hot gats 
 Burnin my lips from roach clips 
 Catch me on 40th and Bootlegger in the a.m. 
 These *?R-tape meridiam?* cats, insomniacs 
 Four in the mornin we throwin' back some Cognac juice 
 Lettin gats loose in the blue van blitz-through 
 These kids too couldn't find the pistol 
 Ay yo, I got the Lexus, holdin' my necklace 
 I'm bent off some next shit 
 Gasoline wick, a kerosene twist 
 Stumblin, place of my gun right, it's slipped down its calibre 
 Lookin' for chicks that he can stab now 
 Numbed up for my fiery cup 
 I held juice of sin's nectar 
 Saints found they youth 
 Mega-action, bitches all around ready to fuck 
 Big asses, you bought all the shit, pressin ya luck 
 My pipe games like a night train 
 Top speed through ya warm piece 
 ??? To say the least 
 Give up the pussy fast, quick and not slow 
 Not goin' to the cell if it ain't a freak show 
 Said you know Mobb Deep is plannin this shit

 Satisfaction, guaranteed real shit 
 Rapper Noyd, we meet you at the top kid 
 And once we all on top, ain't no stoppin' it 
 I'm headstrong, at peace with myself like Islam 
 You stupid, a hundred niggaz form around me

 The crew is worldwide, to think we started from the Hill

 How we bubblin, hustlin, break you days in 
 Grimy motherfuckers, gettin' info from your baby's mother 
 Got her pillow talkin' while that ass was sleepwalkin 
 So all that bullshit you did, I know where you live 
 You better be on point when you walk in the rest 
 Your broke ass probably don't got a vest 
 So I suggest change your location is best 
 Because I'm comin' through army fatigue dressed 
 Blessed with hollow tips yes, to burn through your dirty ass Guess 
 Yes, still shinin', still climbin

 Hey yo, yo Tommy, word break the fuck off what is you tryin'? 
 His faggot ass cats'll get capped for even tryin' 
 You tried to confront me, but only faced iron 
 From holes to your shirt like Jamaican clothes 
 Fuck the miss, the science of numbers is how I live 
 If we ain't gettin' mathetmatics somethin' got to give 
 Broke for your fuckin' life with nowhere to live 
 Is no way to live, resort to Plan B 
 Start to stickin, strong-arm robbery and ice pickin' 
 It's sneak vickin, it's cold outside I think it's 
 Past time for me to grab the clapper and take mine 
 You follow what I'm sayin' it's like leadin the blind 
 Tryin' to voice a clear picture of this life of crime 
 You slow learners'll understand in due time 
 Up the ladder of success with tecs, we tryin' to eat 
 And put that fly shit on my back, and bless my feet 
 With some new and improved, spectate or make a move 
 Hesitate or regulate it's on you

 Dreams of growing old with my son and live great 
 Little man I'm plannin to enhance your mindstate 
 The rebirth, of a nigga who lived an ill life 
 The one before me was of an even more trife 
 My understandin, I'll raise you with precise plannin 
 And put you on to the whole game of this planet 
 But I gotta survive in order to follow through plans to live great though 
 Me and my lil' kitko, any man tryin' to stop us he get wet though 
 He couldn't withstand the snake bite, there is no antidote 
 Don't you put your hands too close and try to approach 
 I won't snap at you I'm goin' for throats 
 And when you feel my bite 'cha sing high notes 
 I peeped you from deep and then you got cut close 
 My formulae-I live life do or die 
 Stare into the eyes of a deep wiseguy 
 Prodigy turnin' niggas to protoges 
 My protege I advise ya ass to make way 
 Make way... for fully-auto gun spray 
 You're small prey, I'll easily bait and trap yeah 
 This man is half mad scientist-half sane 
 Creative rhyme labryinth like poisonous cannabis 
 Here take a toke of this daily rare vocalist 
 Overpower y'all, tiny noise like locust 
 Like sunlight through a magnifying glass I'll focus in and 
 Burn a hole straight through ya brain and leave ya open (Oh shit!) 
 And let the venom soak in 
 You start sweatin and goin' through convulsions from dope shit I write 
 Leavin' niggas stuck, I let spit 
 Trapped up in a web of a nigga that's sick 
 I'll wrap you up in cocoon, you caught up in the midst 
 It's dangerous as risky business fuckin' with this 
 Contender number one I put you on top of the list 
 You're the best challenger so far I'll give you this 
 But peep this (what?) fatal shots that soloplex 
 Man down, now who dares to go next? 
 Like General Monkmonk orders to chop necks 
 I send a message to my whole clique to bomb shit 
 Atomic, no time for calm shit 
 We hyperactive and it's time for Vietnam bit 
 Ya whole alliance gets single handedly bomb-ded 
 Take heed to the apostle's warning

 Yo Ty Nitty, airforce one's call up my duns

 You don't want none, lump some 
 Exort niggas for they lump sum no doubt 
 Proceed, where that weed indeed 
 Havoc laced the track razor sharp, you bleed

 My whole mission, like a platoon take position 
 Ain't goin' in if my clique can't get in 
 That's word to mines have you stressed like jail time 
 Get that loot up, no doubt I bail mines 
 Easy access 
 Shorty straight up hit the mattress 
 Have you role playin' just like a actress 
 My tactics leavin' niggas stuck doin' back flips 
 I black out 
 Take it to the gats 
 Fuck this rap shit 
 Let my niggas shine 
 Rate my rhymes like a dime 
 Swollen bullet wounds, head ass niggas

 Who's the one to be made into example 
 Nigga you pop shit wit the wrong guys this time 
 What! (gunshots)

 Got juiced up, now bishop think he thuggin' it black pimp 
 Let's rap a taste 
 You get your little head pinched off 
 Brooklyn touched you, then left you for Queens to finish off 
 Fuck a ----- Keith Murray and his whole clique 
 Yeah, you snuffed me in front of the cops, that bullshit 
 Told you come around the corner, no police and no witnesses 
 Little to your knowledge 
 You almost got shot but that's aiight though

 It's kinda bugged how I dose sometimes 
 Know they staring, Brain feels like the wheel lost without the ball bearing 
 Stuck, Contemplating who I can trust 
 But like lleullo in a bill my feelings just get crushed 
 That's why I stick with my duns, like I stick with the guns 
 Don't get mad, Rip your hun, concentrate on my funds 
 Lift heavy gats concealed by my waist 
 Never get patted down when I step in the place 
 Jiggied up, scope the spot, Confirm beef, if it's not 
 Rally up, after this get followed straight to the crib 
 Gem Star, double edge apply pressure 
 Shave 'em down, Blow marks intruding through your mecca 
 Wanna be a thug, now you got the thug look, 
 Stick 'em up, leave medicaid, with the bill to foot 
 God-Body, With a rubber grip black shotti 
 Pump one in the dash make a nigga switch hobbies 
 A dosage, hand delivered, without postage 
 Bring it to your door step quick on short notice 
 Niggas get sniped like, clog your bronchite 
 Show 'em how to rock right, when bitches are holding mics, street life 
 Why'd you have to raise me this way, You showed me how to survive the concrete, for how long who am I to say, forever you a part of me (Street Life) Why'd you have to raise me this way, I'm surprised we alive today, how long only time will say, forever you a part of me

 Big Noyd 
 This is something you feel nigga, like the theme song from Hill Street Blues 
 This is real, this is ill street news 
 How he gone, and left his moms mind struck 
 Now his brother ain't giving a fuck 
 Little sister giving up the butt now, Dun don't wet that 
 I want you to rest black, cause you better believe Noyd gon handle that 
 'Cause when I get em, I'm gonna have em 
 Pull out the sweeper, and spray it at them 
 I'm no killer, you know me 
 But I'll be damned if I don't ride for my co-d 
 And then this OG, scold me, and told me, coldly 
 You keep it up and you will be dead like your homey 
 But I gotta redeem, get this cream by any means 
 I never been clean 
 Nigga, my whole click got dirty 
 From the vials, to the trials, to the bloody absurdity 
 Nigga you heard me 
 Its Gangsta 
 Prodigy 
 Vision the canvas I paint a picture 
 Similar to Ernies Barnes nigga 
 But mines is more ghetto more guns 
 More drugs, mostly thugs 
 All my duns, their baby moms daughters and sons 
 Dark blocks, with streets lamps shot the fuck out 
 Park benches broke, a nigga stretched out 
 Jumped off the roof to his death its real 
 Hand Ball walls displayed with R-I-P murials 
 Those who sling, play the shadows by the building 
 Devils spring, keep 'em going while the snows blowing 
 Grams get dipped, 50's are moked, cookies are broke 
 And Spliced in large pieces for the fiends to smoke 
 The sun set looks beautiful over the projects 
 What a shame, it ain't the same where we stand at 
 If you look close you can see the bricks chipped off 
 Sometimes niggas miss when they lick off don't get clipped off

 Yo my rap taste good in my mouth like Deer Park 
 For your ears to list-this 
 You don't wanna miss this dun 
 Don't be a statistic 
 Keep your rhymes to yourself, we make fools out of niggas 
 And write shit that would certainly move y'all niggas 
 PEACE to my summer villains with pink houses 
 >From Red Hook to QB you know the routine 
 We need a movie to show how our life is so ill 
 Every Summer in the projects we partied on the benches 
 Few gallons of gin and pepsi 
 Remember Party wars, that was back in like 90 
 We use to roll o-wees now we stuff dutches 
 Kids rushing, what's your discussion 
 Y'all niggas talk alot of shit heard you on your tape fronting 
 I fake nothing, Fuck around and push the wrong button 
 I dedicate my days to seeing your drip blood 
 I will always love Gambino and ScarFace 
 Killa Black no man can fill your shoes, Now what's bad news 
 It couldn't get no worse, So what y'all niggas know about the turmoil 
 What ya know about your blood soil, Clothes and little Ho's 
 And the legs of pant slugs that crack the shin bone 
 The Other shot blasts through your left clavical 
 Melt swizz suits and paint the avenue's 
 Havoc 
 How you want it? Bent Scheme or straight blunted 
 Many are rare, rore, Havoc has just over done it 
 While you sitting there whispering like a little girl 
 Fuck, waiting around till the dutchy gets twirled 
 We going at you, not 'cause we want to but 'cause we have to 
 To avoid the situation that you couldn't last through 
 If I can't have it at all I don't want it at all 
 Off top serious dogg, I'm out for the raw 
 Back to the world, the shit that I kick will dazzle your girl 
 Handle your bitch, can't then take her for pearl 
 Get him with the pink slip, get him bent to he hurl 
 Hennessy got my mind locked, tight in a curl 
 Hold it down like Saddam you can't search my click 
 Even with dirty worms I'm gonna still appear 
 How you want it, bent scheme or straight blunted (2x) 
 Cormega 
 Yo, my pen is sick like a heroin add-dict, Whenever Mega spits 
 Exhale preciseness, Drug Dealer Ghetto shit 
 Sweat in my hand, plus the finger numb from mesasuring grams 
 Gun on my waist, In case I see son 
 Who wetted my man 
 I be Gortexing to death, rocking ice with special fx's 
 Obvious I was destined to rep 
 Yo my persona is the drama, my Infamous Congrommalits 
 Considered mad real, niggas feel the Montana shit 
 Born official, my niggas that are gone I miss you 
 I shed a tear, see y'all niggas when I get there 
 Yo my dun did six years and still didn't hit the strip 
 I'm waiting on the day, when Rikers Island ciphers are incomplete 
 When I can sleep with no heat, hidden beneath the sheet 
 And I can relax with my air max, appearing on my feet 
 When I rhyme you enter my mind, Seeing nigga's lead to excellence 
 I represented then manifested in the beat... Respect this 
 Like a lexus jeep 
 My technique 
 Leaves my enimies stretched for weeks, vexed from me 
 Especially they know my destiny, man they scared to death of me 
 Can't even question me, I serve them like stretching ki's... please

 No matter what the fuck you think 
 Got cash in my escrow, never gonna let it go 
 (Hell mothfuckin no!) 
 Chillin' at the crib layin in my boxers 
 While shorty got bent spittin' tha latest gossip 
 Didn't want to hear it in the middle cut her off 
 Lit a stog, smacked her ass, grabbed her by the draws 
 Bugged in the head but her looks turned me on 
 She tried to turn me on with edible thongs 
 Plus I like the way she sounded when repeatin my songs 
 From Queens to get to her crib didn't take long. 
 Said she had a man but was lcoked up in Attica 
 Freak off with the VCR to my camera 
 Afterw that shit that happened to Tupac. 
 Yell rape? Show 'em the tape jus playin' my part. 
 Opposed to being on tape but the G that I ran 
 Had her tongue in my ear and my dick in her hand 
 When I thought I knew I shoulda brought my fam 
 Bring her to the lowest level and shared it with my man's"

 I'm from a place where the realeast niggas get murdered 
 And the illest niggas try to avoid it 
 But can't call it 
 It's a cold world bundle up 
 Keep your heat on at all times

 Dick-riders, wanna get 'em bullshit 
 The same law, same day contract, different clause 
 Don't run red lights, I never caught the blue balls 
 Gold medalist spit, doin' this ever since 
 Third time felon nigga, who you tellin'? 
 Chorus One: repeat 2X

 Y'all niggaz is trash rap - wanna fight me? 
 You shook to death, take breaths and step lightly 
 Y'all Little League niggaz is so bald they might be 
 Spent too much time with wifey, come out to play 
 With the hard-headed, Infamous song torture 
 Crack your knuckles, buckle up your pants tight 
 Pull your hats down, let's get it on like papi bar fights 
 My spiral book, hold the world's most lethal 
 There's no cure, for what my pen do neither 
 Bring the fever, y'all niggaz is the rap Justin's 
 While we was gone for a moment, y'all kept the crowd goin' now 
 Move over bacon, time for som'in meatier 
 Your shit's weak, your best song was mediocre 
 Fuck a penis, how dare you entertain the thought 
 That you could come out to challenge me in blood talk? 
 Take a walk jerk this ain't Levert, Sweat and Johnny Gill 
 This is rap for real, somethin' you feel 
 You catch a chill when you hear the Mobb bang through your stereo 
 It's heavy metal for the black people, rock'n'roll 
 But it's hip-hop though, my drug music 
 It's thereapeutic to the user, you slam dance to it 
 Chorus Two: repeat 2X 
 Nigga we Infamous, ashes to ashes till death do us

 Cause ain't no love when a nigga shit is touchin his ribs 
 Hungrier than a hostage, shit, we blitz 
 In formation pack the led up in shit 
 The better you get, the better we get, and that's it 
 Yo this snake's in the grass when they bite Mobb anti-venom 
 Stop 'em in they tracks, goin' at 'em when you send em 
 Imperial dogs, creepin' through fog 
 Carved needle slip and you fold, the shit's lethal 
 We roll Mobb D-iezel, the whole Q.U. double-E, N-S 
 And when you spot us, play low-key

 Dunn these niggaz is actresses, and they tryin' to play the man's role 
 Can't they see us wildin on the video? 
 Don't they see us in the club swingin' elbows? 
 Or on the street with our jewels on the cell phone? 
 Hoppin the sidewalk with Benzes and Jeeps 
 I ran through more cars than it's sand on the beach 
 I'm pleased to meet you, now here's a word to the smart 
 Don't ever let your peoples boost up your heart 
 'Cause you'll fuck around and get your ass torn apart 
 Challengin the Mobb in the arts 
 Our literature stands collossal, compared to y'alls 
 Way ahead of your time, you're strugglin to keep up

 Straight ass cheeks niggas be askin 
 For ass whippings 
 Guns kick like pelle

 Often lay a man down on the floor when it gets like that 
 I'm not blowing off rounds so you can hear sounds 
 So you can run back actin' like you a vet 
 And swearin' you dead 
 You survived some real shit 
 Now what's this it's not going down like this 
 Ground y'all niggas like punishment 
 Dumpin' out full clips when we dumb out 
 Though I'd rather do music and chill the fuck out 
 Dun you bugged out I'm trying to walk a peaceful route 
 But niggas always got mouth until that piece come out 
 Niggas always gonna think something sweet 
 Until they least expect you bringing action exactly

 Point game track y'all merk like a jaguar nascar 
 And be out buck 80 on the slow mar 
 Hennesy spillin' all over my radar 
 Stay charged niggas getting amped off the mobb shit 
 Have you wildin' out on some club shit 
 Fit to make you dance at the same time 
 Stop and glance 
 Slap flames out the nigga with the wrong idea 
 Young shit with young mind but that quite contraire 
 Young nigga smart nigga 
 Who started from the stairs 
 How dare 
 You try to come around the way 
 In fear like a nigga that been there for years 
 Shout words that we live but don't play with it 
 'Cause when the shit go down you be like they did it

 Shit like mine I'm a rare species 
 You's a dime a gross 
 That's a dozen heast the least 
 Keep silence the most 
 Regulate with the rest of my establishment 
 Blast out the pockets of coke 
 Make the cops boat 
 I break down your whole background yo 
 Irons a permanent flesh your clothes soakin' 
 You feel the shots pain every heartbeat throbbin' 
 Don't get excited you'll only make it worse fighting 
 Spent most of my nights graveyard shifting 
 Make burial grounds be that man grim reaper 
 With all pleasure 
 Pick your feet up 
 Pick the heat up 
 Let's do it like the crematory 
 Make it hot make the temperature rise like mercury 
 (Havoc) 
 When I feel like getting' bent (Yo don't fuck with it dun) 
 Imma drink away the pain until the brain get numb 
 Can't take all my dogs getting lost in the fog 
 Never to return I guess they heard god's call 
 And nature don't surprise me now 
 Prepare for the worst and never believe the silver line clouds 
 Scrutinize crowds 
 My surroundings 
 Get suspect we start four-poundin' shit 
 Picture me up in the mix 
 With the next man broke and is on my dick 
 A good man of plenty but an enemy it was clear 
 I just be another problem that he feenin' to fix 
 But I can't have that 
 Pull out I try to grab that 
 Caught one nigga like Mahadat

 Strapped with infa-red raps when I hit the traps 
 Crack the wack into pieces when I hit the track

 South style waiving my motherfuckin soldier rag 
 A hard illustration of my brutal lifestyle 
 Memphis Ten made a lot of niggas buck wild 
 The root to all evil daily I chase it 
 Blow it on weed and drink then hustle to replace it

 To all my gold grill niggas and my trail niggas 
 South to east we keep it hard for them real niggas

 Moms filling out surgery cards blowing her nose 
 Wiping her tears cause something on your top got shot 
 Should have brought alone wit you what you loaned on the block 
 Fuck, leaving without it dunn I'd rather get knocked 
 Charged with a ten body for a nigga get shot 
 For a weak ass bitch, fuck that little whore 
 Even though she get my dick harder than the parol board 
 Stick and move, slide in, slide out big guns 
 Mack milly prepare to mob you steel phillies 
 Connected with Eightball dunn so what's the drilly 
 Out to take it all if you wit me then feel me 
 Don't get yourself shot 
 Bleedin to death hops

 A maverick my H-K will work magic 
 You'll find yourself in the O-R for talkin' that shit 
 Street justice I tip the scale over cousin 
 I hold more weight you just a no name nigga frontin 
 Get your hardware lets treat it like a contest 
 And we can dance till one of us drop from being hit 
 Murda Muzik my street life influenced it

 A renegade crack your top like devil spring 
 Vigilante niggas know the song I sing

 A nigga like me hold tecs, are you the same too? 
 Goin' through the emotions, of gun holdin' 
 Long shotguns down my pants leg limpin 
 Killer bee who still livin', even my pops too 
 He taught me how to shoot when I was seven (yup) 
 I used to bust shots crazy 
 I couldn't even look because the loud sound used to scare me (POW!) 
 I love my pops for that, I love my nigga D-Black 
 I'll take the life of anybody tryin' to change what's left 
 And through all of that a nigga ain't scared of death 
 All y'all brand new niggaz just scared to death 
 I spent too many night sniffin coke, gettin' right 
 Wastin my life, now I'm tryin' to make things right 
 Grand open some gates, invest, in Iraq business 
 Do things for the kids (the little Dunns) 
 Build a jungle gym behind the crib, so they can enjoy youth 
 CBR's and VCR's 
 ATV's and big screen TV's, nigga please 
 Don't make me have to risk my freedom 
 We worked our whole life for this, you get your shit beat in 
 For real... (yo)

 That nigga P-Double got that shit 
 For y'alls peoples to rock to, stirrin up pots of brew 
 In hell's kitchen, I chef the impossible 
 To serve hot plates all across the unified states 
 Sit down and sup with top rap reps 
 We the streets that's watchin boy move diligent 
 You better walk like a nigga on the tight rope Duke 
 Infamous first infantry, first division fourth mission 
 First assignment -- give 'em that shit they been missin' 
 My new edition's way bitch 
 Those that listen, get addicted to my diction 
 Fuck rhymes I write prescriptions, for your diseased 
 Generic rap's just not potent like P's 
 One-thousand one-hundred CC's on the throttle 
 I peel off chest naked on Katanas 
 Spaghetti head Mobb niggaz is full bred 
 Fully blown melanin tone, I rock skeleton bone shirts 
 And verses, but thirst for worse beats 
 So I can put, more product out on the street 
 Get respect and love, all across the board 
 We've been adored, for keepin' it raw, nuttin less or more 
 I score every time for sure 
 While the rest of y'all niggaz just nil

 Ain't got no worries for y'all niggaz man... y'all niggaz is crazy 
 (Prodigy) 
 Hey yo, its hell on earth down here the pavement scorching 
 Its more on roc when the Mobb walks in 
 Shit gets hot like a ill pot of grits spilled on you 
 Spit fire with nines but never squealed on you 
 I understood you should try to take my life 
 If I was you I would too damn right 
 If I had drama with a nigga like such as myself 
 I couldn't even sleep at night until... 
 I made things right 
 Pull out guns exchange a fight 
 Be the first to let off mines ignite the pipes... 
 And never let the daylight deceive 
 During the suns' hours niggaz do bleed 
 Aim for the waist and something on the top gets shot 
 Niggaz can't shoot never made a thing drop 
 Keep cream of the crop 
 Fresh out of box shit filled to the top 
 Smell the barrell when its bolt-locked nigga

 If Your real; He'll forgive me (no doubt) 
 But I ain't crying no more about how you're gone 
 Used to hold me down niggaz front its on 
 Ain't wetting going to jail you better shoot me 
 Just lost my heart-If I die you comin' wit' me 
 Quickly while I'm pissy they're just bitches that's a little to frisky 
 Risky on point hope these cats is getting the point whisper out my name 
 Stand but please don't point call me paranoid 
 But I'm on point close by the stash joint Got you in my mind 
 I guess that's why the say love is blind

 On top of rules big barells and tools get tested 
 And hittin off makes my dick get erected 
 We all strive for a better tomorrow 
 But as far as today your ass gotsa' pay 
 And ain't no time better than the present one at hand 
 And never keep your shit too far from your hand

 Think about this are you with your hands on who you running with 
 Some timers, Playa' hata's and dick riders 
 Bent niggaz' that be crashin into dividers 
 Gettin' you into shit got that ass tied up 
 Got them la'd up got you comin' out of your vault 
 With no plans of giving back live in serious debt.

 Yo, if I sat at wrote a verse for all the niggaz I hated 
 Most definitely, if not you, kill somebody belated 
 Sound foul with a subject, dunn, no women or kids 
 Dump you up under a bridge in a cardboard box 
 I'm like nothin' to do wit it, believe it or not 
 I'm washin my hands to get bent with Henney or rock 
 Up in the rep bangin' my chest off, pealin my socks 
 Niggaz do it to death, I sleep with my 6 cocked 
 Like Henney rock, one sip, ya love it a lot 
 While you sleepin', I'm creapin wit the intricate plot 
 'Cause picture me up in the morgue, way before my time 
 Picture you tryin' to get my while I'm still tryin' to get mines 
 Asshole, have ya brain lookin' like Castro 
 Dunn, I heard you wanted me (be careful what you ask for) 
 Bitch, if I buck you, damn Short snitched 
 The nigga just mad 'cause he can't cop crisp 
 (Raekwon) 
 I observe the dread, winter time, big shot in my leg 
 Blood barrels, a big thick Benneton keg 
 Razor glass full, salute all teflon, shoot wit the left arm 
 We sleepin' wit nukes, the blood is shed warm 
 High-voltage guns, nuns wit jums in the gums 
 Razors, lazers, bulletproof blazers 
 Yo, remind what the team chanted 
 They bought the jewel from a don wit a king-sized hat on, slanted 
 Kangol wit Bentol, ya mental, mid-war 
 Spill Hen' in the store, that's for the own' 
 Blaze wit a bent 4, yo these laws is your's 
 When we pour gasoline all in ya pours and draws 
 So deceivin, flow speed change, lay him down, empty breathin 
 Instead of these leaks, we leave the weak weapin 
 Operation: apparatus, spray shots through ya grey Stratus 
 Straight up status for maggots

 Soldier boys stay on ya toes, be on ya P's and Q's 
 Keep ya eyes bright comin' out ya buildin, duke 
 You might bump into a bullet or stumble on ya death 
 Niggaz slumber, I put 'em in a deep coma 
 I keep guns 'cause it's like that, you figure it out 
 I got an arson for niggaz tryin' to figure me out 
 You ain't a killa, you just talk more, runnin' ya mouth 
 The type of nigga, we'll stomp out and bloody down 
 Look, we a Mobb for real, don't let the LP's twist it 
 Cut me a cheque 'cause I don't talk business 
 Drop anthems worth millions and spend millions 
 Take trips with my niggaz to the Keys on the weekends 
 Serious jewels, pissy off the fruits 
 Dunn, we move like the marines, move when we come through 
 Seduce bitches dizzy, half they friends and they moms wanna hit me 
 Y'all know my stiggity

 The infamous all around and you know we get down 
 So everybody hit the ground before you hear the loud sound 
 Thug muzik, thug muzik (2 times) 
 All that's loose leaf, my big game 
 Scrow foul lives, snake eyes 
 Ready with steel at any given time 
 I'm a kill, stone-hearted nigga at will 
 Done this shit real, riddle in a life appeal 
 And losing again for real like -Armageddon- 
 Tech sweating your direction 
 Your face change applection 
 My whole life been destined, to show as the moon, shape cressin 
 Caressing these raps like backrubs and bath tubs 
 I'm blessed, mics of all types learn their lesson 
 Live from the strike -deadly- 
 Like gas chambers and pengas in jail 
 You know the dreal, QB on the hill where I chill 
 41 side still real, it ain't gone change 
 My niggas think long range crack the skull frame 
 Simple and plain fake niggas want claim fame 
 Real niggas up north, the Vack Sing Sing 
 It don't make a diff don, first nigga if done 
 We hit done, make it so shitting up, run up with my gun up 
 Nigga you be done up right, QB at the end of the night 
 Take a serve 
 What's your position? 
 Trying to come at me sideways 
 But they ass backwards, jealousy- that's all that is 
 I see that shit a mile away, but it's all gravy 
 One little glitch and your plan getting hit baby 
 I got enough for you butt niggas laying in the cut 
 Like a pit never give up 
 Character ass, amateur ass, damage your ass 
 With a touch of class handle that ass 
 Two aluminum bats, ruin them cats, to explosive gas 
 Doing them cats, my crew's in the back 
 Losing it black, I be that bold cat, shine him with the black gat 
 Hitting it close to my back, my whole click stay strapped 
 On some Queens bridge survival shit, we strike like that 
 Full force, we blast at your main source 
 As I sit back don, I think about my past 
 When my moms had no cash, and my first time catching crabs 
 Or at the time when my brother got splashed 
 It hurt my ass, to see him pass 
 But now I gotta keep on moving to get this cash 
 You better kill his ass, if you wanna pass 
 The premicise for the minister's kid 
 Called the infamous 
 Forgive but we never forget 
 All that fake snake shit, could I never regret 
 'Cause I learn from mistakes that be guiding my steps 
 But we pull out and cock twice nigga 
 When you least expect 
 It's Murda Muzik, real life situations, placed on the paper 
 For all you cats rapping acting like it can't happen 
 Nigga we the most infamous, my team 
 Glows in the dark and clicks the dullest 
 Overconfident niggas get punished 
 Take a number and get in and get on line for drama 
 You whiling like you was one of my own 
 That shit don't mix, we clashing 
 Make moves, handle your biz 
 Gun po's, take action, reach for those 
 Long chrome noses -up- my gun blows 
 Your legs turn noodles, you shot a few going down 
 I give you that much, you ain't out 
 Close but no ci-gar, you must be a fucking retard 
 Extending your arm in my direction 
 You better squeeze hard, my rank is that of up most respect 
 You niggas only know what you heard on cassette 
 Manifest words in a flash, niggas only see the light 
 After they bleed a few pints 
 Take your most VP don, leave them like the letter T 
 You won't see me run, unless its police 
 Now take these words home and think it through 
 For the next rhyme we write might be about you don 
 All you niggas so confuses, this is giving you Thug Muzik (2 times)"

 Man I want niggaz to hear this shit right here 
 Knahmsayin? Cause these niggaz be forgettin son

 But umm... we gon' take this little intermission 
 To say what the fuck we got to say, y'know? 
 (Let me, let me here something then) 
 It's like this Dunn

 Infamous till the name wear out 
 Time and again without doubt 
 I take the murder one route 
 Why clowns pulled out and copped out 
 Poppin' they, little heads out they hole 
 Stickin they chest out, actin' like they in control 
 But hold up, I've been doin' this since we was kids 
 And all you other niggaz gotta ask if you could live 
 Your projects is on our dicks, you need to quit 
 And let us rep that for them, your raps ain't shit 
 Your background's incorrect, your song push no effect 
 On the people, don't try to play my part 
 Don't try to say my words that I lived and survived 
 Y'all niggaz got some nerve, be careful at night 
 You might bump into a tru to life nigga like Pee 
 Get beat over your head wit gun handles 
 Check the manual you went about it all wrong 
 We put you on the life, taught you how to drink right 
 And how to speak like anigga livin' street life 
 How to chasee down liquor wit more liquor 
 As a youth I was over proof, now I'm sober than your hoa 
 But still pound on a nigga till he throw up 
 Straighten up there's too much to lose 
 Get your head on right, we got the world to gain 
 And I'ma take mines while you sit around and complain 
 And I innovate raps while your song is playin' 
 Looks tastes and feels to me like no frills 
 Take that bullshit back to the two inch reel 
 Hit the studio hard, crash the track board like a smashed car 
 Then maybe next rhyme you could fuck wit the God 
 Pee wit a capital ""P"" 
 And don't ever in your life try to rock wit me 
 On no days there's no rap page I can't top 
 I, splash the half ass trash you dropped 
 You get chopped in half, your little raff ain't last long 
 My shit came out and you got escorted to the door 
 You just a fuckin' clown here to entertain us all 
 I bring the gravity Dunn you're gonna fall 
 Anytime y'all niggaz wanna mic brawl 
 Don't forget to me it's bloodsport bring your dogs

 Never allowed, and break 'em up like a whack album 
 Go against to get punished, fuck you 
 Take it out on who run wit, then touch you 
 Ain't no room for the both of us you pop too much shit 
 I just handle shit and put a clamp, on them loose lips 
 I sink 'em like the Titanic, you be deep in some shit 
 I didn't stutter can't hear nigga read my lips 
 Who you runnin' wit - shit you won't knock this click 
 You just frontin wit imaginary pies you flip 
 Aiyyo Pee my mind and yours put together's like a pack wild pirahnas 
 Carnivores it's me thirstin 
 It only worsen, you cats'll get the closed curtain 
 While your catch me on your networkin, you dick jerkin

 Move the crowd do my thing leave your ears aroused

 Others got blatant disrespectin' the rest 
 Or so young that you wouldn't even expect 
 To be burstin' off guns like a vietnam vet 
 On the steps 
 Sittin' in the staircase bent 
 Thinkin' on ways to take another man's head

 Chorus: Nas {singing to the chorus of Brandy's ""The Boy is Mine""} 
 Y'all need to give it up... we don't give a fuck... 
 What y'all niggaz want... thug, life, is, mine 
 Y'all need to give it up... 'cause we don't give a fuck... 
 What y'all niggaz want... thug, life, is, mine 
 (Prodigy) 
 I got the style of a still-born child, I'm ill 
 If it's beef, poke him with the fork, make sure he's done well 
 (Very very) The sreets raised me crazy, now I'm immune to it 
 So when they start shootin, we'll stop the music 
 Keep it moving that's how we do it (c'mon, c'mon Dunn) 
 Been through more drama than the Baldwins, you still crawlin 
 (Still crawlin) Apply street rules to the office, high performance 
 Rap author, made millions off of - melodic, hypnotic productions 
 That'll fuck with your conscience and touch your emotions 
 (You feel me? You feel me?) 
 You feel me? I'll write a graphic page 
 Escort niggaz to they grave, relate to the projects 
 We the black Mobb, it gets deeper than rap music 
 (Don't get no realer than this!) 
 It's more real than any words I can muster 
 Pull the black Cadillac trucks up (What?) 
 Hop out them shits like what? Y'all niggaz can't touch us 
 (Nas Escobar) 
 Silk shirts on my chest show what a flirt 
 Halle Berry blew a kiss at the Barbara Streisand concert 
 Silk pants colored pink, gators match gangster musical thing 
 And I'll front like my doo doo don't stink 
 Instinct like Cuba Gooding steppin out the latest toy 
 Hazard lights blinkin, gators hit the floor 
 Everybody watch the red carpet entrance, cameras flashin 
 Just to think, that was yesterday's action 
 Cause today goes either way - we came a long way 
 From hallway steps and hand-me-down shit 
 Fuck my foes, I seen the other side, NexTel cell roam 
 Call the chopper phone, heliport in my home 
 Quincy Jones posters 
 Wake up, guns under my pillow, I can't talk around chauffeurs 
 Shit is better than a novel, autobiographic 
 Spit it on tracks, it becomes classic 
 Start some, make my heart pump, spark one, I'm God son 
 NAStradamus, last one to blast one when the NARC's come 
 Know how to leave anything in thirty seconds 
 When you feel the heat, comin' and flee with the murder weapon 
 I'll release one, shot you deceased, learn your lesson 
 Your flesh turn to maggots, bastards, you past it 
 Cremate your flesh to ashes 
 You don't need a suit, no wake, no funeral, and no casket 
 (Nas) 
 The, life, is, mine (repeat 3X) 
 Ill Will... 
 You need to give it up... we don't give a fuck 
 What y'all niggaz want... we don't give a fuck 
 Thug, life, is, mine 
 Y'all need to give it up... we don't give a fuck... 
 What y'all niggaz want... thug, life, is, mine"

 Bad apple outta the batch, obsessed with gats 
 Since a little dude, eatin niggaz food, buck-fifty's

 Pull strings have you gettin' clapped and things

 Any nigga threatenin my life's a done deal 
 Watch a bitch get her filll then she snitch and squeal 
 Blow a nigga have 'em leakin to the court of appeal 
 Serchin for Hav is like a search through fog 
 How you like to make a last pit stop at the morgue

 (Havoc) 
 My niggas in NY know the game 
 Bitch front, she gettin' out on the shoulder lane 
 It's 3 in the mornin', why you think you came 
 Should've stayed where you was, I don't play those games 
 Ring on the finger, fatty off the meter 
 There's only one thing that this shit could lead to 
 The reaction, your mind'll crack 
 And put my man's on if it's poppin' 
 Bitch you laughin'? 
 Everything that I spit is real 
 And everything on your inside you scared to tell 
 The word creep, ""no"" ring a bell 
 Girl I know the situation all too well 
 I'ma keep it gangsta, rep the 'bout 
 Lady caught on, so I had to bounce 
 With bleach in the crib, all my clothes got doused 
 That's when a nigga knew I had to get out 
 Know what you're goin' through, been there before 
 Relationships now, it's like they got these laws 
 Girl all you wanna do is just be free 
 And that's why a nigga like me got these keys"

 Have ya janitor 
 Pumpin' your (X5) merkin 
 Skid marks the street 
 Your heart skips a beat 
 Beef? Nigga overcook that meat 
 Get no sleep, only rest is 
 In between the blink 
 My life story was 
 Written in blood, permanent ink 
 Killer instinct, R.I.P. 'em 
 Gotta think like that 'cause 
 Forever I be needin' 'em 
 Plan flawless, mistakes 
 Never repeatin' 'em 
 Some love, some hate me 
 B****es in the head beatin' 'em 
 (So) 
 Niggas wanna ride 
 By the crib all slow

 I got niggas all in my face 
 It get serious it ain't no game 
 So I got to keep that thing at my waist 
 (Havoc) 
 Which part of no games niggas don't understand 
 Your dealing with one dead serious black man 
 Whose first resort is to squeeze, second thought to breath 
 Love this freedom so you know how I be 
 And why these niggas want to pull me in 
 I ask myself that same question over and over again 
 It's a small world my girl, I'm smashing a friend 
 Ain't no love lost might as well join the fuck in 
 I've been telling niggas how my gangster get 
 You can trace it all the way back to the infamous 
 When niggas out now was on infamil 
 Fuck a hotel nigga was fogging a windshield 
 Wrecking my first wheel they was barely bulking 
 Now this dun language is the motivation of their talking 
 A hate in my blood you won't find one drop 
 But let a nigga stunt and he will get dropped 
 So 
 (Prodigy) 
 Yo dun what up scream at your dog 
 These niggas been wilding since niggas been gone 
 Fake niggas stunt like their really that strong 
 You really that bitch nigga pussy, thongs 
 P that nigga that will break your jaw 
 You get jumped by a mobb of niggas for sure 
 Who get cut bucked and left for dead 
 We get fucked sucked and extra bead 
 Partying with the ladies is crazy dic 
 Make you want to have babies and eat the fish 
 You won't feel safe in the same place as us 
 We make niggas want to stay far away from us 
 We make bitches panties wet, they pray for us 
 Want to see a nigga live and be safe as such 
 We back with more of that murda muzik bitch 
 I'm going to bang on a nigga that confuse the shit 
 (H) That thing is closer than blood and thicker than water 
 (P) You niggas is like fleas and guns pluck 'em off dun 
 (H) Scratch that itch then get rid of that bitch 
 (P) Then we mobb out with the sixes looking sickening 
 (H) That's when beautiful whip we tearing the streets up

 I'll noose y'all, and push y'all off the edge 
 I'm like Ray Benzino 'cause how I hang men 
 I got a big caliber gun inside of my Timb 
 So I can explode on any mothafucka that grin 
 Trust me, it's not like that, it's not what you thought 
 You'll be like ""P shot me and bounced in the Porsche"" 
 On some real live Mobb shit, Columbo, the Cappo 
 I pop niggas, leave the gun right there, I got gloves 
 Stop niggas from frontin', leave 'em real fucked up 
 I drop niggas that's runnin', shoot 'em in they back dun 
 Coward ass nigga poppin' all that shit 
 And when them things popped out you on some Michael Johnson shit 
 Fuck that, hammer that nigga to the earth 
 Wanna cross me? you niggas gotta pay that toll first 
 And I got change for all that million dollar shit 
 And these slugs'll be the only reason niggas be hollarin'. 
 (Chorus (Havoc, P, and Noyd)) 
 Turn this shit up, pump this shit up, DJ mothafuckas burn this shit up, 
 We hurt niggas 
 Twirl that shit up, burn that shit up, don't make me have the Nine spit 
 Up, I gives a fid-uck, I hurt niggas 
 (Verse 2: (Havoc)) 
 I'm tired of tellin' niggas how the fuck I feel 
 You know the steel'll put them niggas to sleep like Benedryl 
 These trash ass rappers and they faggot ass friends 
 Talkin' like the bitches, walk around like they Men 
 Niggas like y'all don't get no respect 
 This is Hav', I die once, y'all niggas die a Thousand deaths 
 Cowards, you tryin' too hard to be 'bout it 
 You know them niggas that be fake be the ones to shout it (Holla!) 
 Talkin' this and that, but check 
 Turn around and get robbed in they own projects 
 Might as well be rappin' on stage for them 
 Bitches be baggin' you, 'cause you the one feminine 
 The sound of these guns got 'em shook, it's a rap 
 You could see the yellow stripe runnin' clear down they back 
 And let a nigga find out where you live at 
 And then blow that mothafuckin' piece of shit off the map. 
 (Verse 3 (Prodigy)) 
 Whattup son, dun, surprise nigga, that's how we pop up on 'em 
 You off point you die in your sleep, that's the moral 
 Nigga, you know we get our contraban in 
 Smokin' that dangerous, you know we got bangers 
 You know I'm dead real, I don't know what you was thinkin' 
 I'm all over the street, you better stay creepin'

 If I'm fuckin' your 'burb, just maintain cool 
 'Cause I won't take a el, whether in your crib or the outside world 
 Cause the pound clap well, like fan mail 
 Choose to ignore me, the warning that I gave 'em 
 Get at me, you and what army? 
 The fashion-ass niggas you hang with, have a plate of graveshift 
 Man down, nigga it's the same shit 
 Niggas like kids and I don't play with 'em 
 Go get your father, nigga, the smart decision 
 And I'm picking niggas off with the sharp precision (pow)

 Knives and forks, ain't no time to think, it's on 
 Just move on them niggas with excessive force 
 And don't stop till them niggas don't move no more 
 Broken hands, nuckles and gun handles 
 Dunn got his gunshot wounds through his mantle 
 Informers tell when snitches snitch, 
 Fuck them, buck more shots, get out that bitch 
 Cribs is found, careful when the kids is out 
 Torch your house, stalk your kin, bitches and friends

 It's fucked up how it goes down, innocent people blown down 
 My niggas is here, brace yourself

 From the gate I keep it real that's why the god love me

 When I say I'm going at you it's a giving when I spit it 
 So niggas talk out the ass amongst those who live it 
 So niggas get money bounce from the hood and shit it 
 So bitches fuck niggas, they man best dog 
 Over that now you got some nigga leaking on the floor 
 You gotta watch those broads 
 To die over that is totally against the grain and against street laws 
 I respect paper and every minute that's spent gettin' that shit 
 So my little dunn could be set 
 And what I feal about a nigga that's trying to pose threats 
 Never write it out if you can't cash that check

 This man?...where we headed for the future man... what's the resolution? 
 (Verse 1: (Prodigy)) 
 Wealth, health, and happiness nigga 
 Keep me from runnin' 'round clappin' these niggas 
 Sometimes you gotta just handle your business 
 Fuck it, it's on me, rounds of shots for niggas 
 Punk, I wake up everyday to cathedral cielings 
 Jumpin' out my bed, wall to wall marble and pillars 
 Livin' like the pharoah Tut, I'm blessed with life 
 So I breathe deep and give praise to the most high 
 Then I, get fresh for a new day 
 I eat broccoli for breakfast and smoke my trees 
 Turn on the flat screen to C-Span 
 See the elite strength, attorney general slowly gettin' bills passed 
 Prophecies comin' to pass 
 We gotta survive this shit dun, it's nothin' to laugh at 
 I hops in the V, grabs the heat and I stash that 
 I'm in tune with Doc, Pac, and Huey, it's a rap. 
 (Chorus (both)) 
 I traveled the World, and been alot of places 
 Believe me dog, ain't nothin' like home 
 And if you want somethin' done, you gotta do it yourself, you got drama? 
 Who's gonna clap that chrome? 
 Nobody like you, somebody like me 
 When death I'm ready for it in Threes 
 And me off point? c'mon now nigga please 
 I'm paranoid, you know I'm burnin' those trees 
 (Verse 2: (Havoc)) 
 Saw alot of niggas die, some niggas survived 
 And those that did did it by the skin of their hide 
 Dodgin' that long ride, the four-fifth aimed at 'em 
 And knew to fall back when them slugs came at 'em 
 On the real, for me to be here tellin' y'all this 
 Is like dice, then I rolled that Four-Five-Six 
 And never lost ever since, though I took that big pinch 
 My Brother passed away, 24/7 I was bent 
 Drunk in my pain, alot of friends went and then came 
 And those that stayed understood a nigga pain 
 And for a niggas problems had no one to point the blame 
 I was my own worst enemy goin' against the grain 
 Somewhere along the line them pieces had to get grabbed 
 All this money plus family, shit wasn't that bad 
 All you little shorties runnin' 'round like shits sweet 
 Just remember these words from the M-O-double-B. 
 (Verse 3: (Littles)) 
 I kiss my finger, cross my heart, I'ma make it out these dark days 
 Whether together or we part ways 
 I got a promise to that boy tatted on my arm 
 Three strong, man, the heat's still lukewarm 
 Who can you trust when your friends wanna pop your safe? 
 You let him stash in your place, now you watch his waist 
 Vision the days, hear the ghost whisper 
 Dogs we left in the past, brought back now here with us 
 Cross my heart, let the haze linger 
 Pour out a little liquor, knowin' God took a good nigga 
 Thousand dollar slippers skirt from the scene he was just a worker, dog, 
 You were his every dream 
 I kissed his face like I never knew 'em 
 It was me, once upon a time when life was ruined 
 Now the mink rope chain sparklin' 
 Jumpin' out of bed, Thousand dollar slippers slidin' huggin' the 
 Carpets."

 Cockin' and squeezin' and 
 Afterward that nigga still be breathin' and 
 Who gonna snitch if you lucky to leave it then 
 For a reward nigga just might turn you in 
 I take it further and I might just murder him 
 That mouthpiece all together 
 I'm curbin' him

 It's very real 
 Ain't got no time to pretend

 Yo 
 Feelin' it thugs 
 I dump a magazine on you dunn 
 I'll run up on you niggas with the ?master? glove 
 Dunn there's nothin' for me to snap and get on tilt 
 I know it's nothin' for you 
 The pain to have me killed 
 I respect the laws of war and love 
 I live by them shits 
 Y'all niggas not ready for this 
 You not knowin' how you about to get your head crushed 
 Spray it dunn 
 Straight out 
 Shit it when them guns come out

 It's hard just to let things ride 
 Maybe one day things will change 
 As of right now let me show you something"
79,Mobb Deep,hiphop,So Long,"(Verse One: Havoc) 
 Why the fuck did your your ass have to go and get knocked 
 Now you got me on the phone, straight talkin' to the cops 
 Tryin' to verify your government 
 They got you now, they lovin' it, 
 They wanna hang that ass, couldn't get you in the past 
 Though I can't see your problem 
 You was still young at the time 
 Did a lot of older things, you was ahead of your time 
 Never told you to slow down 
 Resee your crown heights, you wild 
 All I could say was be careful 
 Give you a dap to bounce 
 Shit that you went through 
 Watched the drama amount 
 Gave a fuck long, you wasn't part of the body count 
 Now I feel guilty, half the blame of your incarceration 
 Till the interveine, when you first started catching cases 
 Fuck to this, dunn, now you in there 
 Gotta hold it down, you mother's only son 
 And I'ma ride for you, baby, 'cause a lot of it is still love 
 I'm still there, when you get home, I'ma be there 
 (Chorus: Havoc (4x)) 
 You gotta (hold on) 
 No matter (how long) 
 And it seems (so long) 
 (Verse Two: Prodigy) 
 I can't believe they got my dunn, it feel like my fault 
 'Cause I fronted you that money to get that dough 
 Any man's ain't accountable for they action 
 Still and all I feel responsible for you being gone 
 I hit the mall till it happened, k.a. now and then 
 Just so, you can live and keep your little cosmetics 
 In that five years, it was a little dough we made 
 Out of sight, out of mind, naw dog 
 It's not me, I miss you 
 You on my mind daily 
 Even though I scribe to a nigga, really, you feel me 
 Trying to get my shit together 
 So you could be proud, when you touch down 
 We got businesses to run now 
 Peep it back how we used to run up in a nigga's house 
 On some pety crime shit, boy we was not playin' 
 On occasion, I still check ya, brotha 'tll the end 
 Black, and bone crazy ass 
 Reading ya letters, I see you ain't losin' ya sense of humour 
 Talkin' to you on the phone made my day cooler 
 Tellin' me, how you'll deaf, to see your nose out 
 You need to bring your black ass home 
 And cut that bullshit out 
 I could remember me and killa would test our new guns in the projects 
 'Cause that's where police won't come, iller g 
 My nigga till death do us 
 You almost home, until then 
 Hold ya head, dunn 
 (Chorus: Havoc (4x)) 
 You gotta (hold on) 
 No matter (how long) 
 And it seems (so long)"

 Yeah you know the shit don't stop, never, never 
 As we continue on 
 With more of this drama for yo' ass 
 {""She asked me why..""} 
 You niggaz always startin somethin' 
 And beefin with rappers, why our music so violent 
 And so dramatic, where's the love? 
 Why y'all go so much static 
 Is it real for real or all for sales? 
 I'm like, ""Shorty you must be sick"" 
 We been gettin' burned like the Waco kids 
 I don't need to diss rappers for recognition 
 You better check the files: Infamous, Hell on Earth, Murda Muzik 
 You can't be SE-RIOUS 
 We created this drama shit, we set the trend 
 We taught you niggaz bout diamonds and guns 
 And numerous ways we choose to earn funds 
 We veterans, we got a decade of albums 
 Niggaz done came and went, and we still poppin' 
 Our name is carved in stone 
 Even the new blood know, we ain't no joke so 
 Let us solidify this - what's that? 
 We been solidified this - but of course! 
 Lot of new rappers and young kids - uh-huh 
 They all love +The Infamous+ - but of course! 
 We been for this music Dunn - c'mon man! 
 Who do it better than us? - c'mon man! 
 Who continue to bang and bump? That's right

 Without the headlights, case niggaz know my whereabouts 
 Wanna, snuff me out, I ain't finished with life 
 I'ma, thug it out, front you payin' the price 
 And I'm a nigga who can roll the dice, put up the crib 
 Won't sweat if I lose, bet your ass won't live 
 To collect this splurge of mines, never that 
 I'm a sore loser the (?), reverse with hammers 
 Hit your man's up if they press the issue 
 Some dead, the other half crippled, and I'm a monster with led 
 Lodge a slug in your abdomen, puts in the 7 
 Knowin' in the stash box a rapper's best friend 
 Get it twisted and you WILL get twisted with chrome biscuits 
 Make no difference my nigga, we handle business 
 So please with the questions they right in, front of your face 
 Homey stunt he gettin' to' from the gate, so 
 (Prodigy) 
 Nigga that you used to click with turned on you 
 Idiots you used to rap with hatin' on you 
 Did you really get juxed for half a mill' in jewels 
 At the video shoot? I tell you this boo-boo: 
 My stick-o's still my stick-o 
 My stick man be my stick man till the tombstone (mmm, mmm) 
 You got rhymes? You got stomach for the Mobb? 
 You got stomach for P? I get my rocks off 
 (Havoc) 
 Believe nothin' that you hear and only half of what you see 
 Niggaz never cooked in the kitchen and never clapped heat 
 Niggaz wanna be thugs but on the inside so sweet 
 Niggaz butches on they records but they never handle beef 
 Know nothin' bout golden seal, seein your P.O. 
 Gave a dirty urine now you're snuffin a C.O. 
 Fuckin' right, I'm a man of the people but I will kill you 
 If you cock-blockin the paper the shit'll get real dude (so)"

 And here we go again 
 Y'all callin in reinforcements 
 The Mobb come through, stop up the shit 
 P'll come through and shot up your vest 
 Shoot at your head, not-a-leg eh? 
 Nigga I will kill your bitch 
 Then fuck her and make you watch 
 We do thangs, like raid spots 
 Probably catch you on the Hummer, just give you my glock 
 (Here) Or most likely in the club, we gon' give you them knots 
 This is what gangsters dance to, or turn to a thug party 
 Once we step foot in the bitch, it's on again 
 Outside we got them boxy trucks 
 Hoes wanna jump, cause of that Benz emblem 
 The hoe say she wanna ride in the shit with the horse logo 
 I got her out of her panties and boom boom 
 And I done left bitches out in the boonies 
 Frontin on that pussy, leave bodies wherever 
 Niggaz tryin' to kill me? 
 (Chorus: Havoc) 
 Yo, we livin' this till the day that we die 
 Survival of the fit - nigga we still alive 
 We livin' this till the day that we die 
 Survival of the fittest nigga, and we still alive 
 We livin' this till the day that we die 
 Survival of the fit - nigga we still alive 
 We livin' this till the day that we die 
 Survival of the fit only the strong...

 No doubt, my niggaz hold me down whenever in beef 
 Talkin' all that bullshit but it's the hammer that roast 
 If your shit ain't clappin off then you sure to lose 
 Aiyyo the streets don't give a fuck about you 
 For you ain't bendin the rules 
 Come around lookin' icey then you runnin' the jewels 
 Nigga you ain't gotta like me, homey get your food ate 
 The whole plate, rip a fella ear to ear I'm talkin' his whole face 
 And scream my name, cause it hold weight 
 You cowards are jealous 
 Glass slipper wearin niggaz we call 'em Cinderellas 
 Gonna be a slug shower and there ain't a umbrella 
 That can help you protect that ass from gettin' wet 
 I can see it in your eyes, your bitch ass is pet 
 Home team I'ma promise and you cowards ain't a threat 
 Introduce a fella to death, in the form of chrome 
 Nigga, now you in the danger zone

 Yo, yo, it's like this Dunn

 How we can get this money, we need us a payday 
 Dig in my pocket, it's nuttin but change 
 I dig deeper, but still comin' up wit change 
 So we, called our lawyers to fix this shit 
 He said it's aight, we bout to be Free Agents 
 Have patience, we can't though, we need paper 
 Like thirty-five million'll straighten us up 
 It's nuttin for us to make these songs that bump 
 Shit that out, then tour for like six months but... 
 This can't be life, this can't be all there is for us 
 We need more cream to splurge 
 Thinkin' back, how we used to pick herbs 
 Me and Hav' in Manhattan, stickin up cowards 
 For they wallets and Starter hats 
 For anything worth somethin', we beat 'em out of that 
 But fuck all that, we grown men, we need Porsches 
 We need Porsche endorsements and more shit 
 Yeah Dunn, that sound righteous 
 I feel stressed though -- so I just 
 Hop in my truck for a drive 
 Bring my nine, cause that's how I stay alive 
 As I peel in my Jeep, turnin' up this 
 Goin' through withdrawal cause man do I miss 
 A pint of E&J, some haze, a twist 
 Me and Hav' on a flight to Rome witcho' bitch 
 Yes, that's my favorite shit 
 But without the dollars it don't make sense 
 So I, write that shit that grab you 
 Hit up the studio, that's how we get paid in full 
 Yeah - that's what we get paid to do 
 The next contract we sign'll be monumental

 Uh-huh, yo... sittin' contemplatin on plans 
 Like a bomb with a short fuse with this gat inside my hand 
 I need paper, lookin' at these stick-up kids 
 Got me thinkin' 'bout the previous things I did 
 Gettin' bent up, feelin' fed up, whattup Dunny 
 Stomach touchin, niggaz over here type hungry 
 Waitin on my turn just got me hyper 
 And impatient, maybe I might just 
 Lurk with my forty-five, if you outside 
 I advise yo' ass to hide 
 We talk with the heat, lettin it spit 
 Move out the way and you can STILL get hit 
 They wonder why I'm riskin all this cash I made 
 Put your feet in my shoes you gon' see it my way... 
 So niggaz wanna stunt it's cool 
 My stomach never full, and I will eat your food

 Shit, till them fuckin' flamers empty out player 
 Cause boy I thought you knew, don't confuse me with the music 
 I'm on loadin nines up, ridin' up, shootin it 
 I'm hotter than the corner on the ave out in Newark 
 I'm grimy, you find me where the loot is with Lugers 
 The bodies, the hotties, the hustlers and the shooters 
 With dudes that'll cut ya, that's what eatin your food is 
 Fools know the rules pull out your tools better buck it 
 Cause niggaz be flaggin and braggin when they cut up your nugget 
 Knee deep in the grind like 'fuck it' 
 We gotta keep it real son that's only how the people gon' love

 And learn to respect the Infamous to the death kid

 (Feel me) While everybody was chillin' 
 I was broke like a motherfucker, loyal to my vision 
 Knowin' that I'd be on top or somewhere close to it 
 Nigga, my livin' quarters'll be the thing to prove it! 
 And vowed once I got there to never ever lose it 
 Let my, head get big and slack off on my music 
 I'm the illest! 
 (Chorus: Havoc) 
 ""We done seen it all, done been through it all yo"" -> Prodigy 
 I'm the illest 
 ""Let y'all niggaz know right now, word to mother f'real"" -> P

 ""Let y'all niggaz know right now, word to mother f'real f'real""

 You know I... 
 Come through with that seven-four pound I 
 Voice activated, know these whities just hate it 
 Thinkin' I'm a drug dealer, how else could he cake it? 
 BITCH, my shit legit, plus I invested in stocks 
 So if this rap dough stop (yeah) the show won't stop (uh-uh) 
 Believe me there's more ways than a few to make it pop (word) 
 You gotta have it in you, bring it out once it's needed (yeah) 
 Be strategic, live it shit it and breathe it 
 I won't stop till I'm famous, hostin shows with Regis (that's right) 
 It's my world, my game won't be defeated 
 (C'mon, give it to me give it to me) 
 Keep them checks comin', thoughts flowin 
 Words blowin', hoes goin', Havoc always holdin' 
 First one to fuck in back of the Porsche truck 
 Lord knows how many babies that chick coughed up 
 If you asked my enemies they would say it was all luck 
 That's why you see, mixed emotion when my name's brought up 
 'Cause I'm the illest 
 (Havoc) 
 Yo, you know you ill when you can kill two birds (yeah) 
 With one stone alone and slowly emerge 
 From the deep depths of jealousy and envy's domain 
 Make chips then stash for the days it rain 
 Never cry and survive the pain (that's right) 
 Though shit looked impossible, to an, eye untrained 
 Nothin' to lose, and know the game, be proud of yourself 
 Remind yourself, say it to yourself, say it 
 I'm the illest"

 And any little thing y'all pussy to me 
 Like ki's in a coke drought, double it chief, you fucking with me 
 Said you gangsta? 
 Shit laying dormant or something 
 Cause you ain't killing nothing, letting nothing die (Not at all) 
 You that same old nigga getting fucked in your mind 
 By that raggedy ass bitch that you call a dime 
 And when it comes to the Mobb you know its beef all the time 
 Out your rabbit ass mind you know I clap-clap-clap mine 
 I know the rap's leaving nigga crooked getting out of line (yeah) 
 If I catch homey looking the wrong way, Good-bye 
 Cut and slice 
 Then let your man cut in your life 
 Evicting your ass out of your life (Get the fuck outta here) 
 You just a broke ass nigga knowing you don't got it 
 Better get up off your ass and bump that

 Come through busting the gauge 
 Huffing and puffing the haze 
 Merck something for real

 Down for the murder and all that so come our way 
 Down for the slaughter and down to pull a kamikaze 
 Get nazi on niggaz like Wiley did to grandpapi 
 You'll mistake me for a beast how I smack beef for lunch 
 The drama is all a movie 
 You selling wolf tickets, I'm using guns loosely 
 I'm not paranoid, I'm very truly 
 Dangerous, you knock my pimp cup down, I shoot peeps 
 And snatch jewelry 
 Murder braids thoroughly 
 Fuck what color you flag 
 I'll blast through your pagely 
 Get a warning from me 
 Blood still gotta drip 
 I don't send death threats 
 I produce the source bitch 
 Polka dot skulls and holes through they headrest 
 They wanna be dope, we give them a fix of this 
 (Chorus - Starting with ""That haze..."") 
 (Verse 3 - Havoc and Prodigy) 
 Homey must got it confused 
 Talking about he hitting me up 
 Sounding like he sniffing that stuff 
 Running his jib 
 War with Hav' is like breaking a mirror 
 Homey it's on for life, fuck what you hear about these seven years 
 My nine slug will alter your mind state for real 
 After that party like a nigga home off a pill 
 You a grown ass nigga you can do what you feel 
 Can't knock the way a nigga eat his meal 
 We got garbage bags full of that (Narcotic) 
 Smoke like the sun splash concert 
 It's chronic how we kill these beats and run these streets of death 
 Now finally, we getting our paper, yes 
 We touched our first millions when we was just kids 
 But now we 'bout to take this shit to new brackets

 Thought she had me handled 'cause she tattooed my name 
 I see you niggaz schemin my niggaz I see you comin' 
 You lookin' at a nigga whose stomach is used to touchin 
 What's really good with you homey, you think you know me

 Tougher (?) letters on my hand, spells what I stand for 
 Flip on you and your man's, for speakin' on my thugs 
 Hop out the trenches on niggaz, they runnin' from us 
 P hoppin fences and benches, avoidin them slugs 
 Real slow when they back out, you cockin shit back 
 I got one in the head and I'm turnin' ya hats 
 Then I spit what I want you to know with these raps 
 Albums sellin like drugs, we gettin' it back 
 Bodies wrapped in Versace quilts, home invasions 
 Bitch-ass niggaz is found in the basements 
 Smoke with the family, and spill drinks for our dead 
 Drive in the backseat, fucked up your lady head 
 Rolled back up the window, and then we slid

 It's chemical warfare, we spread through the hood son 
 And attack the nervous system 
 Make niggaz bop they head and turn that shit up 
 Make the ladies panties wet, you know we get 'em 
 Hot and bothered, girl I have that oyster drippin 
 On stage flippin, catch us on tour

 Burn something, I wanna clear my mind 
 Look at niggas 
 Burn something, gotta get my lungs out the shop 
 Niggas need that, it's happenin' to take me to the top 
 (Prodigy) 
 They must be jokin' niggas get they face peeled open 
 Guns we unload em, Mobb fixtured omen 
 Plus, we hit mid-sections up 
 You wit your kids and your woman boy I'm tearing you up 
 You wit your moms, so what I'm airin' the block 
 When you see my hand reach for my waist you better hop 
 And do not fuck wit P, you goin' at me 
 You better off shuttin' the fuck up, trust me 
 You got a better chance stickin that Brinks truck 
 Than pickin' one of us for a hug 
 We properly serve 
 Reugers pop and whop ya head 
 Pens go off and drop you dead 
 Aiyyo Littles what the fuck is the deal my nigga 
 Fuck all this rappin' shit let's ride on these niggas 
 Cause this song ain't for entertainment 
 This is a street subpoena for y'all niggas bring it 
 (Havoc) 
 Niggas knows the deal we clap hammers and shit 
 Bitches love us but niggas can't stand the clique 
 And dyke women, these motherfuckers running off emotions 
 Burn something, I'm ves'd ready to hurt something 
 Niggas knows the deal we clap hammers and shit 
 Bitches love us but niggas can't stand the clique

 Whatchu know about two hands three guns pop out 
 Them city boys that be movin' 'caine down south

 I been around since Dappa Danns, rap vans 
 I'm a gorilla man, I know you feel me man 
 Queens I rep you flow let's do it 
 Unknown marksman, I see through the scope 
 Hit your frame and your souls apart and 
 Number one question A & R's wanna know 
 Where I stand in the dispute wit' Nas, Mobb and Jay-Z 
 Fuck you pay me 
 I slid in on you rap motherfuckers cause the block got lazy 
 I'm from a place cannons burst, police never come 
 Homie viewed my life, wrote, and got us out the slums 
 Came home, the Mobb came to scoop me up 
 Though I rhyme niggas still wanna shoot me up 
 I'm that gangster gangster read all about me 
 In your X-X-L's, Sources my crew is rowdy 
 When them hammers back out we leave the whole block cloudy 
 (Havoc) 
 Burn something, I'm stressed ready to hurt something 
 Burn something, I wanna zone while I'm merc'n niggas 
 Burn something, gotta get my lungs out the shop 
 Niggas need that, it's happenin' to take me to the top 
 Yeah burn something, I'm stressed ready to hurt something 
 Burn something, I wanna zone while I'm merc'n niggas 
 Burn something, gotta get my lungs out the shop 
 Niggas need that, it's happenin' to take me to the top 
 Relax my mizzy and smoke that dro 
 Hold her head motherfucker I'ma fuck that ho 
 Let the dutch burn niggas get split fuck ya turn 
 I ain't been givin' a fuck so why should I now 
 Watch your mouth, nigga I'm grown you just a child 
 In a man's world nigga ac'in like a little girl 
 It's foul, he don't wanna blow trial, why not? 
 Cause up north niggas like him get smacked around 
 I never turn my back, on you faceless cowards 
 Talkin' all that shit, don't know a thing about us 
 I educate 'em with the pretty four pounder 
 But each and every day we get flagrant and more fouler 
 Keep it thorough, don't want that bullshit around us 
 Moved away from drama but some how it found us 
 It's a small thing, let that dro burn 
 Nigga front he gettin' touched that's my word 
 Niggas knows the deal we clap hammers and shit 
 Bitches love us but niggas can't stand the clique 
 And dyke women, these motherfuckers running off emotions 
 Burn something, I'm ves'd ready to hurt something 
 Niggas knows the deal we clap hammers and shit 
 Bitches love us but niggas can't stand the clique

 But when it's on, ain't a thing that can stop the pound 
 Tear a fella a ass, a new ass at that 
 Glad to clap, never that, we had to clap 
 Nigga do it to they self, when they force the hand 
 Make me blast, how you trynna play me man 
 Like niggaz over here, don't get down for theirs 
 I need some man time, who got the fuckin' jack in here 
 Where, ever I leave, my head's my home 
 And if possible, always take my gat where I roam 
 These slugs'll take the bass outta niggaz voice quick 
 But, once we gangsta, now moist the shit 
 Scramble, he hit, how you like the scenery bitch 
 Keep ya eyes on my hands, fuck who you seeing me with

 Keep doing that shit, they gots to go 
 Infamous Mobb gots to blow, pounds of dro' 
 Makin' all the shorties, gettin' down on the floor 
 From that Murda Muzik shit, that'll make ya flip 
 And dump a clip, in a nigga that be talkin' shit 
 We think sick, check the credits, we get busy 
 And grimey, and gritty, when we livin' in the city 
 It's haters, traders, fake ass playas 
 Come to QBC, and nobody could save ya

 Of course we keep it gangsta, straight gangsta 
 Niggaz know it, I don't have to prove it, or show it 
 The gun bark, and the bite is a mutha, a killa 
 A playa, lay it down, a four pounder 
 The calm downer, when niggaz act a little too active 
 Smack kids into next week, little bastards

 Bump that - niggaz try to stunt on my clique 
 Then when I get on that shit, I bring it to 'em 
 Where they pump at, 12-gauge Mausberg 
 No shell in the head 'fore you put in work 
 You gotta pump that - you done hit a nigga with it 
 And you runnin', the police is comin', take my advice nigga 
 Dump that - this is serious, these rap niggaz 
 I'm just havin' fun with it, 50 Cent, Havoc bump that 
 50 Cent: 
 My son asked, ""Daddy why you carry a gun, you ain't a cop"" 
 I looked at him and said, ""Sometimes you gotta shoot or get shot 
 Wanna go to show-and-tell and show the class my glock? 
 Show 'em the clip, show 'em the beam, show 'em how Daddy lean"" 
 In the convertible Jag, 22-inch mags 
 For a high school dropout, shit, that ain't bad 
 I'm ain't a Blood or a Crip, I'm doin' my own thang 
 G-UNIT! Shit, I done started my own gang 
 I don't go that funny dance, I don't throw gang signs 
 But I'm a gangsta to the core so I stay with a nine 
 You think all I do is rap, then you don't know me good 
 Have Smurf hangin' out the sunroof to light up yo' hood 
 Man, Carlito ain't never seen Blanco comin' 
 But if he did, you think he woulda started runnin'? 
 And I move with them Doublemint Twins, and two macs 
 I'll leave you flat your back - BRRRAT! Take that 
 Noyd: 
 Uh-huh, aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo 
 My life story is that gangsta thing, packin that thing 
 Iced out diamond rings; fuck linen 
 It's Timbs and jeans, puffin cigars, stuff it with greens 
 What's fuckin' with Queens? Nuttin and not a thing 
 We kings of rap, shanks and gats, knuckles and bats 
 Get at me, you want beef, come correct 
 Stunt on any nigga in my clique-ah, you get clapped 
 We sick, so quick, you be layin on your back 
 'Cause we don't give a fuck nigga, we love to dump 
 You don't wanna get jumped, better turn yo' music up 
 And bump that - 'cause we comin' with them guns black 
 And cause of the hoodrats, know where your home's at 
 Fuck that, this is for my niggaz in the hoods that 
 Slingin them blue caps, smokin' that chronic sack 
 Get that paper, watch for all haters 
 Snitches and them bitches and them inside traders 
 Nigga fuck that 
 Havoc: 
 Yeah, yeah 
 If you trippin' with my niggaz 50 and Noyd 
 If anybody ask me nigga them my homeboys 
 When it come to drama know we pack them big gats 
 (We got a ton of slugs) Bitch, and it's like that 
 We them thirsty ones, no mask, we stick cats 
 I never handcuff a ho, I let you whip that 
 Let my money bubble, live off the kick back 
 This midnight shit is serious, where your kids at? 
 These streets too dangerous to let them roam 
 I done seen the gulliest of 'em, cry for home 
 Like a fish out of water, they gasp and shake 
 I'm a friend of the jooks and the dukes and the duct tape 
 Like a Down South nigga I won't stop till I'm ""skraight"" 
 Walkin' up the street, testin out my heat 
 Uh-huh... and as you stand in disbelief 
 When it comes to the slugs I ain't cheap

 And all my thuns rhyme holding their dicks 
 With a nine on their side from hip to hip 
 You know the mobb niggas is sick and stay bent 
 Twist it get right, me and my guns is tight 
 And we both heated when the funds ain't right 
 Because we know someone getting stuck tonight 
 Before I crash I'm a fuck me some ass tonight 
 With a pocket full of dough 
 The bottle of the dro 
 With dreams of fucking some R&B hoe

 Bald heads and fades, du rags and waves 
 Can't forget about braids 
 Niggas don't rock like us 
 Ain't no hood like us 
 A yo I rep QB till I R.I.P 
 96 buildings 6 blocks in QB 
 Everyday is like a movie, so you know we had to pursuit it

 If I can't I get you I'm a bring it to your kids 
 Your moms, whatever it takes to strike back 
 I'll be waiting in your crib with the mack 
 Black gloves, no mask so you can see my face 
 And realize QB ain't playing no games

 And look out for my niggas up north doing bids

 I see you fagg*ts don't listen wanna bite my shit 
 You better walk with security my niggas dump clips 
 Catch you with your rap clique, and beat the shit out y'all 
 You could have a 30 deep entourage 
 You could have guns galore, shanks and more 
 We can bang to the EMS come and haul us off 
 I could give a fuck for what projects you ride for 
 We got dogs out there and we not scared

 Look at my life, you ain't ready to walk in my shoes 
 I was bruised in this game that's why I stay with them tools 
 Got nothing to lose, cause shit ain't workin' out for the kid 
 I had a deal over at Virgin, but they dropped the kid 
 How come, I don't know, they wasn't feelin' the kids 
 Or the music to hot for their ears to list' 
 Back to square one it's all good, it ain't gon' stop a nigga 
 Like have me do something stupid like go and pop a nigga 
 It's a movie and I'mma be the star of this shit 
 With ten bitches at one time, suckin' my dick 
 We gon' get rich and kill them two cats, that snitch 
 IM3, bustin' they way, through this hip hop shit 
 So watch your lip, don't say nothin' about my click 
 Or catch a clip, while you walkin' wit ya lady and shit 
 We crazy and shit, like chickens with their head cut off 
 We little niggaz with big guns that'll take your head off 
 And we rippin' your lady in the bathroom of the Green Acres Mall 
 Where gonna stand tall, we fall if a slug hit our chest 
 It's all gravy, Queensbridge roll like the Navy 
 Little girls runnin' around havin' mad babies

 So fast, you won't have time to build

 Ayo, we here foot in the door, time for take off 
 Yo, we take over, move over, IM3 
 And y'all niggaz don't really mean shit to me 
 Spread love through the five boroughs, tri-state mid-state 
 Violate, get your face carved in 
 Fuckin' with these Queensbridge marksmen 
 Never go against our grain, twenty tats, ball head cat, rep QB 
 See me on the stage iced out, laced up 
 Hazed up, jumping in them big ass trucks 
 When we shoot you better duck, you out of luck young'n 
 Catch you runnin' while we gunnin', chasin' you down like blood hounds 
 Beatin' you down, to the very last compound 
 With fo'four pounds, two aluminum bats, we ruin' you cats 
 We IM3 nigga you better move back, we fake no jacks 
 Jump real quick, we them Queens motherfuckers, that stay in that bullshit 
 (Godfather) 
 Looking back at time, a lot of niggaz died 
 Right before my eyes, suicide, homicide, do or die 
 My crew and I, pledge Infamous, don't leave no witnesses 
 We handled all our differences, these menaces we livin' it 
 We've been gettin' it got it, glock cock won't hesitate 
 To empty out the whole clip, y'all niggaz best notice 
 When it's time and it's bout to go down, we control the shit 
 Ain't nobody in this whole, industry can hold us in 
 You can try, but you won't succeed, we a rare breed 
 And don't say much, cause, real niggaz don't speak 
 Amongst beef, my handle like, hot sauce 
 I take that on top boards, my action unaccountable 
 Could snap at any give time, doubting you 
 My raps steady pounding you, we drowning you with Infamous 
 The IM3 continuous, we livin' it, I speak from experience 
 He's driven it, we M-O-B-B, QB, Murda Muzik

 Yo, that's that that shit, that I be, talkin' about 
 Niggaz, playin' they hands wrong, runnin' they mouth 
 Snitchin', all up in they blood, I can't click 
 There ain't nothing to discuss, I only fuck with 
 Niggaz raise with me, ain't no time for new friends 
 Loose ends, take my gangsta to the grave with me 
 It's all day with me, loyal to my dunns 
 Know it's nothing, cowards breathe when we clappin' those guns"

 For holding techs, mack nine, four pounds and shotties 
 You don't wanna get bodied so fix your face 
 Before I air that ass out, go to court and beat the case 
 It's real like that, I have no feelings inside 
 Maybe cause my twin brother died in front of my eyes 
 And it hurt till this day like a pain in my chest 
 That's why I stay vexed, in the hood sippin on Vex 
 Wishin I could get a check instead of robbin somethin' all the time 
 It's about crime, but we gotta give it up 
 Before they put me behind bars with no parole 
 I love old gold too much, I gotta stay on 
 Plus the orgies and shorties be blessin me all day 
 Even at a buffet they do what I say 
 We gon' start from the ground till we rise to the top 
 If not dunn, we gon' run up in these thangs with the glock

 You's a notebook crook, with loose sleave beef 
 A backseat criminal that pass the heat 
 To somebody that blast the heat 
 Man, it sound bad on the pad, what happened in the street? 
 Revealing on the vinyl an analog outlaw 
 Alot of gats on your DAT, tape southpaw 
 You thuggin' when the mic's plugged in 
 Barkin' through the speakers like you got no sense 
 You wild on the two inch 
 Got your platinum plaques to prove it 
 Your music's been around the World movin' 
 And it comes right back around on the ground, don't it? 
 Now it's time to face your opponent 
 Infamous cling to this real shit, stuck where we started at 
 Fuck that, not because we have to, I want to 
 I love this shit, the raw is what I live for 
 To hear the sound of the crowd roar for more 
 To see the niggas that can't pay rush the door 
 Whylin' on the dancefloor 
 When they song come on, swingin' they fists, ready for war 
 But it's a different type of effect, it's not violence 
 They're just tranced by the advance 
 Tranked by the sound bank 
 Put under the drum, numbed off of our shit 
 Now who you rockin' wit'? them or us 
 Deep love or cheap lust?, QB'll bust 
 Infamous till we pass on 
 You laughin' at the wrong shit, I take ac-tion 
 Defend my confedons 
 Nigga I write bombs that'll shatter your ambitions of bein' top dog 
 As we move through the stage fog 
 I need to bass more 
 So I can taste it and make y'all go AWOL 
 And lose it, say no more, brace your delf, nigga it's on... 
 Verse 2: (Cormega) 
 (Yo, back up yo..) 
 Who's tale you tellin' are you frail or felon? 
 Were you makin' sales or watchin' niggas sellin'? 
 You exploit niggas lives in your rhymes and then avoid 'em 
 You never felt the moisture in the air of coke boilin' 
 You never felt the razor scrapin' your plate 
 Your hands achin' yet you keep choppin' 'cause there's paper to make 
 You never felt the power of invincibility 
 Clutchin' a gun like fuck it dun, it's him or me 
 At your best you was a hand to hand 
 No more than Three grams 
 What the fuck you know about a Ki, man? 
 You never hustled 
 Let's get it right, my nigga Y would've stuck you 
 Stop dry snitchin' in your rhymes, listen 
 What you tryin' to do? help the guys in Blue? 
 Indight niggas so that can be another rhyme for you? 
 You a parasite, you never had a life 
 So you throw other niggas lives in your pad at night 
 It's clever when you write it 
 Spoken well for a dude who never been indighted 
 You know the deal mothafucka, the real make the fake niggas kneel 
 And lose appetites when you taste niggas steel 
 My rhymes are what it takes to get a deal and make it real 
 I'm like Big, you can't replace the skill 
 I laced it ill like Cocaine in Scarface's grill 
 Your mothafuckin' flow is basic, chill 
 I'm Cormega, raw forever 
 Y'all niggas know my steez, I'm reppin' for Queens 
 You minor league 
 I'm big time like Mark McGwire's team 
 Your whole team is pussy, when I squeeze vaginas bleed 
 My lyrics stay official 
 I bagged up coke on dishes made of crystal 
 Your niggas, they won't miss you 
 My Nickel-plated pistol - got Sixteen shots, you can take 'em wit' you 
 To the coffin or DA's office 
 Surgeory, nurses screamin' ""We lost him!"" 
 Life suddenly divorced him, fuck it, it cost him 
 If you want beef say no more 
 Brace your delf, nigga it's on, we spray Four-Fours, bitch!"

 Might as well be in jail or dead

 I made my bed and I'ma lay in it 
 But I ain't gonna stay in it 
 I might start sprayin shit 
 I should've stayed in school, but that's a dead issue 
 Fuck a G.E.D., that's like toilet tissue 
 All my friends are hoodlums and hustlers 
 Runnin' with a bunch of stupid crazy motherfuckers 
 Niggaz fuckin' their money up, niggaz gettin' knocked 
 And jealous motherfuckers, they want the whole block 
 Though I could start flippin gettin' on a mission 
 But I need much more, no time for bullshittin' 
 Niggaz listen... 
 (Chorus: Godfather Don - repeat 2X) 
 The H-E-A-T- makes me crazy 
 I wanna bust somethin', figures, touch somethin' 
 The heat is on, got a niggaz blood rushin' 
 I wanna touch somethin', niggaz bust somethin' 
 (Verse 2: Prodigy) 
 Yo, all I know is guns, all I do is slug 
 I'd rather plug you with the heater than to have you front 
 My life revolves around the snub 4th 
 Stay gettin' those outside of New York 
 Bullets from the cornerstore, I'm bringin' home a arsen 
 Interstate 95 North to the Jackie Robinson 
 Watch out for D's in caprices in tauruses 
 Empire mistakes for cops, mad nervous 
 Back at home sell a few burners 
 Keep a miz and a seven mil for my personal 
 Walk with benevolence, holdin' twin fifths 
 380's in the whip, a mini-eagle for my chick 
 That nigga P is sick, I need a silencer connect, see me 
 Niggaz be lyin', tellin' stories, tell it walkin' 
 My nigga's into drugs and extortion 
 Knotty head for them niggaz on the nightshift pumpin' 
 The heat is on nigga..."

 Yo, if you make a lotta cream and don't share them stacks 
 (Prodigy) 
 Yeah, it ain't where you from, it's where you at 
 I know a lotta niggas that'll tear your back 
 (Kool G Rap) 
 It ain't where you from, kid, it's where you at 
 (Prodigy) 
 Listen, if you goin' out of town and don't bear them gats 
 (Kool G Rap) 
 It ain't where you from, kid, it's where you at 
 If you caught up in a beef and you scared to clap 
 (Prodigy) 
 Dogs, it ain't where you from, it's where you at 
 (VERSE 1: Kool G Rap) 
 Shit, thug listen (What up baby?) 
 Ain't nothin' 'round here but drug addiction 
 Niggas is anti-love-livin' 
 The slug-givin' little shortie on the snub itchin 
 For beef, he might get left in the street with his blood drippin 
 The poor niggas sling crack, real raw niggas that bang gats 
 Crazy lady jumped on the train tracks 
 Know if you owe somebody dough you better bring that 
 Them kids is live, put five where your brain at 
 You walk the streets of the slums 
 Know to spot beef when it come 
 Reach for the guns or feel the heat from the ones 
 Never know who your killer be (Yeah, speak to no one) 
 Just put a Desert Eagle beak in his lung 
 Leak 'em and run, some guys light the blunts up 
 (And then what?) And then go ride with the pumps up 
 Chopped up bitch inside of a dumpster 
 Paramedics tryin' to speed a nigga pulse up 
 (Yo, he's a cold blue) victim of the vultures 
 Block sizzlin hot, flooded in the middle with cops 
 Innocent nigga topped, riddled with shots 
 Kids up in rock spots clock knots, fiddle with glocks 
 Ready to die for what little they got 
 Tricks, hoes and thugs (That's right) 
 The ones that put holes in mugs 
 Waitin outside for them ones that pose in clubs 
 To that strange nigga knockin' on your do' with gloves 
 Let the .44 blow for grub, it's no love 
 (VERSE 2: Prodigy) 
 You got uniformed cops, the D's when it's hot 
 TNT knockin' down the door of your spot 
 The feds come get you once you think you on top 
 They just been buildin they case, they got you on tape 
 The CIA clip you if the shit is that deep 
 Your money's that long, you ain't that strong 
 Informants'll bury you under the jail 
 They got wires and statements for juries to hear 
 Then they got rivals that got it clickin just like you 
 That's your competition, them niggas tryin' to eat too 
 They'll set you up for dead if you don't show strength 
 Extort all your workers cause you ain't built for this 
 Plus stick-up kids and jealous-ass niggas 
 You gotta watch your front, sides and your back (Damn) 
 You gotta keep your eyes on your bitch and your mens 
 You gotta keep your mind sharp livin' so fed"
116,Mobb Deep,hiphop,Thug Chronicles (Unreleased Version),"(Kool G Rap) 
 Queens shit, we bring the thug shit for real nigga 
 You know how we do, y'all know how a nigga bring it 
 Straight direct at you kid 
 (Verse 1: Kool G Rap) 
 Like a Don from out of Sicily 
 Under the arm is where the pistol be 
 Top of your forehead the kiss will be 
 Plant it ever so soft and gentle but die viciously 
 Hours of torture before the torture apply misery 
 Days before I feel pity to give a guy liberty 
 Seat of his pants shitty and eyes all glittery 
 I'll die a rich man before the F.B.I. figure me 
 40 storeys up inside a high-rise in Italy 
 No hittin' forces only natural courses could 'liver me 
 Gray hairs from the great years the fears never shiver me 
 Reminiscing how we car bombed ignitions 
 And Politicians, Judges strong-armed to listen 
 Men turning up dead or hurt, harmed and missing (forever) 
 Bulletproof cars are driven Teflon edition 
 Bodies cut up in large chunks thrown in car trunks 
 Music inside the bar stunk ... 
 Gettin' surrounded by bitches blowin' some cigars drunk 
 One of my stone face goons will make your heart pump 
 Electrocution with cables that make your car jump 
 The yard punks, the sin with the life sentence for sellin hard junk 
 The family, the whole commission 
 Has been around since the days before prohibition 
 Mathematics was good then, no slow addition 
 Some overdose down the coke slope and dope addiction 
 Lookin' back on them days I ran a whole division 
 Some of the jake in the State was tryna throw the mission 
 They caught a ticket ride to hell with no admission 
 Beyond these tracks ... 
 Our life and network of sippin' bourbon and Cognac 
 First version observing the stocks and bonds we stack 
 Thug chronicles these are the days of Don G Rap 
 (Havoc) 
 Wit' murder on his mind take it in blood 
 We takin' that aim at niggaz throwin' shit in the game 
 (Hook: Havoc) 
 Yo, how it feel when we coming at you 
 These gats blowing at you 
 Personally don't give a fuck where you at 
 And an unfamiliar face you know we like who that 
 On point nigga it ain't goin' down like that 
 (Verse 2: Kool G Rap) 
 We do our thing under handily still 
 Tuck a mil for the family will 
 Mansion and hot wheels in Amityville 
 Treat a snitch nigga like Sam when he squeel 
 Break the code of silence just hand me the steel 
 For every wrong done a man will be killed 
 There's plans to re-build ... 
 Curtains and drapes got the jakes tryna can me for real 
 Until then, be in the backyard with clam on the grill 
 Or catch me laid up in the canopy ill 
 With two mami's handing me thrills 
 Vivica Fox body vanity grills 
 Rubberbanding these bills 
 Tryna duck the fame of the glamor 
 Tryna stay from out the range of the scanners 
 Not tryna get my frame in a camera 
 Avoid tabloids and front pages 
 Bums get knocked off and bumped for favors 
 Collect Trump papers with pumps and gauges 
 Royale suites when I bunk in Vegas 
 Got homicide searching the city dumped for neighbors 
 Pinky ring with a chunk of glacier 
 Copped a spot with a bunch of acres 
 Some them got their bodies slumped from capers 
 Barcaleno hat, tux and gators 
 Got a crib full of house maids, butlers and waiters 
 My clique from the minor league, jump the majors 
 We gon' rock it till we jackpot fuck them haters 
 If we have to run up in City Hall abduct the Mayor 
 Any man against the master plan get bucked wit craters

 And once I settle down, pre-nup to the lucky broad 
 A Bentley Coupe, a bless in the backseat 
 First day, once they hand over them keys 
 Couple of G's, I'm trickin on the watermelon trees 
 So high, so stuck, like Jay's Rucker team 
 On the bus no diss f'real stuck 
 Just countin' that, money and still visit my niggaz on the Island 
 The money mountain I climb it, it won't stop 
 My money too dirty to ever go pop 
 It's a lot, you could do with a fifty {?} watch 
 Steadily, eliminate, competition and flood 
 That block with the primo, 'cause the trunkilo {?} 
 Not for too long, gotta stay on top of your people 
 (Chorus - repeat 2X)

 It don't matter if it's the winter or summertime 
 I got the mac in my pants 
 Make niggaz do that dance, they fuck with mines 
 It always come a time, when it's time to flip 
 You only flippin when you hit by a gun of mines 
 You broke and you wanna shine, you in a dollar van 
 I'm in a oh-five G-55 
 That girl you with's a friend of mine, I hope that's not yo' wife 
 You wouldn't do that if you seen the bitch other side 
 We ain't got time for peasants, the streets need our presence 
 They not gettin' fed from them other guys 
 We in the hood like drugs, if we ain't out on tour 
 With Mobb Deep written on the headline 
 While y'all poppin' all that lip 
 We does what y'all talk and more of that kid 
 Unfold one of my knots, it look like a brick 
 We'll never go broke, while you sit and bitch

 Attracted to the lifestyle of how us gangsters live

 And I'm so much rich, I got a condo for a piggy bank 
 So much stash, I just laugh at yo' face 
 Blow a stack on David, 'cause I'ma pyro

 Heavy bones on the deuce, flickin' it up in the mix 
 Fast forward to '06, gettin' head in the '06 
 Have a chick, feelin' like she workin' out on that Bow-Flex 
 I'm focused, looked through my lens, see my vision 
 Surprise myself and came through without one spool missin' 
 From that hallway kissin', there was room in the Carlton 
 I can smell it in the air, P in that next room sparkin' 
 Me, I let that heady flow, meet me at the tele' hoe

 This Hollywood shit'll catch you slippin' if you let it 
 So niggaz started grillin' me 
 Like they was gon' take my things, so I assumed I had to set it 
 Now it's blood splashed all on the ice in my jewellery

 Dead over a record, shit he sound like he meant it

 How he the streets, and I ain't put no work in

 You the nigga that was careless, get the fuck out of here 
 Yeah, blood, sweat, and tears, every buck I made 
 I ain't complain when you was hustlin' and I leave paid 
 Yeah I'm up, boilin' blood to see me bust 
 Even worse they ask for help, like I'm the Red Cross 
 I don't knock niggaz when they down, I try to lift 'em

 Can't happen overnight, when it comes to winnin' (Naw)

 While you still tryin' to overcome your childhood fears 
 We settin' up shop, takin' over the blocks 
 In e'ry hood, e'ry boy, and e'ry girl gon' cop

 On the kid; they all wanna touch 
 On a nigga skin, they love me so much 
 They all got P on they brain 
 And at the show they do anything to get backstage 
 Just so they can hug 50, and kiss on Banks 
 After we all get a turn, the broads said, ""Thanks."" 
 Shit, just last month a nigga wasn't shit 
 Now I finger pop dimes, with diamonds on my fists 
 Niggaz bringing me they girl like, ""You can have my bitch 
 Just help me get down with the G-unit!"" 
 Man, little groupies - they make me sick 
 You ain't getting in the after party unless you're a chick 
 And bitch, you ain't getting in the hotel - unless we grip 
 And you're gonna look fine, plus suck a mean dick (whoa)

 Harder than the politician on the campaigne 
 No games baby girl, gotta do the damn thing 
 Let me see you back it up till you pull a hamstring 
 Face fuck, girl go for broke 
 So hard, leave stretch marks up in her throat 
 Then Havoc on the floor 
 I don't need to get her number - she'll be at the next show 
 Half-ass dress, smelling like sex 
 Dried up nutt on her neck 
 They don't call us the master of the tour (?) for nothing 
 We destroy good girls; send them home with pussy soft from fucking 
 Catch 'em in the morning and somebody White-T'd 
 And that's the kind of bitch that you call wifey 
 She'll do it anywhere from the tele to the tour bus

 It's been along time comin' I done paid my dues 
 Now every time I turn around it's like I'm back in the news 
 I know alot of niggaz want me wearin cement shoes 
 And Uncle Tom niggaz wanna see me locked up to 
 Around the same time KRS was writin Black Cop 
 I was busy tryin' to pump cracks in the black blocks 
 Poppin' shit to my homeys about how my gat pop 
 Got rid of that chrome thing and got back a black glock 
 P ninety hold ten but I had six shots 
 I used to walk around with it and risk gettin' knocked 
 I bought a fresh box of bullets from Old Man Sam 
 Wanted to shoot a nigga so bad it was itchin my hand 
 Some shot it out with me, and some of them ran 
 And some of them dashed were good and some of them jammed

 Som I did so much dirt I'm tryin' to clean my slate 
 And ate so many niggaz food and now they want mines ate 
 The dogs bark when I walk and since the souls I took 
 Moms pray for me with her right hand on the good book 
 Saw shots fly by me no I shouldn't been trippin' 
 The Pulp Fiction must have been God's divine intervention 
 Wouldn't thought then from that, I learned my lesson 
 And clean my act up and go straight to perfection 
 Uncle La got knocked the feds hit it with seven 
 And left me with the fifty cal and a mac eleven 
 Start everything from everything from heads to the worries

 Found myself askin God what the fuck is my purpose

 For not showin me no signs they watchin over me 
 Yo! We a new breed in two thousand six 
 We don't give a fuck about that religious bullshit 
 Nigga show me where the cash at 
 The nice whips with the three car garage to fit them shits 
 Man my life is painful, pray to angels 
 I'm prayin' to myself hopin I ain't got to spank you

 Daydreamin' of dirt bikes, and four wheelers 
 Shoppin' sprees at the diamond dealer 
 Hats and jackets, shirts, pants and sneakers 
 That brand new car smell 
 We sceamin' daydreamin' of penthouses in L.A. 
 The illest yachts, the hottest broads they make 
 Can't wait till it's my turn to get dough 
 So I don't gotta fuckin' day dream no more 
 (Verse 1 - Prodigy) 
 Coming up we ain't have much, a lot of canned food 
 Cereal in the white box, with powdered milk too 
 My moms couldn't buy me the shoes I want 
 We put lay-away on shit that only cost a few bucks 
 Its cool to have shelto, I had the libeaz 
 With the weak ass velcro, looking ridiculous 
 I knew way back then we had to step it up 
 Cause waiting for the bus in the snow wasn't us 
 Me and hav' took the train from Manhattan to Coney 
 Everyday and night, just so we can got songs done 
 We had guns, weed, and a couple of forties 
 If we got lucky on the way, we could jook someone 
 We used to watch video music box 
 And pray maybe one day we could get a shot 
 Outside, my niggaz had all that shit you see on TV 
 From money that they made off the block 
 (Chorus - Prodigy) 
 Daydreamin' of dirt bikes, and four wheelers 
 Shoppin' sprees at the diamond dealer 
 Hats and jackets, shirts, pants and sneakers

 Can't wait till it's my turn to get dough 
 So I don't gotta fuckin' day dream no more 
 (Verse 2 - Havoc) 
 My day dreams, is more like nightmares 
 A vigi, bullet proof cars, supped up time shares 
 My friends did a turn 'cause it's not they turn 
 Or how the streets gonna be, when they release fur 
 When I get that million bucks, will I remain the same 
 Or will I have to get at niggaz 'cause they sayin' I changed 
 Will everybody wanna ball, be my friend and leech 
 When niggaz put me to the test, have me clapping the heat 
 I used to think bein' rich, ain't all that bad 
 A far cry from what a dream, was all I had 
 Do I got the right team, or they riding for cash 
 Would they jump in front of me, when them cameras flash 
 Is the 'pop police, gon' be up my ass 
 Can't leave the heat under the seat, gotta find a better stash 
 Gotta collect receipts cause that bitch uncle sam 
 Invades your space when you evade his tax 
 (Chorus - Prodigy) 
 Daydreamin' of dirt bikes, and four wheelers 
 Shoppin' sprees at the diamond dealer 
 Hats and jackets, shirts, pants and sneakers

 (Prodigy) 
 Just when you thought it was safe to come out 
 Infamous all in your face, in your mouth 
 That's right, niggaz best to stay up in the house 
 Watch we getting our money, for the two thou' 
 Nigga, P back out in the streets, so what now? 
 Strictly for the ghettos and hoods, in your town 
 Pableek (?) got bundles of drugs in your town 
 Like crack, coke and dope - remember me now? 
 Queen Bridge motherfucker we'll blow your house down 
 We the big bad wolf that'll eat your food clown 
 I ain't gotta huff and puff you know my style 
 Calm as fuck, I just let my gun wild out 
 I got cash motherfucker I could have you touched 
 But I rather be hands on with that son 
 Certain things, you just gotta perform yourself son 
 When I start busting I don't stop till I hitting, c'mon 
 (Hook: 50 Cent + (Prodigy)) 
 Everybody got gangs everybody got clicks 
 But they ain't like this (the Infamous) 
 Everybody can't afford to live the lifestyle 
 Of the young, black and rich (the Infamous) 
 You ain't crazy, don't make me show you 
 Why they call us this (the Infamous) 
 We own the streets - who basically control 
 This rap shit - G-g-g-g-g-g-g-unit! 
 (Havoc) 
 We got the most gangsta shit, the second most biggest projects 
 We sold the most crack, since '86 
 We don't handle a lot of pricks, we the most thug 
 You think you're dirty over there, but we're more dirtier 
 We last more longer than them; more songs than them 
 More money for us, more broads than them 
 We get the most love in the streets 
 I had the most tattoos, ever since thirteen 
 P got the most now; our guns are the most loud 
 With enough bullets to down mostly the whole crowd 
 We drink the most Henny, yeah me and Jake 
 We smoke the most weed, that's mostly the haze 
 Get the most (?) kicked on a nigga's face 
 Gotta be the most idiot nigga on the face 
 Of the Earth, to ever let the thought cross your head 
 That we're not the most likely to pop off kid 
 (Prodigy) 
 Right now, I change guns with the season 
 When I was young I bought Ninja Stars on Jamaica Ave 
 Hitting trees then; started hitting trees then 
 We ran the train on the girls and on my family dance schools 
 We was beasting, little young heaven 
 I had the rainbow knife, and when I got my first gun I was cheesing 
 I couldn't believe it; I had the power of life or death 
 In the palm of my hands, fiending 
 But quickly to be scheming; if you choose to front on me 
 That leaves me with no choice but to start squeezing 
 And I hope they stop breathing 
 Because if they do pull through, in the hospital beds 
 They'll be squealing - talking to these D's man 
 They don't waste no time, they want answers 
 Even if you're still bleeding 
 Homey I'm on the fleezy 
 I ain't got no time neither I'm making money off of this - it's too easy!"
145,Mobb Deep,hiphop,In Love With The Moulah,"(Havoc) 
 Yeah I want you baby, I'm glad you here 
 I'ma take good care of you, I'm gonna put you right there 
 I ain't letting' you go this time, nah you gonna stay right here 
 I'ma call you money baby, money 
 (Verse - Havoc) 
 It started bout 7 when I realized ya worth 
 Sold drugs to put you all alone with this purse 
 Took a backseat, cause family came first 
 Holes in my sneakers and shirt 
 I turned 13, now lil' niggaz sellin' coke 
 50 4 1l's yeah I copped 'em for them hoes 
 But you left without warning, I guess it was a lesson 
 I had you but you showed me no affection 
 Got withdrawals, took you to the malls 
 The more I got of you, the more I got spoiled 
 Now my toes curl, lets have a baby boy or girl 
 Had you in Switzerland, half across the world 
 Grew up an investment and you can't be doubled 
 Came back around when I bubbled 
 Now I'm in trouble, took the wrong turn 
 Let my homie borrow you, now he won't pick up his phone 
 Where you goin' baby where you goin' 
 Talk about money this is money baby where you goin' 
 I can hold you baby I can hold you let me hold you 
 (Chorus - Prodigy - 2X) 
 The thing about you is you make me smile 
 You build me up when I go down, you give me strength, you give me power 
 May no one come between this thing of ours 
 (Verse - Prodigy) 
 You give me sex, you give me gifts 
 You give me head from every baddest bitch 
 You make me happy you make me sick 
 Cause baby you my drug and I need my fix 
 If I ain't have you how would I live 
 To get you I'd risk that time in prison 
 To get you I'd take risks that'd mean death 
 I'ma love you until the end 
 It's all about you my precious, 
 I'd never ignore you for a bitch again 
 I'd put that on my honest, 
 Got these other nigga jealous cause you all over me 
 In public, you be all inside my jeans 
 Took me all over the planet, places like Europe 
 Taught me new tricks at them banks out in ?? 
 These niggaz, back in the hood 
 Could never have you like how I do 
 (Chorus - Prodigy - 2X) 
 The thing about you is you make me smile 
 You build me up when I go down, you give me strength, you give me power 
 May no one come between this thing of ours 
 I need you, I need you in my life 
 Stay right here with us 
 Ain't nothin' over there for you 
 Stay right here with us you in good hands right here"

 The trillion cuts, the Audi and Porsche trucks 
 I do these things for you 'cause you my dunn

 Nuttin but time with certain other broads I rip 
 You belong in minks, bracelets and rings 
 Not handcuffs forget about that locket chain 
 And just leave lil' mama, this P lil' mama

 Yo, yo... 
 When we first middle sex fif, knew that you was that chick 
 Wooly sayin' holla at her, whip sayin' girl get in 
 Remind me of a women that, I can have without the stress 
 Asked if she had a man, couldn't tell if no or yes 
 Hell, I jus dipped her number and talked more 
 When I hit you one conversation, I knew that she had trust issues 
 Who the hell would do that, man cheated on her twice 
 Last one before that, found out homie had a wife 
 Looked so secure, but yet so delicate 
 Can't come back in the crib without a search for evidence 
 Baby girl, I ain't here to hurt you, here to protect and serve you 
 Ain't your fool model them other dudes don't deserve you 
 What you tryin' to do, scare me off and leave you low 
 Funny how you let it ring and never answer your phone 
 The accuser got me curious, I asked who it was 
 He like the ""sold-a-soul"" man, who the fuck you 'cause? I'm out... 
 (Mary J. Blige) 
 Everytime I hurt you it's because of what someone else has done to me 
 And I know it's not really fair 
 Though I just can't trust you 'cause I just got outta something I'm not running 
 Boy you know that I'm running scared 
 You treat me so good that its just too good to be true 
 And I don't think that I really deserve 
 To be treated like a woman should 
 'Cause I been so hurtin' the past I'm still carryin' bags

 We can ball to the fullest baby... it's all right... it's all right... 
 You can style if you want, go ahead stunt... it's all right... it's all right...

 Got the hunger to go get it, 'cause I wan' go spend it 
 You know how a boss play a play, nigga I'm ballin' 
 If there's money to be made, I'm all in 
 Catch me in the cherry-red porsche, bay seats, red pipe, and 
 You want me to teach ya how to stunt, aite then

 No mercy, shit left me about 
 Years ago, I let him in, I'll see him out 
 And now he on the floor just bleeding out 
 You know it's on when you see me and my team out 
 We conquer, overpower and crush 
 Come and get washed up 
 E's back, easy man, move before we seep that 
 Lame ass team that you got off of the mat 
 Weak cat, pull it back, please do repeat that 
 Queens rep: we got more than a little of that 
 We used to daydream on the bench how we could cease this 
 And conquer like the British in snapbacks and fitteds 
 Getting soaked up, no love, the boy's back, he showed up 
 Soldier up, you know it up, come and get folded up 
 Your bitch is attracted to all of this madness 
 She want a felon, she ain't fuckin' with no graduates 
 Bad hood, bitch magnet, I'm a savage 
 They just wanna fuck, niggas wanna talk marriage 
 Baby carriage, sittin' in a tree 
 While I be pipin' 'em down inside of hoopties 
 Like, longer, harder, this Mobb shit stronger 
 Than all of y'all weak music, we conquer"
151,Mobb Deep,hiphop,Get It Forever,"Niggas know and if they don't 
 I shoot 'em in the head, whatever rock his fucking boat 
 Niggas in my face, you better leave before you can't 
 I lay shots like (?) 
 I'm hot check the critics, call the paramedics 
 Your man was talking reckless so you know he had to get it 
 Me and money's magnetic, and you the polar opposite 
 Come through, bitch start dropping it, getting low 
 I don't gotta trick, the only magic I know 
 Wore the number 32 and retired some time ago 
 So check the liner notes and miss me with the bullshit 
 Miss me with it or get hit with a full clip 
 I'm back on it, you can bet your ass on it 
 I'm so sure that I could put my fucking last on it 
 And if I didn't sell then you know I rapped on it 
 Beat so ugly, gotta put a fucking mask on it 
 We get it forever 
 It's on forever 
 Calm down, never 
 Slow it down, never 
 We get it forever 
 We do this forever 
 It's on forever 
 Calm down, never 
 Slow it down, never 
 Looking through my eyes' view I see nothing but 
 Success for us, non-stop nothing but 
 Long money, long jab I stretch 
 Wrap around the Earth, eighty times ten 
 Warm breezes and Barbado nights 
 Living sweet yeah but it's a cold life 
 You know we strapped in, best you buckle up 
 I did my little bid in (?) so what's up 
 Dare a nigga trouble us, make my niggas risk all of this 
 Infamous good shit, so quick 
 I'll be back inside the cage, my rage is unchanged 
 For this change, (?) 
 Change and pinky rings, estates for the kings 
 A Queens-bred gentlemen, she know how we bang 
 You tamper with this plush lifestyle, may you lay 
 In a hole till you ferment, your bones decay 
 We come from where murders occur often on late nights 
 Niggas is high and they eyes be red as two brake lights 
 Medical marijuana, Henny bottles, and Grey Goose 
 Semis and shottys on deck, everybody's face screwed 
 But you know this already, my hood the coldest and deadly 
 Soldiers is ready, I am boastful, forgive me 
 Bitches talking and cops cry when they nigga get washed 
 (?) If they squashed, go finish that shit that you start 
 No clip in your Glock, you ain't prepared to fire 
 We call that riding with no air in your tire 
 You're flattened, it's a pattern after scrapping 
 What usually happen, death on arrival 
 Survival of the fittest, ain't nothing like that Queensbridge shit 
 Y'all niggas finished, your only chances are diminished 
 And we don't need no fucking witness 
 Ain't what you know, it's what you live and we live it"

 We's about to go to war with these shotties and clips 
 Somebody's gonna get murked in the streets of New York 
 I keeps it thoro because I holds down the fort 
 My nigga Ski got it under control 
 And I will not stop what I'm doing till I get to old 
 Cause the streets needs me right now to make hits 
 And represent the hood I rep on my hits 
 On a song I talk about drugs and money 
 Selling coke and watcing crackheads live bummy."

 At the dice game, keep a mag on me 
 Why would I let another man ask bet me 
 I'm the best like Khaled, I bang if I should 
 A nigga gotta pay me if he throwin' ace in my hood 
 So the drug dealers wet work, beat all the pushers 
 When you was still in yo moms crib, eatin your boogers 
 I live the fast life, that's why I stay in a hurry 
 Papoose be killing the mic like Doctor Murray 
 King of New York, cop the caliber 
 My raps off the wall like a 2011 calendar 
 Why everybody out of character?

 The wrath of God will hit ya, with a horror picture 
 Call this rap takeout, you know Mobb deliver 
 Too hard for the hardest nigga, they fold like cardbord 
 Handle that now, nigga ain't no encores 
 ? A little heavy, so it leave the arm sore 
 Y'all want war, gave you what you starve for 
 All my shooters buy products of the worst recession 
 Aim for the dome and laugh when they purchase vests' 
 Cause that shit right there, is irrelevant 
 Niggas walk around here, with shit to kill a elephant 
 So your next move better be your best move 
 Like a chess move or get yo chest moved 
 'Cause when we come through you better have ya guns too 
 Cause all we do is *aim shoot* all we do is *aim shoot*

 Back from hell, sorry I left you without no hard shit to step to 
 The drought is done, it's rain season 
 You can't stop my storm, you can't slow up my flow up nah (uh uh) 
 It's gonna pour cats and dogs 
 Thunder and lightning bolts, knock the lights off 
 When I black out make you miss me like 
 Nigga, where you been at? Word 
 Bout tired of the soft shit, it gets boring 
 They look like punks and act like a woman 
 You need danger, a little aggression 
 You need excitement I put a little pressure 
 Just to, balance things out, we're not the same 
 Some niggas is live, some niggas is lame 
 Some is real or some is fake 
 You draw the line in the sand, which side you claim?

 Never rust big till bust you could touch 
 Blessed wit the real side of life

 You couldn't fight me wit your strongest mic 
 Layed down niggas eyes visualize bad reception 
 Maced your interference souped your upperbody section 
 I travel like a 2-2 bullet 
 Throughout your body, repped to the fullest

 Representin the hollow tip crew

 Once the kite is sent 
 I might get bent, but still planted 
 No second thoughts, 'cause my conscience is demandin 
 For the bloodshed (bloodshed) I leave that mug red (mug red) 
 I'm like cancer can't catch me 'cause I done spread (done spread)

 For tryin' to slow down, my cash pile a hundred mile 
 I can recall the days, juvenile crime pays 
 14 years old, shorty from round way 
 Brick ass cold, still puffin night to day 
 But why did my life have to be this way 
 I rock Velour suits, flavors like mixed fruits 
 My loot give recoup razors in my suit 
 Incase you try to troop me to the island 
 I known for start whylin 
 Back in New York, my shortie's got the cash pilin 
 Peep this on some knowns and teef shit 
 So much drama, who the fuck knows who we got beef wit

 Yo, my life story - based on a true story 
 We popped MAC's all growin' up, while y'all played story 
 We were playin' hide the cracks, while y'all played tag 
 I was a young gun learin' how to fight back 
 A 'lil rock head fuck, who neva learned shit 
 Who picked up a habit for the block life kid 
 A few cases, sit on the bench, make conversation 
 Yo, there's party tonight, get the razors 
 ""Dawg, but it's all goin' overboard"" 
 I told 'em - ""Dang god you tryin' to take a nigga arm"" 
 We're like a brick, when we come smashin' through 
 A-C-D, M-O-B, nigga fuck it's you 
 We're straight thugs over here bo', what the deal y'all? 
 Up in the staircase, post-up, long chrome 
 With the .4 long, closest I could reach my arm 
 Who wanna play target, check out the name of the song 
 It goes...

 Comin' up, I was a fuck up, burnin' blunts up 
 Playin' dice with the older crowd, puttin' dubs up 
 Some kids was into sports, I was into doe 
 You was mad 'cause you felt all I was stress 
 'Cause the money was slow 
 Fractured my hand, I'm stashin' 'em 
 Before I'm bagged wit 'em, plus my son got the Magnum 
 Wyldin' out in these young gun days, young love days 
 New to the game, but was curious about the fees 
 And them thick rope chains, I'm stuck on how 
 Niggaz blew up off cocaine, and opened wide 
 In '88, when I first heard Jane, we got all the - 
 But the hood still remains the same 
 Old fiends, same drugs, new thugs 
 Same slugs, new crews with MAC's 
 With thoughts to push it back, straight like that 
 Actin' up off Cognac, come through 
 Act hostile, but lay you flat, in the -

 Get bent; see that was my favorite hobby 
 Watchin' my dawgs get off, some even framed Ferrari's

 Young thugs we grew, still we're crashin' parties 
 Too all the shooks ones too, my crew'll bash and body 
 Dukes stuntin' witchu, don't make us clap somebody 
 New rats and other run fast and tellin' friends who looked fat 
 We off the hook as the jook style 
 Years went by pages turned onto calendar 
 Trade in my Tray .8, copped the .40 Caliber 
 Kept it on me in school, got shorty cuttin' out Algebra 
 Niggaz always seemed cool, others tryna to challenge us 
 Retaliation, got me trapped with false accusation 
 Tossed cracks and graders, when the ambs' invaded, madd congregation 
 Watchin' altercation go down, the rough frantic, when the hear the .4 pound

 I'm tellin' you right now 
 I know this shit though, aiyyo 
 Disagreeable, foul energy, tryin' to 
 Absorb my energy, knowin' it's the strength of me 
 Take a few to give me a edge 
 My green light shine bright, kryptonite type 
 Fully operational, my physical cream 
 Put the bottles of smoke down, pick up a magazine 
 Popped it inside the ar-15 
 Put it aside, round up the regime 
 While you rely on religion, I hold a nine 
 On the mission, to pull fire on your opposition 
 Revelation was the vision of this 
 Crack the heavens, it's time to bring the business, shit 
 My story goes back to them lost pyramids 
 I'm seeing things that you won't believe exists

 But are you really prepared, for the things to come?

 True underground sound from the boogie down 
 Uptown downtown gather round for the showdown, in they faces 
 Calling out these racists, at rolling stone 
 Spin details and other places, krs is the source 
 Fuck these magazine leadin hip-hop off course 
 You'll print about black mayors, black senators 
 Why you ain't got no black editors? 
 Everytime I do an interview in rolling stone 
 They sendin me a writer that look like he's home alone 
 Ignorant, to the culture and the microphone 
 This has got to stop -- your whole spot 
 Is blown sky high, battle why try? 
 My view is bird's eye, scopin with my third eye 
 You don't understand, why you're publicly banned 
 Until you recognize the writing skills of a black man 
 Black editor, all of us ain't thuggin' 
 Gossiping over who's homosexual 
 Some of us are black intellectuals, up in harlem world 
 You can't get with me, so now in midtown 
 You wanna stop and talk to me? 
 Bitch ass journalist, is this your fake hip-hop publication? 
 Look I'm burnin this

 How many didn't want to see it happen 
 Street moves, live from staten, if life is a joke, nobody laughin' 
 Hate to see a brother do good through legal action 
 So you sabotage and throw a def in the squad 
 Fo'-fo's blastin, keep the po-po flashin 
 These dark soul assassins, jake's hate the gods with a passion 
 So I keep it movin in an orderly, fashion 
 Pedal to the floor -- peep the jim crow law, mind control theory 
 Y'all niggaz don't hear me, generation next 
 Droppin' fast who's next, next to get wet 
 By the reign of the tech-knowledgy, follow me 
 Open up wide now, swallow me, every calorie 
 Is reality the truth, the whole truth and 
 Nothin' but the truth, taste is the proof 
 These niggaz want the juice, and in the crossfire 
 Be the youth, who didn't learn to duck when they shoot 
 (Kam) 
 What kind of party is this, it's that political kind 
 Where America's best, most hypocritical minds 
 Try they hands at keepin' y'all deaf dumb and blind 
 And for the right dollar sign, do white collar crime 
 Behind suits, and clean shaves 
 I confuse 'em and use 'em as tools and slaves 
 Because my schools is graves and jobs is plantations -- 
 I robs the damn nation 
 So I can live in luxury, you fucks with me 
 You marryin the dirt and I'ma throw in the tux for free 
 I tell the people what they wanna hear 
 I make 'em laugh and cheer, and then they re-elect me every year 
 So when the coast is clear, I stop duckin 
 And start back doin' dope, cussin and fuckin' 
 I kiss the babies, shake hands, wave and smile for flicks 
 That's my style, my pol-i-tricks 
 Triple-six convicts, lyin' is automatic

 One in the mug, leave 'em in the morgue, keepin' it gangsta? we keepin' 
 It thug 
 Makin' albums, washin' that dough made from narcotics 
 You know the mob brolic, gats we got it 
 Like a bitch on her period, don't even wanna see you 
 Unless you got what I need, and we sure not peoples 
 Only niggas that I fuck wit' could hold what I bust wit' 
 A one minute nigga, hit 'em like when I nut quick 
 Got a bad ass bitch that'll fuck your clique 
 Ass so fat, make the illest nigga dry snitch 
 It's time to stretch on these cats 'cause my dogs is restless 
 The number one sinner mothafucka, repent this. 
 Fuckin' wit' us will leave you in a cardboard box 
 Fuckin' wit' us will leave you leakin', callin' the cops 
 With nothin' to bust? we'll leave you in a fucked up spot 
 And you don't even wanna be that nigga claimin' a spot.

 Verse 2: (The Jackal) 
 Play stupid, 32 shots nigga, looped it 
 64 troopers, Tim boots and Rugers 
 Show and prover, Q.B. manuever 
 Pure breed grower, flow gives brain tumors 
 Holla at ya dog, movin' units 
 Ain't ready for the onslaught 
 Try to knock the Don off 
 Not too much talk, niggas just pop off 
 Got that feelin' inside, who willin' to ride? 
 Aight here, take this Four-Five 
 Cardboard box these niggas off sides 
 Rap nigga live, rap niggas alive 
 That nigga high, gangsta stroll, stackin' to the sky 
 Poppin' his collar nigga, tossin' that dollar 
 Act up, blood clot his throat, make it hard to swallow 
 Used to pitch times holdin' trotters 
 Now I pitch 16's with the culture power saga 
 You sorry, don't bother, Q.B. to Carter 
 Rucker, Nino, Goodfella, Godfather. 
 Verse 3: (Littles) 
 Came home after 5, stood on my own two 
 I learned to separate Men from Boys and crews 
 I toy with dudes, now I'm just annoyed with fools 
 I'm a pimp on a track with another Man's food 
 I refuse to be whored by another Man's rules 
 It's a pimp and ho game, you gotta respect the business 
 But I only mob with thugs and gangsta niggas 
 It seems nowadays snitches get respect 
 Y'all don't know a real nigga till he's laid to rest? 
 Y'all lucky I ain't come home chasin' necks 
 Arms, legs, chests, blazin' tecks 
 'Cause I love to snap, crackle, and pop them hammers 
 Rock bandanas, cop wanna knock and jam us 
 Watch and slam us, locked up, box and canners 
 'Cause when I start lickin' all you niggas start snitchin' 
 Bitchin', little niggas start missin' 
 We provide y'all with the truth and facts 
 Y'all don't wanna give me burn with these ruthless raps 
 Shit, I'll bounce y'all ass straight off the tracks 
 Plus I roll with gorillas and I'm true to cats. 
 Verse 4: (Nature) 
 All I need is a kick and a snare, y'all niggas scared 
 My name speaks for itself, it rains as soon as it hits the air 
 Got a wicked stare, one eye crossed 
 In Queens fiends returnin' every gun I toss 
 Every dun I corpse, my religion is none 
 I figured once I lay it out niggas'll run 
 I could type it up e-mail 
 And give it to you, when you're done you're comin' back for a refill 
 Grade A shit, like the taste of the haze and the dro 
 I rock the same Guess jeans five days in a row 
 See my Thirty-Six waist is now Thirty-Eight 
 Quick to help a nigga up to the pearly gates 
 Makin' sure every other live nigga heard of Nate 
 Guaranteed to boost the murder rate 
 If it don't it will niggas, chill just give it some time 
 How much pain can a nigga provide? 
 Y'all niggas rhyme?"

 Stop all of the gossip, baby don't you got better things 
 Fuck a new friend, they just potential enemies

 With my bullets pine your head 
 The only one you know, squeezin' folks 
 And connect, to whoever I was squeezin' for 
 I get searched and let 'em feel my gun 
 They know P not shootin' unless you force him 
 And they know Hav' won't get you, unless you make that nigga 
 And we off in the club, doin' what we does 
 So while you runnin' your mouth about us 
 Me and Hav' in the hotel, tradin' sluts (Aiyo get'out)

 Call all your goons, from when you was locked up 
 Put us all in one room, and we can lock up 
 This is Infamous to the death son

 Yeah, yeah, yeah

 Yo dunn, they wish they can have talent like this

 Call his bluff if he think he tough enough to walk my streets 
 Or shoot a fair one at 'em one time 
 Grab his night stick and beat his ass down till he's flat line

 Hip hop was set out in the dark 
 The Bridge was never Over, we left our mark 
 The jam is dedicated to you and your boys 
 I brought my Queensbridge thugs to kill that noise

 I saw these fools tryin' to get around, tryin' to let me down 
 And all dat, ha but I got an easier way to let dem drown 
 Wit these guns of navarrone, I shall shoot dem like al capone 
 Take dem to the zones of bones, like dat well 
 *Begins chanting and rhyming* 
 (Prodigy) 
 Yo dunn, they tried to knock me down, bury me under 
 Big pipes soundin like thunder 
 Skated by the skin of my teeth, I had to put a man in his place last week 
 Now why you wanna come at me? 
 I'm the wrong nigga to approach like that, homes 
 Wrong nigga for threats, lone nigga wit long chrome 
 And we can dance till one of us drop 
 You score points fallin' wit good formation 
 I'm the wrong nigga for patience, wrong one at dunn 
 The very last nigga you should ever blast your gun 
 To the floor, actin' like you goin' to war 
 Now you fucked up, here come a real rocket launcher 
 Flame thrower, rule wit a iron rod 
 That be the ruger, y'all niggas keep tryin' hard 
 But who the loser when you can't walk your hood at night 
 And you can't come outside without fear 
 Am I in your thoughts often? while you be walkin'? 
 Foot soldier catch you at the store's corner 
 Keep me on your mind and don't slumber 
 Man the minute you slip wit those, that's your ass 
 *Bounty killer rhymes and chants*

 Squeeze off, let 'em know how real this is 
 M-o-b-b, d-double-e-p wit bounty killer 
 No other gun runners keep a round like this 
 >From q-u-double-e-n-s, my bomb borough, till the day of my death 
 Whether in shit I been in, runnin' down the block 
 Sprayin shots wit the lindon, listen 
 We all been through ac-tion, you know the last me blastin 
 The last man standin, pack shit long than bare wake 
 Neither the jake nor the snakes gon' stop it 
 You know the mobb lettin off rockets 
 Gun burners spit like lungies, dummies 
 Still nuttin pop but the shells, these ain't words from hell 
 These are slugs, something you feel 
 A gun runner nigga for real nigga 
 (Havoc) 
 Yo hear my gat blow, make you spit out crack 
 The actual, that brand new six that you couldn't seem to whip 
 Empty the clip, make sure no friendly get hit 
 While you layin bloodied up in the six 
 Flee the frontline, dismantle gap and bounce 
 Then watch the twelve o'clock news and hear them shout you out 
 Plug leak, slip rug right from under your feet 
 You runnin' the streets, you don't want no problems wit us 
 Everyday is like fourth of July to us 
 Henny in my cup beside the gat you'll find in my clutch 
 Interfere wit the plan and you will get touched 
 Let the liquor talk for you and you will get touched 
 Full fledge, like ra let 'em know the ledge 
 While you slippin off edge, your shorty's givin' me head 
 Cockin 'em legs like guns when I'm cockin to spray 
 Poppin' your way, sendin shit that's hot your way

 Die 'fore I let a n-gga play me, like I'm baby shit

 Most Infamous outta NY, jealous of my shine, the truth is in your eyes 
 You wanna be down, I might allow you to work for me 
 The keywords: ""work for me"", I put your ass in surgery 
 Ever step outta line, forget who boat you ride 
 Forget who train you ride 
 Forget who flag you fly 
 Read the name on it, Mobb deep 
 P and Hav' run this, employees get fire with some gun fire if it call for it 
 A thousand n-ggas couldn't stop me once I get to going 
 You can have a nation of millions, still wouldn't hold me back 
 Still wouldn't be lethal as Bun B the Mac

 No intervention could get them off the OD 
 Grand goon, all my fans, you seen loyal 
 Dedicated in the cut, wait weeks for you 
 And when they finally discover you 
 They gon need a dental record, you've been dead a month or two 
 Post mortem, shirvelled up, how dare us 
 We penalise traitors and only hail trust 
 Inhale piff and guzzle white liquor

 I can see the tears in ya eye, you ain't see nothing till you seen a grown man cry 
 (Verse 3 - Nas) 
 Yo, every gang, every hood's in my veins 
 It's my thing, it's real, I'm in tune 
 I chill like the cold side of the moon 
 Silence you dudes like an empty room 
 Empty out with silencers 
 You get murdered like how it was in a saloon 
 Anastasia that is 
 Haters can't live, talkin' about they putting 8 in my wig 
 I got my dollars up, try ya luck, you die, no trial for us 
 Court appointed lawyers as foul as f-ck and I'm too fly 
 'Cause when you're locked in prison, you're clock stop ticking 
 Now, you came home, the same age you went in 
 Mentality wise, get iller when boxed in 
 Fresh home, and right up top, you get it poppin'

 Especially against you 
 How soon we forget niggas minds be getting absent 
 Not gone for a minute

 And pull your faggot ass click out the darkness 
 Yo its QB, queer bastard we queens best 
 A quiet bullet will do yo ass justice 
 Why you stupid fuck look at you now 
 I can't believe how these niggas now-a-days gets down

 Leave you shot for dead, nigga I'll rot your flesh 
 By myself come for delf and just pop your head 
 Now have a good night you snake skin bastard 
 See you at the crossroads faggot 
 And in the mean time and in between time 
 Pee will be laid up with more shines, more dollars for more nines 
 More boxes of talons to put in your spine 
 You cross me nigga you lost your mind 
 Scratch that you never knew from the start 
 So I forgive you, after you die squirmish, shots burneth 
 (Prodigy Hook:) 
 Thun the get back, is so sweet 
 The taste of revenge your blood on the street 
 It's called payback for that shit you pulled 
 I don't respect your gangsta my guns explode 
 Thun the get back (yeah), is so sweet 
 The taste of revenge your blood on the street 
 It's called payback for that shit you did 
 Two wrongs don't make it right, it make it even BITCH 
 (Ammo Verse) 
 Son we chose life fast, and niggaz kept stuntin' 
 Had to show our ass straight up explode right fast 
 It sounds cold but we roll like that 
 Rippin' rats finished off our path, we was close like that 
 All them nights that we threw back yak 
 Who would thought he do me like that straight leave me flat 
 Niggaz ain't never feed me black, wanna see me clap 
 Blood filling up the cement crack 
 Straight snakes and I resent that I fall back try to prevent that 
 Try not to be bent at, foul atmosphere 
 Stunning what's happening here 
 Got me 'bout to dumb out dumping out Macs in here 
 Niggaz catch a hot one, fucking with Am this year 
 Wet every man in here vengeance lost my senses 
 Y'all start quarrels I end it 
 And show up at your wake full of sorrow pretending 
 To blend in

 Thun the get back, is so sweet 
 The taste of revenge your blood on the street 
 It's called payback for that shit you pulled

 (Tragedy Khadafi Verse) 
 Yo I blow holes in ?moschinos?, splash niggaz in they mink ?stoles? 
 Down to their Kenneth Coles, fuck model bitches center fold 
 Never love a hoe, you got guns let it go my nigga let it blow 
 And what had killed you is what you don't know 
 It's two-five goodfellas gettin' dough 
 Yo my mom chose dope made love to the needle 
 I caught 'em fuckin' numerous times and turned evil 
 Back in '89 you can say I'm trapped in tme 
 Still thirsty like a little nigga dying to sihne 
 Baby moms said I got issues, too many problems 
 I rock timbs till my socks turn orange 
 Do a nigga dirty, relate to the unworthy 
 A young G with Q-T and black shirty 
 I've been nice since lee pin stripes and britsh knights 
 Fore' building razor tag and sword fights 
 Niggaz see the light when they start losing pints 
 You can die by the gun or the knife 
 And I'm nice with both, coming at me with the wrong approach 
 Don't make me Arab neck tie your throat, you bitch nigga! 
 (Prodigy Hook: To Fade) 
 Thun the get back, is so sweet 
 The taste of revenge your blood on the street 
 It's called payback for that shit you pulled 
 I don't respect your gangsta my guns explode 
 Thun the get back (yeah), is so sweet 
 The taste of revenge your blood on the street 
 It's called payback for that shit you did 
 Two wrongs don't make it right, it make it even BITCH"

 Like I ain't homicide all over the beat 
 Like I ain't for the beef like I don't really care 
 'Cause I ain't camera shy we can do it any where 
 There's diamonds in my chain there's diamonds in my ear 
 A nigga come slippin' ill make him disappear 
 Ay nigga fuck all the slick talk get bread instead 
 Stay low strapped up metal on inf red 
 Too smooth won't slip new jewels don't trip 
 Been around the world twice jet, lear, boat, whip 
 Oh shit, I'm hella rowdy and I'm nothin' nice 
 Money ain't shit but a number name ya fuckin' price 
 Dick rider, coat taylor, ass kisser 
 Sucker for love, time to pick up the glass slipper 
 Look around ass nigga before you add liquer 
 Cause bein' an add libber he'll be ina bag with ya 
 I'm seein' a bad picture of bein' a cab skipper 
 Broke as fuck waitin' for Satan to come and get ya 
 Keep ya clique tight know ya goals 
 Don't speed slow ya role don't speak learn the code 
 For they pop ya ass barbecue ya body 
 With beans outta the shotty while I'm in the Maserati 
 With somethin' that's gonna swallow me 
 My trigga finger feenin' that nigga p a demon 
 Nigga my fangs start showin' if I'm seein' you dreamin' 
 Get to close and I'm bustin' it won't be no discussion 
 I'm a boss I don't speak I just nod my head 
 And you turn up missin' with ya own page in the feds 
 I got power and I will flex on you real quick 
 Call ya dawgs call ya trick hug ya moms for you split 
 'Cause you ain't never gone see that bitch again 
 And this ain't a war nigga we just havin' fun with ya 
 Like a bed with a baby if I smack ya I might kill ya 
 Half a million in diamonds half a billion from rhymin' 
 N I'm steady climbin' that means I'm still blowin' up 
 Got you burned while you lookin' see my Ferrari in Brooklyn 
 On the corner of murda and duke so come through 
 Ill light ya buildin' on fire that's why these rappers retire 
 'Cause they tired of dealin' with niggas like me 
 Now enough with all the lame shit and wrestlin' games kid 
 I need the rocks to fill the rest of the chain with 
 I need the block to feel the best that I came with 
 I need the cops to get the fuck off of my dick 
 Different day same shit media and paparazzi love 
 Envy and betrayal my hearts as cold as hockey gloves 
 I light up and take off that beef and broccoli high 
 Chocolate tie, green skunk, south Jamaica queens punk 
 Stand up ya boys back put ya grams up 
 Get money you ain't heard nothin' but a hit from me 
 Quit dummy 'cause it's a changin' of the guards 
 Beat bitches over the head the caveman of the squad 
 And he barely fell victim 'cause they raised him up so hard 
 So my 9 is on my hip and my praise is up to god 
 'Cause we in a battle field where the razors lead to scars 
 And the lazers lead to holes, slugs in 'n' out ya clothes 
 (Yeah) Hey Yo p, fuck these niggas man 
 Ill buck these niggas man, can't nobody else get no money

 I ain't tryin' to get hooked like phonics 
 We on the low, so, you won't be spotted 
 Front window tinted, so, you safe in the cockpit 
 Fools wild in the club, I just play the wall 
 My niggaz pray and pray for my downfall 
 Man, how I scoop them broads and get that groupie love 
 One look and your chick is dug 
 Y'all ain't real, y'all some home thugs 
 Please don't make me show you what I snuck in the club, yeah

 Fuck with the gifted, take a look at what my machines did 
 That I got from my niggaz from Queensbridge, you ain't seen shit 
 Take a shot of my liquor, then I pull on the trigger 
 Rollin' in with the Mobb Deep, and we steady gettin' thicker and thicker 
 For the lords and the gangsters, thugs and the killers 
 We got too many toolies floatin' between us, you can't get wit us 
 It's that killer Twista in the house and I'm 
 Quick to put the pistol in your mouth and uh 
 Got pounds like got seventy-five to cop twenty 
 But I'm only spendin' sixty, the rest is new glock money 
 Distribute 'em to the click that we steppin' up in the club 
 Where the freaks pop that ass on the dick, showin' us love

 You see us gettin' dressed up, ain't nuttin' 
 But some fresh white on whites and that ol' folks 
 Infamous a new label 
 Don't confuse our shit with no other labels 
 Come through that bitch just force and lay shit down 
 We don't gotta send people, we bang for real 
 You won't know if I did sum'n, I won't tell 
 Or rap about it songs 'cause that's goin' to jail

180,Mobb Deep,hiphop,Gusto,"Yeah A we gone do this up son 
 Yo we from Hempstead as close to the shacks as Parkside 
 My whole team is out for the gusto 
 Internally blood drip through ya body slow 
 We on the go but yo time is still limited 
 Unlimited type style and we be rippin shit 
 My whole team is out for the gusto 
 Internally blood drip through ya body slow 
 We on the go but yo time is still limited 
 Unlimited type style 
 Welcome to the PSG I represent 
 The littlest in the crew but first one to get up in em 
 I straight up skin 'em like wolves 
 I wish you would have been 
 Fakin' jack and get ya whole hood hit 
 But it's all good 
 We do the things y'all wish y'all could 
 And play the bat yo and watch the brothas bark like wood 
 So knock on it 
 Go head you want it 
 Nobody want it 
 You turned in for it pulled nine stingers like a brown hornet 
 While y'all was droppin' I was underground shadow boxin' 
 Layin' low puttin' final touches on the flow 
 So here we go, tryin' to snatch that dough 
 Got niggas breakin' camp like Dre from Death Row 
 From the streets to the jail, I represent well 
 Touch a nigga like brail, jacks are hotter than the third rail 
 Scale to tip in my favor, the livest save 
 Grade up in the U.S. now let's get this paper 
 I'm yawnin' while I wake up to the early morning gun-fire 
 Another day another scar to acquire 
 Jumped out my bed tried to break my alarm 
 Took a shower and then I strapped on my firearm 
 Grab my Pelle Pelle 'cause I want to look fly when I die 
 But it ain't my turn to say goodbye 
 How do I know? Some people call it instincts 
 I like to call it my luck who gives a fuck 
 I'm stuck, in this environment can't depart from it 
 And if I try I always end up back where I started 
 Plan A square one there's no escapin' 
 So I pun and realize my too 
 I'm tryin' to live a full life before my time is through 
 Clock's tickin', so I don't got no time for you 
 As I head outside amongst the rest of the animals 
 Where I feel relaxed and safe and I can stand it 
 (To all my kiko's) 
 It's sort of like a family brawl 
 We gather up all the soldiers and form into a invincible 
 Swarm of kids, now it's on again 
 Drinkin' straight from the bottle warm gin drippin' down my chin 
 For the crippled children you can't win 
 Against 25 niggas bent up with mac-10's 
 Semi-automatic, fully addicted crime addict 
 So long as there's cash involved I gotta have it 
 There's many different levels of the criminal mind 
 Either you're in it for the gusto or I'm wastin' your time 
 Now is you ready for men, 'cause they your peeps that you saw 
 You probably heard about me and my crew doin' what we do 
 For my nigga True and Smif-n-Wessun 
 'Cause I be wreckin' mic-checkin' fools that come around second-guessin' 
 I sparks in the dark like stars in the sky 
 Spiritually, lyrically, since knee-high 
 The cradle, I represent my peoples and my label 
 'Cause when you take a ride through Parkside it's fatal 
 What's my time to shine my design you can't define 
 It only takes a line and a rhyme to blow that mind 
 To have you buggin', niggas got they tapes dubbin 
 Where ain't no line for me to kick a rhyme pushin' and shovin' 
 Now it's over, walkin' like a soldier I told ya 
 Shorty droppin' bombs and shit, like Oklahoma 
 Kinda soul, comin' wit that bomb for sure 
 Run for shelter little brotha when it rain it pour 
 First of all the foundation 
 Money is the root of all evil 
 The cream'll have you shittin' on your people 
 Livin' like lotto, everything is everything 
 Ain't nothing change but the clothes that my money bring 
 I'm makin' figures that I never thought possible 
 You try to slow me down you'll find yourself in the hospital 
 My crew got the army in techses 
 And them Acuras that made you get your cap peeled backwards 
 For years, I've been tryin' to blow for years 
 Gettin' bent off Moet spend a G on beers 
 Livin' life to the fullest, my story ends wit a bullet 
 To the chrome-oil drop to the bottom of the pot 
 My invincible crew will never stop 
 If you're lookin', you can find me risin' to the top 
 I'm a classic approach my level and get your ass kicked 
 Floatin' in a river wit yo body rapped in plastic 
 I'm tryin' to make a half a million triple in size 
 Before my eyes, another part of my team dies 
 I can still hear his voice while he up in the sky 
 While the rest still livin' steady tellin' me lies 
 It's like a bad dream, and I can't wake up 
 But at the same time I love it and I can't give it up"

 Sometimes it feels like the whole world is against me 
 And is it the Henny that bend me; I be in the zone 
 Gazing at the walls, suppressed, thinking da phone 
 Don't take personal, but only a minor few can understand 
 What a nigga feeling; 40-first till I die motherfucka..(No doubt) 
 I'm still breathing. You a must son, we full bread 
 You ain't my dogg, tring to infiltrate my clik is you 
 I get wit you, handle that on a later note. 
 We o'er-dose eveything is death, we so close 
 I'm trying to tell these cats, but I let them do they thing... 
 Ready for the bad news till da phone ring 
 Son is dead, now I'm irate over my head seeking revenge. 
 Son is dead, son on your behalf trying to laugh 
 (Prodigy) 
 Check out the drill-dun, conceal guns 
 Play the hum leaning back checking out the action 
 On the benches we drinkin' X's 
 Yo twirl dat shit, while I spark this... 
 Sharply burn it down like an arsonist 
 Pull out the miz cause its time to bring the biz to kidz 
 And blow all hell fire out ya empire 
 Live as wire couldn't make my mobb expire or retire 
 I'm letting off till my arms tired 
 You set quite wit my head full of riot. 
 Our buyers, it clear for your ear to hear 
 I declare only live niggaz lock this year 
 '96-I lost my dun; '97-It got worse... 
 Pull money out the team, got to get mork... 
 And sat down you play the background when shots sound off 
 Flashbacks of how my man is gone, KB forever in my memory 
 I spill some Henny then I keep it moving 
 Yo, do our thing, we got this, rockin' this 
 Ain't nobody stoppin' this Rakim and Imfamous 
 Reck the hood for you and yours-No doubt crash the bars 
 You don't really wanna go against the source

 Surprise open eye, peep the foulness, wildness 
 Its bug, niggaz dug in the projects you holiday thug 
 Ease up all that illin and grillin 
 Get ya melon light up, you niggaz is butt 
 You want me, I'm reppin WB, what? 
 Where you find me at spillin Congac from a cup 
 With my heat next to my nuts 
 Never been afraid to bust 
 Slug rushin to your head like dust 
 If that wasn't enough as long as strong and tough 
 We squeeze back, better believe he no longer breath-black 
 Fuckin' wit these swayze cats 
 I got dreams of raising my little queen and nobody gonna stop that 
 In fact black, if you come at me don't come sloppy 
 All my baby girl got is a papi to guide her 
 Through this world of hatred 
 And I die to see that she make it 
 And die to let the nextman take it, is you stupid, UM... 
 (Rakim) 
 Yo, you wanna come test, son is mad from stress 
 Penalty is death, pay your last respects 
 We harass you reap if you slept or half step 
 We adapt to see who we can master next 
 After sex pass the bless for after effects 
 Relax your stress through mad physac, mad contact 
 Cash a check to get assets we blast techs 
 Dealing with the mental aspect on chest 
 So we create a trust, if you Dunns come to shot 
 Get hit with a twenty-one gun salute 
 I keep a loaded yet deadly 7SC 30 
 Soon as you it hit me I release Lyrics of Fury 
 And quick to say a poem to ricochet in your dome 
 My click made me leave the nickel-plated at home alone 
 So I can get chatter and be the better trend setter

 Kids rushing, what's your discussion 
 Y'all niggas talk alot of shit heard you on your tape fronting 
 I fake nothing, fuck around and push the wrong button 
 I dedicate my days to seeing your drip blood 
 I will always love gambino and scarface 
 Killa black no man can fill your shoes, now what's bad news 
 It couldn't get no worse, so what y'all niggas know about the turmoil

 Considered mad real, niggas feel the montana shit 
 Born official, my niggas that are gone I miss you 
 I shed a tear, see y'all niggas when I get there 
 Yo my dun did six years and still didn't hit the strip 
 I'm waiting on the day, when rikers island ciphers are incomplete 
 When I can sleep with no heat, hidden beneath the sheet 
 And I can relax with my air max, appearing on my feet 
 When I rhyme you enter my mind, seeing nigga's lead to excellence 
 I represented then manifested in the beat... respect this 
 Like a lexus jeep

 Leaves my enimies stretched for weeks, vexed from me 
 Especially they know my destiny, man they scared to death of me

 Infamous come through like the homicide 
 Hit guys, rip Dons, get mines, the thin line 
 (Verse 2: Prodigy) 
 Infamous who rap shit, power moves and connect wit 
 Empire, bless all my sons wit 
 Bank accounts 
 Many mansions down south 
 Fuck ABT, got protected 
 War strategies perfected 
 Bent all day, Alize party 
 Golf, fuck par 3, pimp, pusher, playa, couldn't be me 
 Hennessey raps, fully loaded with gats 
 Now how you like that 
 Time lapse 
 You lose, shoulda been strapped! 
 Be on your back like a new born 
 Niggas is corn-born, wit 
 Real cats who do this all day long 
 On and on till the break of dawn, it don't stop 
 Shit is hot like PJ's infested with cops 
 Jakes on a nigga ass, ninja break 'em like glass 
 Interrogated, they won't last 
 Would it make you laugh or make you cry? 
 On this side it's do-or-die 
 Ya get dead plus sun-dried, you're small fry 
 We on time with this, mace blindin shit 
 Gold mindin it, extended 9 clips 
 Trife life got my mind keyed up 
 Pull out the Tek-nology and team-o 
 With my cats and ??? blast 
 Direct splats to your jawbone 
 I lift that head up, homes, bent they hos and putos 
 Injured kid, Mobb-tician is the laws of life 
 Ain't it interestin, listen 
 It could happen to you 
 Now what would you think? (I don't know) 
 What would you do? (I don't know) 
 Can't beat ya gat, can't find ya crew 
 Far away from home in a land not new 
 So boom, outta place and I sue ya crew 
 Son, yo, they steppin in you 
 And it could happen to you 
 (Outro: Havoc) 
 KnowhutI'msayin? Said word to mutha, son! 
 Feels like a dream (word!) 
 It's like I just woke up, knowI'msayin? 
 I woke up in a like-like an ill sweat, son 
 Word up, this shit had me shook, son! 
 I don't know, man! 
 Fuckin' around with them other cats 
 4 pound, get hit with rounds 
 Leave a man down 
 Wrappin on a rat 
 The Infamous nuff said 
 (Enough motherfuckin said!)"

 (Intro / Mobb Deep): 
 Ha ha... 
 Yeah... 
 Uh huh right... 
 Part the crowd like the Red Sea... 
 Let's fight to this... 
 Don't even tempt me... 
 (Chorus / Mobb Deep): 
 We want to kill you... (make y'all niggaz fight to this) 
 We want to kill you... 
 (Prodigy): 
 Eh yo 
 Peace to our way of life 
 Hats off to all the trife 
 Let's toast to fully autos and foot long knives 
 Specially for stacks of green packs 
 My outfit ah perform, so blow all stained raps 
 Now let me take y'all niggaz back to my basics of this 
 Ya ancient to flip, fag catch a face lift 
 My shank do remarkable things for fakeness 
 My whole Mobb got the same patience 
 Throw on your tracks 8-6 
 And make moves like a space ship 
 We pack places, Infamous bangs ya nation 
 Ya light at the weight station 
 That weak shit need replacing, put this in heavy rotation 
 Overdose music 
 It's theraputic to the user 
 Driving wild under the influence of this 
 Careful, 'cause ya might just crash ya shit 
 Total ya whip and still pull my tape out the deck 
 Me and Mobb tryin' to connect like thirty thousand dollar links 
 Unpoppable, unstoppable, topple 
 (Cormega): 
 Yo, my drug cliental was bringing me money well 
 Smoking Buddha L's and weed so good 
 They leave a funny smell 
 Niggaz scoping me, hoping police is close to me 
 Mega regulatin' 
 The way shit's supposed to be 
 Gold chain choking me, cocaine provoking me 
 To live my destiny (ha) 
 Jacuzzi water soaking me 
 Floating in smoky Durango 
 Doing my thing yo, my mac milli 
 Sweeter than a mango 
 Son, you know the drilly 
 The drama is a part of me 
 Did time for cocaine, nines and armed robbery 
 My rhyme written graffiti is a live nigga prophecy 
 Mega poetic rhymes are like dimes but no credit 
 I leave ya mind paralysed dun, but don't wet it 
 Scarface persona, I acquired a taste for drama 
 And I embrace this, real shit 
 You banned from the projects 
 Your love here, ancient (fuck that) 
 Yo, I'ma see you 
 Nigga, you transperant see through 
 Rhymes fully automated, you semi crime related 
 Cormega and Mobb Deep rhyme amazing 
 Thug shit you can't fuck with... 
 What! 
 (Havoc): 
 Fuck ya bullshit rep, nigga you ass bet 
 Talking all that shit, don't even got cash yet 
 I floss, try to get away 
 No gats tossed 
 Got drama with my click, I'ma take it to the source 
 Q.B.C. representative, I'm just trying to live 
 If I can't get to you, I'ma take it to ya kids 
 Spray ya crib, fuck it son 
 Something gotta give 
 If I can't live then ain't nothing gonna live 
 That's dead ass 
 But to put this whole shit in a smash 
 You real, hit that ass up on four wheels 
 All jokes aside, you goin' squeal like them other rappers 
 You know we kick the truth, you want to clap us 
 I got this, strictly out the mouth nothing but hot shit 
 Pop shit, you couldn't fuck this when we drop shit 
 You helpless, put your whole shit outta service 
 Put on some old shit (Thank God for this) 
 Yo, if it wasn't 
 Them niggaz like us, you just be ash dust 
 Hustling for petty kid cash 
 Come on know, you know I know 
 When it comes to gats, I'ma a hoe 
 Never bite my tongue, let them player haters know how we coming 
 Straight coming through while you running 
 Get done-ed, have that ass shaking like a bitch when she coming 
 One in a mil, slip that ass like a mickie 
 It's fifty-fifty fucking with this, nigga just come and get me 
 No doubt... 
 (Chorus / Havoc) 
 We want to kill you (that's right) 
 We want to kill you (no doubt, that's right) 
 We want to kill you (no doubt, that's right) 
 We want to kill you (no doubt, that's right) 
 We want to kill you (no doubt, that's right) 
 We want to kill you (no doubt, that's right) 
 We want to kill you (no doubt, that's right) 
 We want to kill you (no doubt, that's right)"

 (Mobb Deep) 
 Shit is real on the muthafucking hill, God 
 Times is hard, visons blurred kid, I can't see far 
 Thinking will I be the next nigga deceased 
 Over some bullshit beef I pack heat 
 Son it's '96 and I ain't going out like that 
 Never roll a dollo 'cause my crew got my back 
 And it's a fact, niggas don't know how to act 
 Till I cop back, react, leave 'em laying on they back 
 Sometime I try to maintain and chill 
 Stop my brain from thinking, restrain from grabbing my steal 
 I'm stressed out, trying to live right on the wrong route 
 Thinking of ways to get loot in large amounts 
 So I chill on the block, nigga respect mines 
 A giver wit the mac and the motherfucking tech nines 
 So pack steel if you come through, front if you want to 
 Before you do, so let me warn you 
 We more infamous, crime shit, take it to the gat 
 Fuck the rhyme shit, you reminded of what the nine did 
 Remanded, QBC, then left stranded 
 We cock cannons, punishing and back handing 
 (M.O.P.) 
 In order to survive the game 
 Know the game 
 Hold your name 
 And let them niggas know 
 The way to win the war 
 Attend the war 
 End the war 
 And let your hammer go 
 (Kool G. Rap) 
 Yo, I'll leave your whole body twisted when you get lifted 
 And police'll have to fist rumblistics on a bisket, another statistic 
 I try to chill but you insisted coming all in my district 
 I don't know why the fuck you risk it 
 I be more deep, walking the streets, packing the heat 
 Bring the cowmeat, you'll lifted off your feet 
 And leave you sleeping on the concrete 
 Get blown at home or whatever is on your bone 
 Get to flown to your dome, blow chromosones out your flesh and bones 
 Hitman for hire, who's the next one to expire 
 Shoot it up in black attire, hit you wit the rapid fire 
 The stainless bisket will leave your brain smoking 
 Your whole frame broken and clothes soaken, head blown the fuck open 
 Try to step inside my fort and get caught 
 Wit the trey pound shorter left on the sidewalks of New York 
 The decompose, blood flows are holes in your clothes, eyes closed 
 Body be frozed, posing for pictures with a rose 
 Head to your toes, look like you got wetted with a hose 
 The road you choose got your brain drain through your nose, nigga 
 So who be committing crimes, dangerous minds, put two to your spine 
 Lay you behind enemy lines 
 When we cross it and leave you like a broken faucet 
 The underworld production family can reinforce it 
 (Mobb Deep) 
 Yo, when shit get real, it ain't what you expected 
 Me and kikos are known to get hectic 
 Only to wreck shit, many slugs in all directions 
 Make you see the light when my shot makes connections 
 Niggas get their face split in section 
 Shooked, using ice grilled looks for they protection 
 We absorb everything you fear 
 And indulging in crime-filled atmosphere 
 This shit ain't nuttin' new, it's only things that we used to 
 We used to stick niggas on the F through to 
 The E train, when it's time to recruit 
 I humble on the D train, see my man D 
 Don't need to purchase my cocaine, word to my newborn seed 
 A nigga gotta make loot to support greed 
 On the wildside of the fence, the shit is on the verge of explosion 
 It's so cold, you might get frozen 
 If you leave yourself vulnerable and time lasping 
 Fools collasping and caught up in gun clapping 
 No matter who you are if you know many faces 
 I don't discriminate, my shot bleed all races 
 And coaches, we sorts like vultures 
 Eating your insides like ulcers and pour niggas closer nigga"

 Livin' the life, steady keepin' it tight 
 Never take a funny nigga's advice 
 Pimpin' the game, never trippin' on fame 
 When I'm done you'll respect my name 
 The vision is real, time will reveal 
 As I pack the steel 
 Treasure I found, with the platinum sound 
 That no other can put down 
 (Jadakiss) 
 I take a lot of advice, my lifestyle's product and dice 
 And guns that'll target your pipe 
 It's sorta like approachin the don, wrong word, wrong vibe 
 4-5'll leave most of you harmed 
 Move coke through the ocean, paid off the coast guard 
 Sailed out to Cuba, made sure shit's potent 
 Violence with caution... 
 And ain't too many niggaz you know that got pilots transportin 
 Egg nog whip, four door Ferrari 
 2 M-16s's, I beg y'all flip 
 I'm the hardest nigga you know, check it out 
 Turned 40 ki's to 80 when I get in the door 
 So I flash like cameras, blast like hammers 
 I worry about y'all lil' niggaz just like your grandmas 
 Get shit jumpin' like the playoffs 
 Every twenty minutes a day give or take I knock a K off 
 Been in the hood for real long 
 Catch me anywhere and I got a half a mill' on 
 Jada, kiss you now, you die now - why later?

 Out the box brand new shit for you to get crunk 
 Heavyweight bars and hooks for you to turn up 
 This is that gangsta shit the world'll bump 
 This is that major shit, we burnin up 
 Keep your ear to the street and you gon' listen to us 
 Pull up my V is crushed, I blew up the spot 
 Wit the twenties that keep spinnin after I stop 
 When my bunny step out the car e'rybody watch 
 When the Lambo' doors lift up, faces drop 
 Somebody daughter fin' ta get fucked tonight 
 'Cause we fillin up the cars and the trucks tonight, what

 C'mon, yeah 
 Uh, uh, yeah, yo

 Only time I drop a dime when I'm leavin' a bitch 
 Am I allowed to hit 'em? These thugs that's actin'

 'Cause we love y'all, love us back and we love y'all more 
 Well well, damn it to hell fuck this ... 
 We have been all scratch, recharging the batteries 
 Had to regroup, reboot the system, press reset 
 A fresh start right from where we started at 
 We only go forward we never go back 
 But sometimes you gotta step outside to look in 
 Got an eagle eye view and a vulture's mentality 
 A poor man's lifestyle and a rich man's salary 
 Yeah that new shit you need to get with the time 
 The infamous life and time the havoc and peak 
 ...Music substance this over ... shallow 
 Feel it from the speakers down to your bone marrow 
 See the audience is my love and I won't be a liar 
 If I ain't say I love most of lil bit of fire 
 But here, take my hand and we gonna keep it place in hot 
 The hating our relationship never stop

 Still in the jungle where the lions be 
 So you know right where to find me on a corner or the office 
 Mob bosses, ... I talking cause this sour got his coffin 
 My swag got him nauseous, hurry get him the ... key 
 Home I gotta going, niggers in china ...get money 
 Gotta fed his ... for this ... short film while we make movies 
 Repeat my lips, read my lips, we got clips to heat your spit 
 Don't give a fuck about jealousy and female feelings 
 You know that I be knowing gotta put them where the dome is 
 They ... like a bunch of locusts, so I'm so focus 
 I leave these niggers dead where they stand 
 These niggers ...

 You are now tuned into the sounds 
 Handcrafted and designed, by the H A V O C 
 Havoc beats, (fo' real) A-L-C talkin' 
 (Verse 1: Havoc) 
 You know my name, you know my pedigree 
 It ain't a game, who could do this better then me? 
 As far as I'm concerned, niggaz better play that position 
 Their slugs will be hittin' that target, neva missin' 
 And - how many times, do I gotta go through that beef 
 Protectin' my shines, wit nothin' but that big heat 
 I'm down to Earth, but niggaz wanna to bring it 
 Up to that next level, swing, don't sing it 
 But I warn y'all, tear y'all niggaz in new ass off 
 Compared to Hav', nigga I'm dope, you lactose 
 Pass the roach; you laughin' I'ma get that last tot 
 Gangstas to fly bitches, I rap for those 
 And - layin' it down, just like it's suppose to be laid 
 Check mate on a nigga when my moves is made 
 Don't believe? The proof is in the pudding, my nigga 
 Straight face when I'm pullin' the trigger, you didn't know? 
 (Chorus: Prodigy) 
 Yo it's the word, you hate P? 
 You hatin' on Hav?, the A-L-C?

 Aiyo it's time, time for me to shock and amaze 
 The best out, chest out when I'm rockin' the stage 
 I'm certified, A-L-C claimin' his clout 
 And I'ma show you what that name's about 
 And - the +Quiet Storm+ (ssshhh!) blew out the fuckin' lights 
 Flood the block and overflow personal 
 Trained pipes, me and H, yeah we the same type 
 Get the checks in the daytime and bang out in the late nights 
 Plus, I'm on the grind, snatch a quarter 'mil from KOCH 
 'Cause I shook the spot, it went from the bottom to the top 
 (Get that) I fake then I'm swingin' the rock 
 Anyway you cut the cake I get my CREAM off the top 
 CREAM of the crop, on sideways, leanin' and drop 
 Top speed till the cops give me a reason to stop 
 Even in the winter season I'm hot 
 Like Ripley's if you a thug, I don't know if I Believe It Or Not!

 Give bitches the chills, have em' payin' my bills, she want a thug bangin' her out, you niggas ain't real 
 If I ain't got the big 3 pound with the scope, I prolly got the pocket size 25 joint 
 Tonight we scheamin on this niggas home, he turn on the lights we be sittin' in the room 
 Niggas like me we a dangerous thing, we shoot anywhere, anytime, down for anything 
 Couple a bucks make a coward heart jump, these slugs in my gun do away with chumps

 Man I want niggaz to hear this shit right here

 Knahmsayin? 
 Can't blame niggaz doe

 Y'know? Truth always reveal itself though 
 That's what we here for 
 But umm, we gon' take this little intermission 
 To say what the fuck we got to say, y'know? 
 (Let me, let me here something then) 
 It's like this Dunn 
 Infamous 'til the name wear out, time and again without doubt 
 I take the murder one route, why clowns pulled out and copped out 
 Poppin' they, little heads out they hole 
 Stickin' they chest out, actin' like they in control 
 But hold up, I've been doin' this since we was kids 
 And all you other niggaz gotta ask if you could live 
 Your projects is on our dicks, you need to quit 
 And let us rep that for them, your raps ain't shit 
 Your background's incorrect, your song push no effect 
 On the people, don't try to play my part 
 Don't try to say my words that I lived and survived 
 Y'all niggaz got some nerve, be careful at night 
 You might bump into a tru to life nigga like Pee 
 Get beat over your head wit gun handles 
 Check the manual you went about it all wrong 
 We put you on the life, taught you how to drink right 
 And how to speak like a nigga livin' street life 
 How to chase down liquor wit more liquor 
 As a youth I was over proof, now I'm sober than your hoa 
 But still pound on a nigga 'til he throw up 
 Straighten up there's too much to lose 
 Get your head on right, we got the world to gain 
 And I'ma take mines while you sit around and complain 
 And I innovate raps while your song is playin' 
 Looks tastes and feels to me like no frills 
 Take that bullshit back to the two inch reel 
 Hit the studio hard, crash the track board like a smashed car 
 Then maybe next rhyme you could fuck wit the God 
 Pee wit a capital P 
 And don't ever in your life try to rock wit me 
 On no days there's no rap page I can't top 
 I, splash the half ass trash you dropped 
 You get chopped in half, your little raff ain't last long 
 My shit came out and you got escorted to the door 
 You just a fuckin' clown here to entertain us all 
 I bring the gravity Dunn you're gonna fall 
 Anytime y'all niggaz wanna mic brawl 
 Don't forget to me it's bloodsport bring your dogs 
 Nigga

 Homicide muzak, Dunn stand up on the count 
 Is you involved wit it or out, I'm goin' out 
 It's no doubt, I hold my niggaz 'cause they hold me too 
 Like if you show love for me then I'll show love for you 
 And if you in a situation, just be patient 
 Give me a minute and I'll be there with no hesitation 
 And all them bitches that you hittin' we done ran through that 
 Plus dissed them, that's why they can't stand our raps 
 As for you couldn't give a fuck on how you feel 
 Never allowed, and break 'em up like a whack album 
 Go against to get punished, fuck you 
 Take it out on who run wit, then touch you 
 Ain't no room for the both of us you pop too much shit 
 I just handle shit and put a clamp, on them loose lips 
 I sink 'em like the Titanic, you be deep in some shit 
 I didn't stutter can't hear nigga read my lips 
 Who you runnin' wit, shit you won't knock this click 
 You just frontin' wit imaginary pies you flip 
 Aiyyo Pee, my mind and yours put together's like a pack wild piranhas 
 Carnivores it's me thirstin' 
 It only worsen, you cats'll get the closed curtain 
 While your catch me on your networkin', you dick jerkin' 
 Your future's uncertain, get a grip close your mouth 
 'Cause you know them shits sink ships 
 It's foul, tryin' to go against the morale 
 Move the crowd do my thing leave your ears aroused

193,Mobb Deep,hiphop,Must Go Hard,"If you think that is so damn easy, 
 Then what do you need me for? 
 (What the fuck did you make me for?) 
 Just look at that state of you 
 (It's crazy out here!) 
 Babe, snap out of it 
 You're not listening to this! 
 Hard is the definition, 
 Searching for recognition, 
 Now I'm tough, no barber shops... 
 With guns that will change your move 
 Chess game, make a move 
 ... They want you as toy, 
 Not to play with fool... 
 No baseball without the boys play... 
 Things... what a vision, what a fight, 
 ... Patience for the cash, 
 Now they're going for the night, 
 Never did, never... hold up! 
 Cops just rolled up, 
 All the opened doors just closed shut... 
 ... Now fuck talking! 
 This wasn't done often, worry about... and gun tossing. 
 He thought he was good,... 
 Want me to leave, so he start thinking that he should 
 And soon he saw his face on the service, 
 The cops shut him in his head on purpose! 
 What a fuck! 
 If you think that is so damn easy, 
 Then what do you need me for? 
 Just look at that state of you 
 Babe, snap out of it 
 You're not listening to this! 
 Grown up I had a friend named Ron, the John terrorist, 
 His time is now... and gone, 
 And those memories I shall forever change! 
 This air, he can't no longer inhale, 
 Such a disappointment that the job 
 That was done to him was for real! 
 What a... I'm left in an unreached base 
 I'm left in an unreached base, 
 When I think how I could have stopped it. 
 Damn, only if quicker than us 
 He was adopted quicker 
 Than we'd probably would have been found 
 At the bottom of that river. 
 He didn't deserve that, he was a good kid, 
 He wasn't a bad dude... 
 I ain't had much, but to him 
 My house is disney land! 
 Recipe is forever,... 
 Air continues to go, 
 But in my mind he never... 
 'Cause I believe I carry his soul, 
 Maybe that explains why I'm so ambitious... 
 Now, I've had it up to here 
 Don't ever try that again 
 Why are you so quiet so suddenly? 
 Go on, have it! 
 You're just dying to try me! 
 Don't! don't!"

 Before I get the watch - I get the big glock 
 Before I step foot in the V - I get the stash box 
 No matter the casin', I'm bringin' the heat 
 Take my kids to Sesame Place, I'm bringin' my heat 
 Fo'sho, you neva know it might pop off 
 Better safe than sorry, niggaz could neva rob me 
 Or reach the hand toward me and in any type fashion 
 Fuck what you heard or think my shit blastin' 
 We hittin' the club; I get my contraband 
 You fuckin' wit us? You'd rather suck madd dick 
 Before I squeeze I aim at your hat then 
 Without hesitation, turn your shit backwards 
 Soon as I purchase my kicks; I put the gemstars in 
 So if they lock me up; my razor makes madd hits 
 Before I die, the world gon' hear me 
 And make me rich, my kids will be filthy 
 (Chorus: Prodigy) 
 Priorities; put my gun on, I'm ready for the day 
 Two; tryin' hit you before you hit me 
 C; he a good nigga, don't call cross P 
 Four; balance my hatred and love more

 Six; neva let fear control me dunn

 Eight; live by four, it should be straight

 Ayo, nigga I don't shoot cars up or dawgs up 
 That shit I did when I was sixteen, word up! 
 That's child play now I gotta taste for blood 
 I gotta see some meat hangin' 'fore the jobs well done 
 I need to see a nigga drop 'fore I make my gun stop 
 And before I start shootin', I make sure you hop 
 Niggaz wind me up and wind me up 
 Till I pop up on your scene like Jack in the Box 
 With the two toppings, cuttin' at you up like butter 
 VA style nigga your meat get smothered 
 Mobb style nigga me and my blood brothers kill 
 Pretty boy, rappers if their songs speak others 
 Oh you shot niggaz before? That's cool wit me

 Before all this rap shit, I was already bugged

 Yo... 
 Ain't no hard time invented that Havoc can't handle 
 If cats only knew all the shit I been through 
 Homicide, suicide, am I, losin my mind? 
 Just, standin my ground keep it bottled up inside 
 Practice what I preach Dunn, ride for my loved ones 
 Asked about my life, no doubt had a tough one 
 Did dirt, got dirt, shit only got worse 
 Been asked God why he put me on this earth, yo 
 Not for nuttin Dunn, I want it all - can you blame me? 
 Niggaz just be settlin for crumbs 
 How dumb, how come, with no outcome? 
 Ten years later niggaz still in the slums 
 Strung off the next shit, dyin' for they next shit 
 Foamin from the mouth for the next man necklace 
 And how about that, niggaz too grown for that 
 I'm holdin' it down, now where your head at? Yo 
 Chorus: Mobb Deep (repeat 2X) 
 I ain't goin' back, I ain't lookin' back 
 I'm movin ahead, now how about that? 
 Hell no black, I'm where the paper at 
 Long as I don't forget where I came from 
 (Prodigy) 
 We do it the Mobb way - leave 'em lookin' like a strawberry 
 My outlook on life is quite very - positive 
 I'm a content fella 
 Until you tamper with my plans to go on further 
 Fuck the hassle, it ain't worth my energy unless I must 
 If you insist, I'll be more than glad till his beef marriage 
 Me and you till death do us 
 Scrape my fingertips on bricks, forty-two shot clips 
 That's my shit, do it like the old timers 
 I use a wide holster, it's more discrete while I'm post up 
 Or in motion, most niggaz be floatin 
 Don't even make eye contact, walkin' 
 Dunn, pay attention that's how niggaz die sooner 
 Watch who you pass and it might be a reaper 
 Watch my niggaz we'll jump when you least thought 
 We came from the streets up, now we put G's up, so 
 (Havoc) 
 Yo, had time to think when just on the brink of death 
 At my front door me receivin slugs? 
 Only twenty-five, got fifty more to go 
 And knows, their plot I hope they ass die slow 
 How though no dough, please don't show 
 Like my man Twist said don't even see me when I blow 
 Got, issue with my foes best believe I'ma solve em 
 And laugh at your petty-ass problems

 Listen, if it's war me and my dunns gon' come through

 Ey'day, we gon' graveyard shift for you 
 We gon' take turn stakin' your crib, watchin' your moves 
 Calculatin' your steps, plottin' on your head, dunn 
 How you gon' leave a job half done 
 How you gon' buck my man and walk around like you did sumin' 
 Like he don't got family dukes 
 Like we ain't gon' ride for his gun shot wounds 
 My nigga took two in his lungs, one in his face 
 And you gon' pay the ultimate toll for his pain 
 And I don't give a fuck about them motha'fuckin' goons you got 
 All time niggaz get shot, be in Brooklyn, Manhattan 
 Queens and the Bronx, Long Island, Staten Island 
 Now let's get it on! 
 (Chorus 1: Prodigy) 
 C'mon let's be men about things 
 When my gun bangs and you hit 
 Don't snitch, don't squeal 
 Niggaz wanna buck their gun 
 But when they get touched they tell 
 Even if I'm layin' on my death bed 
 On my way outta here, dawg 
 I won't talk, I won't tell, I won't squeal 
 I'ma just make sure niggaz get peeled 
 Somebody get killed 
 (Verse 2: Havoc) 
 Yo, yo, uh-huh, yo, um, yo, yo 
 It's amazin' how these homo niggaz talk like bitches 
 Claim they're thug, get bagged, now switch position 
 Don't know a nigga behind them closed doors 
 Is he talkin'?, or keep it gangsta at all? 
 Mouf tight, who gives a fuck, let them pin that murder 
 Knows nothin' about nothin', it won't go no further 
 They could catch me red handed with the smokin' burner 
 Most of y'all niggaz, probably fold and shiver 
 Like a bitch that couldn't even hold a ligger 
 But when that ass hit the block, that ass is gon' get sicker 
 'Cause um, we don't play those games 
 Fuck around, probably gave the D's a list with our Government names 
 Got a slug with your name on it and the date on it 
 Niggaz wanna snitch, it's only right I hate on it 
 I'ma give that ass and I put weight on it 
 That motha'fucka empty shit, yeah we on it 
 (Chorus 2: Prodigy) 
 C'mon let's be men about things 
 When my gun bangs and you hit 
 Don't snitch 
 'Cause when I laid in the emergency and D's came to question me 
 I ain't speak 
 Even when I'm layin' on the death bed 
 On my way outta here, dawg 
 I won't talk, I won't tell, I won't squeal 
 I'ma just make sure heads get peeled 
 Niggaz get killed 
 (Verse 3: Ty Nitty) 
 Yo, yo, yo, yo 
 When it was time to ride, we rode 
 Emptied out and reload 
 I was tryin' to hit 'em in his dome 
 Likely I didn't, but I think I hit 'em 
 That nigga ain't dead, so we ain't done wit 'em 
 He must be out of his fuckin' mind 
 Fuckin' wit mine, now that nigga gotta get it one mo' time 
 Word to my mother, it's on when he recover 
 He bucked my dunn, now it's gon' repercussion 
 Man that nigga get himself in somethin' deep 
 For thinkin' somethin' sweet 
 Now I'ma peel his fuckin' meat 
 If he ain't tell the cops already 
 It's time for you to go, whether or not you're read 
 'Cause I love my niggaz, so I ride for my niggaz 
 And if it gotta be then I'll die for my niggaz 
 And if they can't live unless if I get you 
 Then I guess I gotta do what I gotta do, fo' real"

 Rhymes rusty like nails 
 Spit 'em catch lock jaw 
 Cook shit, spit it up, sit it on the floor 
 To prevent lop side I never slam the door 
 To never get shitted on, don抰 put my faith in whores 
 Never let my information leak through my forewall 
 They say I'm all to sick 'cause I screen my calls 
 No matter if I'm in the right, I'm a probable cause 
 Keep my stash ??? while your guns get tossed 
 Niggas live by the law then they die by the law 
 Then I live by the gat and I'm a die by that 
 Dun I used to be the tunnel now we regular ?spress? 
 Son it's strictly dom bitches never catch me with rats

 We carry big ones small ones sneak 'em into clubs dun if you ever catch

 A yo you ran, started feeling numb in your hand 
 Felt something dripping looked down seen your arm leaking 
 You get excited and start to panic 
 Lucky for you, ya had your track shoes on and blew it 
 My arch louder than a Doberman bark 
 Sober you up, challenge your heart, see where it's at 
 I caught this on dude tried to shank me 
 Stupid fuck frankly I pulled out and left his ass soggy 
 Keep rhyming on the Ragu can't seem to shake it 
 Ruger on the left side of my hips for maitnence 
 I fix all your problems, handle it bitch 
 Use a maytag nigga and ya won't do shit 
 After you shot you got all emotional with mommy 
 Laying in emergency throw the ?dease? on me 
 Squeeller I thought you was a drug dealer thug killer 
 But at the end you kept it realer 
 That's why... 
 (Prodigy) 
 A yo I leave a last impression when my shit gets scared 
 Tying to hang with the elite but a nigga got bought 
 When it's time to mello out stare straight into stars 
 Then I sabotage your brain with these last 8-balls 
 With your ice grill making me laugh on your behalf 
 Have a nigga skin graph I'm talking out of the ass 
 Play you like the ab getting bent off, credit from poppy 
 Nock niggas down when I get like that 
 So start me 
 (Havoc) 
 I'm putting holes like the pores ??? with bacardi 
 My gun dun step aside the place and make heads spin 
 Are shit, it go to mobb nigga keep your distance 
 Fake fucks keep coming out using infamous 
 I'll say it for the last motherfucking time bitches 
 Come with your own shit or get stomped and shot 
 By Queens bridge at the next industry convention 
 That's why...

 If you featherweight, lyrics blow your back 
 Crack your vertabrae, lookin' for a better way 
 To get my point across, thoughts accelerate 
 At the same speed, of the murder rate 
 Lord, never perpetrate a fraud, till my nigga Carlton Fisk

 About the foul shit goin' on in my life, current event 
 It's evident I smoke ciggarette down to Brownsville 
 Thinkin' to myself -- how many lives must my pound kill? 
 Hopefully none, ain't the one to give chase 
 Hemmed by Jake, worryin who might turn state's 
 So I chill, put my killa niggaz on the battlefield 
 On the low plottin silent murderer, never doubt still 
 Never follow beef hey beef follow me 
 Wanna settle in the court I say settle in the streets 
 Like our pops did it, you got gats get hot with it

 Stash my dough secure the funds of profit

 Yo, extreme rhyme niggaz, you wastin your time 
 Fuckin' with my niggaz, extraordinary line swishin 
 Your mind out position, tryin' to figure this shit 
 Rewind it and listen quick, you might miss this

 Doin' this for too long, to not come strong 
 You're only a pawn of Viet Dong 
 Tryin' to form against mines, you musta just been born 
 Secluded on a distant farm 
 This is the real world, where niggaz get shot and shanked 
 Where there's tremendous pain, you get your frame inflamed 
 Crushed to dust, by the next man's clutch 
 It's Infamous you fucks, intense bad luck...

 Yo, (Hold ya head, hold ya head dunn) Yeah 
 (Havoc) 
 It's bad enough I gotta grow up the fast way 
 These things going on got me thinkin' they the last days 
 Tryin' to come up, but shorty with a plan 
 Doin' my best but can't see the promise in my land 
 These older cats wildin out over turf dog 
 I'm caught in the middle and it can't get worse 
 Just the other day I saw my homie wheeled off in a hearse 
 So used to it, it don't even hurt 
 My heart's numb, guess that's the Dunn Dunn 
 Can't speak on it, 'less you been where I come from 
 Stuck like bubble gum with no help from anyone 
 Moms got four others -- my four younger brothers 
 We're not supposed to do the tender age of ten 
 Dog, we're in the same boat I can't turn to my friends 
 Fore I lay me down to sleep pray to God that I'll see the next day 
 And do my best, hope these streets don't get me 
 CHORUS: Havoc (Prodigy) 2x 
 (It's real) Keep that park open 
 Baby I just wanna play 
 (Uh-huh) Keep that park open 
 Baby I just wanna play 
 (No doubt) Keep that park open 
 Baby I just wanna play 
 (That's right) Keep that park open 
 Baby I just wanna play 
 (Prodigy) 
 Yo' baby, I'm strugglin for crumbs, survivin the unheard of 
 Growin' up amongst the violence and drugs 
 Growin' up against the world and such (Uh-huh) 
 We the young black future of the world and plus 
 We the team that'll crush anybody you bring 
 We the one that's gon' hold it down, it's no thing no sweat 
 It barely take no strength, you cowards ain't built for this 
 (And it's real) All we wanna do is hit the park 
 Play all day and night without a care in the world 
 But it's drama in my hood, sho' it's hard to chill 
 You gotta stay on point and sharp as hell 
 Dunn, we just wanna have fun 
 I just wanna be with my dawgs, 'cause we all we got 
 Don't why it is, but that's how it is 
 I just wanna be with my clique 'cause that's where I fit 
 (Havoc) 
 (It's real) Where do I turn to, who do I console in? 
 I know I'm just a shorty but I want my wrist frozen nice 
 As I sat and thought many a nights 
 I could do the right thing or get read my rights 
 It's life, in the hood 
 Everything that look, it ain't 
 I stole base, now I'm runnin' from home plate 
 Runnin' from jake, sweat runnin' down my face 
 And I can pay for every move I make 
 (Prodigy) 
 Just enjoy your youth, you only live once 
 Lil' dunn control yourself, learn discipline 
 And show some respect for others 
 Shit is serious on the street, you playin' with fire 
 Concentrate on yourself and don't follow nobody 
 Hit them school books, so you ain't gotta borrow no money 
 These is jewels for you that you gon' wear forever 
 From us to y'all, now listen up to pa 
 (Woman singer) 
 Mothers child 
 Has to go and travel into the wild 
 Lord she had a heavenly sky 
 Sweet saint he Lord 
 Thank you God

 Power raps inside my skull cap like a brick stack, the kid is back 
 I told y'all niggaz ninety-eight list that 
 Yo, ninety-nine I piss on rap 
 Two thousand where your pistols at? 
 Dunn, we be the men in black fatigue 
 Thirty-thousand dollar chains that swing 
 Yo catch me in the street, poppin' that bullshit 
 Catch a fat lip, hoes all over your shit 
 Bust guns like, nuts all over your bitch 
 Yo youse a woman, tell me what the fuck you tryin' to do when 
 You're growlin all over the top, you get chewed when 
 I touch that shit, not only that on the concrete 
 We splash more niggaz than the wavepool did 
 Check out my new shit, we blood spill, you still ice grill 
 Mad cause your clique's shit is homo, the Mobb stay real 
 You steady playin' the field 
 Nigga you sideline rhyme 
 Customers complain they can't feel 
 You cooked up a half-ass meal 
 It's time for me to catch burn on the wheels of steel 
 My shit fills, the appetite of the populace 
 We could do it via satellites and such 
 And show the world how that ass get bust 
 Ever since a little youth, I had this lust 
 To pick up the motherfuckin pen and just rush 
 Like morphine beats, through the wires of the EPS plus 
 You get penalized, for tryin' to rock with the utmost 
 Get branded, for bein weak the most, now be ghost 
 The fuck outta here, with that bullshit you tryin' to share 
 With the planet, you need to be shot rappin' 
 I got sickle cell I feel the pain all year, what's happenin' 
 Fake thug wanna front like they contractin 
 Numbers on my head, Dunn please, I'm here waitin 
 You can't touch me, there's no fake love amongst me 
 There's no fake niggaz that's run with me 
 Somebody gave y'all the wrong info, I ain't the Kiko 
 You nympho, put me on to where you breathe at 
 You 'sposed to taught that bitch much better than that 
 I dwell, where the rest of my vets is at 
 From, some to 'Ville to BX and back 
 To the lab and the dungeon 
 My house of reresentatives stay starvin, beats thumpin 
 We unholy, cause there ain't a part missin' 
 My commission, sit at the table like the last supper 
 Fucker... {*echoes*}"

 And all these niggas be lookin' for a lick to hit 
 'Cause it don't look like we leavin' these bricks to quit 
 On them hot summer nights we be servin' them whites 
 On them cold winter days we be shootin AK's 
 You ain't safe around here or in the yard 
 Its everyman for himself nigga livin' is hard 
 You see the cars, the bars, the ghetto super stars 
 Some niggas got money and forgot who they are 
 We rob, kill, steal, whatever 
 (""Ayo dunn when you gettin' out the hood""), Never 
 My people need me, my heart is still here 
 Even tho police be hatin' I'm still here 
 I'm standin on this corner till my pockets bigger 
 I'm goin' to my grave as a project nigga

 I ain't pickin' seed out my weed since '94 
 In New York, the projects is where we feel safe 
 Surrounded by the others like us, we embrace 
 All the bullshit, get you niggas a void 
 This is our life, we ain't got no choice 
 Look we enjoy ourselves in the middle of hell 
 Shots poppin' niggas might run up on you with and tell 
 Like blow you away, you'll die with ya gun on ya waist 
 Half assed in a bare cold case 
 Nigga you ain't got strength like the Mobb and G-Unit 
 In the ghetto, my niggas rear run up in ya place

 Got mad drama but we still out clubbin 
 We still out gunnin, dumpin the Mac clips 
 Homie we got this and y'all ain't have this 
 Baby ain't nothin' you know I'm spittin' that crack shit 
 Like I'm still on the block, bunch of police flippin 
 Still in the kitchen cookin, workin that Trip Beam 
 Have fiends baggin watch them lick the plate clean 
 Do this for my niggas up north from them state greens 
 Bustin' them hammers for clippin my sing sing 
 All my hood niggas don't worry just maintain 
 You know what it is G-Unit's what I bang

 Burn the whole metropolis, lyrical warfare 
 Hip-hop Apocalypse, strap devils to the chairs 
 Start shockin' shit, Q you, I chew through 
 We could battle in the projects and give or take the clue 
 Flex could get one too, the wait, I'm supplyin' 
 My crew pop, they iron from HTM to the peaks of Mount Zion 
 I'm ready for the showdown 
 Mention my name, cowboy, watch it go down

 Roll with minds, don't give a fuck if you don't like it 
 With niggas that's invited without recited, ignited 
 It burn mad slow and that's why I'll easily light it 
 Me and the ghettos reunited, all the broads is excited 
 Your ass looks stupid, tryna fight it 
 You wanna get your ass smacked up 
 So you can dig into the stash that I stacked up 
 But when my Queens, niggas flashed then you backed up 
 Keep my dogs fed, so they can shit when niggas act up 
 It's the L, nigga, dot com, dot hot lead red dot on your head be 
 And the rappers you idolized that idolized me 
 I walk in the spot, niggas part like the Red Sea 
 And Todd's Shop of Horrors, we battle to the death tonight

 Like the rebels in Nicaragua but I can take it farther

 We climax in ninety-five, wit demo raw raps is knives 
 To skin all y'all cats alive 
 Take your time don't rush the clock, Infamous rock for good now 
 Pass like my duns on lock holdin' the pot down slow 
 But assuring this, spoon-feeding these 
 Starvin ass heads catchin shakes, feenishly 
 I ball in this, word assortin this, probably recording this 
 Of course kids keepin' they sights upon this

 Yo, for my QBC duns, it's all real hold it down 
 You bust yours, we bust ours and stand on firm ground 
 Pass the dutchie while I, handle the Henny thinkin' 
 You never catch me sleepin', stay on top of this properly 
 I know they watchin me, if not they probably waitin for a downfall 
 Scheming on my property, we got the remedy 
 Let 'em get a little cold, let 'em smell the tree smoke 
 Hit 'em where we blow and don't let nobody know 
 The snakes in the grass, you gotta watch where you move 
 Son, shots get loaded, don't ever run wit the crowd son 
 Stick and move, you hear me? 
 And that's the way we rock it, the only way to live 
 If you really think about it 
 Every move is humble wit precision, careful thought decisions 
 And my whole cli-tique the same vision 
 41st till I dearly depart, till then I'll be somewhere gettin' bent up in a den 
 Sippin gin, while you shook cats just pretend to be something 
 That your not and that's not good my friend 
 On a personal, I ain't even feelin' you cats 
 Don't even acknowledge the fact that you weak raps 
 We bust gats at, on the reg laughed at

 Four pounds, stumbled off grounds 
 Fire off many a rounds, I heard return fire 3% of the time 
 Your dogs was wives actin' like girls, get feminine when handlin guns 
 You could run or take the window, son 
 Or feel this hot one, we rip all strifes dun dun 
 Without a fight son, we keep the house dope like ?pie fendis? 
 We twist and pop Henny, gettin' wet on the daily, and 
 Peers get chilly, turnin' macks fully 
 Now they bandin, court rehanded and got remanded, fought 
 A one to three degree from V-O-P and N-C-C-V 
 And send me up a hub to a state facilities 
 What could I do but sneak, burn a tree, or tobacco leaf 
 Or wait until my time served and get released 
 Cool, back on the streets I seen some old drama 
 I still hold heat to send your ass straight to trauma 
 These kids started to drilling like they ready and willing 
 I gave 'em exactly no time to switch feelings 
 Pulled out, to my man, look out 
 Commits to warfare, and rock these to sleep like this here 
 Seventy-two like as if I was back on the top 
 Hours of thinkin' about how I'ma tip they ass up out the basket 
 Beligerant glass heads, I'm bashing 
 No knowledge of the man nor his action 
 Class now is session, ""Soldiers boys, today's aim is: Never show your heat

 The Infamous Mobb, word to God 
 (Verse 1: Havoc) 
 To all them niggaz, reppin' they hood, it's all good 
 It's all good, till you step out of line 
 Went in the dome, out of sight, you out mind 
 Some like chrome, bag a bitch like phone time 
 You phoned them, I regulate, who am I? 
 Havoc and Prodigy, will go back, like go blind 
 '96 combined, put on all the people, we all shine 
 Every mother of the clique created 
 (Verse 2: Prodigy) 
 Yo, the heavy metal king hold big shit, with spare clips 
 You see the clips when the mac spit your top got split 
 Layin' dead with open eyes close his eyelids 
 Turn off his lights switch to darkness, it's deeper then the abyss 
 Its street life, blood on my kicks, shit on my knife 
 You'se the wild child, kid cold turnin' men into mice 
 I was born to take power leave my mark on this planet 
 The Phantom of Crime Rap, niggaz is left stranded 
 Shut down your operation, closed for business 
 Leave a foul taste in your mouth, like Guinness 
 POW niggaz is found, MIA 
 We move like the Special Forces, Green Beret 
 Heavily around my throat, I don't play 
 Shit brand new, back in eighty-nine, the same way 
 The God P walk with a limp, see, but simply 
 To simplify shit, no man can go against me 
 Test me you must be bent G, don't tempt me 
 I had this full clip for so long, it needs to be empty 
 The reason why it full for so long, 'cause I don't waste shit 
 You properly hit, blood in your mouth, so you could taste it 
 Quiet as kept, I lay back and watch the world spin 
 I hear thugs, claimin' that they gon' rob the Mobb 
 When they see us, I tell you what black, here's the issue 
 It's a package deal, you rob me, you take these missiles 
 Along with that, I ain't your average cat 
 Fuck rap, I'm tryin' to make CREAM and that's that 
 Whatever it takes however it gots to go down 
 Four mics on stage a motha'fuckin' four pound 
 Speakers leakin' out sound and niggaz leakin' on the ground 
 I could truly care less the God gon' get his 
 Regardless blow for blow let's find out who hit hardest 
 This rap artist used to be a - stickup artist 
 Sometimes I test myself see if I still got it 
 A live nigga stay on point never diss 
 Regard shit or forget the essence, from which I emerged 
 P is sick, so save that bullshit for the birds 
 Live up to my word, if I got beef, niggaz comin' in herds 
 We flush through your clique get purged 
 (Chorus x2: Prodigy) 
 (Verse 3: God Father Pt. III) 
 Yo, see niggaz lookin' at me 
 With evil eye, crooked eye 
 Dunn I know why 
 They despise, see we rise, kill a wise guy 
 My enterprise Cartel, we instill 
 Black steel on a hill 
 With Mobb scale, my whole fleet keep it real 
 The raw deal, to bail, destroy, conquer 
 Rarely wonder, like the sky, like thunder 
 Keep fightin', strike land like lightning 
 Increase power, solar, mind controller 
 The title holder, upsight when I'm sober 
 I stay bent, cherry eye, chocolate scent 
 Intelligent, vetern and cheddarin' 
 Mostly all time auditin', it's on again 
 Stick you with my devil horn again 
 Born again, wild hooligan 
 Pollutin' in a city near you 
 Comin' through, The Infamous Mobb nigga 
 Whatchu gon' do?

 God damn, nigga left bleeding with his head in his hands 
 Wishing that he never crossed fam 
 And but still niggas like that get left slain 
 Found days later on the ave in a can 
 We used to dance all night my main man 
 We used to give each other pounds wit da webs of our hands 
 It's a click thing, y'all niggas wouldn't understand 
 We used to get off loose cracks and bag grams 
 Hold each other down, duckin the blue van 
 The d's on the roof, plus the 6-Y cab 
 Who'd ever thought you was a snake in the grass 
 One of my stash whip and keys to my lab 
 You wanted me shot dead, some things you can't have 
 I pulled out the 8, when you almost got stabbed 
 We followed the same path, cryed and shared laughs 
 Now I can't wait, for the day to see your bloodbath 
 Plug dat, fill you up wit slugs rat take that... 
 They never think shit stank, till shit hit the fan 
 Niggas don't think shit stank, till shit hit the fan 
 They don't think shit stank, till shit hit the fan 
 Niggas don't think shit stank, till shit hit the fan

 I'm in a benz for stealth, thinkin' on plans 
 Stopped at a red light, the birds like damn 
 I saw one whisper to the other, that's him 
 That MOB nigga I think he platinum 
 Pulled to the next corner hopped out and asked them 
 If they knew directions to rhode island 
 We was in East New York, they thought I was wildin 
 It's a click thing they wouldn't understand 
 Meanwhile I looks to my left and see some niggas frownin 
 As if they was go flip now peep this 
 I'm writin shorties math on the trunk of the Six 
 The bitch wanna blow dick cause its deep dish 
 These niggas wanna twist me because of my necklace 
 I'm calm though you know I got the stash in the whip 
 I clap though, these niggas better blast very quick 
 They coming towards me, I sat in the passenger seat 
 Reached underneath, grabbed the big Fifth 
 Acting like I'm not knowing what's happenin' 
 I'm still havin' conversation with these hens 
 I'm bout to have a confratation with these mens 
 I know I'm going home wit my chain and my head 
 Y'all wont dead me, I sleep in my own bed (pop pop pop pop pop)

 Niggas don't think shit stank, till shit hit them"

 Yo... 
 Is it ill, do it need to be fixed? 
 (That shit is real Dunn; and stop talkin' like your skills don't kill) 
 Nah it's just that sometimes I feel like that 
 I can write more fouler than the last 
 (Prodigy's ""Conscience"") 
 Yo that shit is cash trust me Dunn; I'll never lead you astray 
 Take my word niggaz wanna hear how you think 
 It be that shit that you wouldn't expect to win 
 That stay playin' in they decks over and again 
 Speak your thoughts, put your all in it 
 Whatever's in your mind, spit it 
 Place your anger on the page, release tension on the tape 
 A stress verse, seem to be what they most thirst 
 Makes fake niggaz disperse, they never challenge what works 
 (Prodigy) 
 Balancin the weakness, is what I specialize in 
 Dunn you my nigga cause you keep me hype when I'm writin 
 Kept me on point in the night when it might go down 
 Keep me eyes wide in the daytime as well 
 Kept me focused on what's real and nuttin else 
 I find it healthy, to conversate with myself 
 I kick it with my delf (I kept you alive, all these years) 
 It's that inner voice you shoulda took head to and shit 
 Coulda been home instead of bleedin 
 Maybe next time you'll listen when it speaks 
 (Prodigy's ""Conscience"") 
 Yo Dunn, I got a story to tell 
 Remember last week's mission? I told you bring the gun 
 (Yeah I remember) Nah listen, without me you'd be a memory 
 I'm the one you could come to for guidance 
 Bring you home alive when you wildin 
 Kept you out of harm's way, told you when to spray 
 Told you when it's time to put it away 
 And when the cops came, you was safe 
 (Prodigy) 
 Without question, I stay aware Dunn I'm listenin 
 Everytime we speak it's real, I know your intention's 
 To make sure we both safe and livin', and breathin 
 You gets all respect from me Dunn, believe it 
 (Prodigy's ""Conscience"") 
 Yo we got kids to raise and bills to pay 
 Enemies to lay down when they stand in our way, it's only us 
 (What about the click?) Now if you die is they comin'? 
 When you shot do they feel the bullet? 
 And when you broke can they fix it? Aight then, you keep writin 
 And let me do the thinkin', I brought us this far without mistaken 
 (Nas) 
 Voices in my head from choices that I dreaded choosin' 
 Cautions I shoulda took head, lost in my weed, steady losin 
 Thug stripes, badges of honor, forces to succeed 
 Whores on they knees, fuckin' with millionaires, killers and thieves 
 I fuck until there's no feelin' where, I bust and I pee 
 I lusted cars but I suffered and my scars run deep 
 I stay to myself, one deep, pray to my God 'cause he 
 Say when it's hard get on one knee, and ask Thy for forgiveness 
 Fuck the cash, the ice, the Ferrari's 
 With two-twenty on the dash when your life ain't right 
 See niggaz smile up in your face and stick a knife in your back 
 Snakes shake your hand and got his dick up in your wife back 
 Why's it like that? It's life black, this is the game 
 The way I see it both bitches and niggaz, is the same 
 I trust myself, I can't fuck myself 
 When hoes leave and no weed I still know me, just myself 
 Fear is weakness learn from what experience teaches 
 Beware of leaches, the vampires, my secret's 
 Never follow, cause most niggaz is straight up cowards 
 Take care of my body's the temple my mind is the power"
211,Mobb Deep,hiphop,Shook Ones Part I - Original Version,"Hey, yo, to all the killers 
 And the hundred dollar billers 
 For real, niggas who ain't got no feelings 
 Check it out now 
 I got you stuck off the realness 
 We be the infamous, you heard of us 
 Official Queens bridge murderers 
 The Mobb comes equipped with warfare 
 Beware of my crime family 
 Who got 'nuff shots to share 
 For all of those who wanna profile and pose 
 Rock you in your face 
 Stab your brain with your nosebone 
 You're all alone in these streets, cousin 
 Every man for theirself in this land we be gunnin' 
 And keep them shook crews runnin' 
 Like they supposed to 
 They come around but they never come close to 
 I can see it inside your face, you're in the wrong place 
 Cowards like you just get they're whole body laced up 
 With bullet holes and such 
 Speak the wrong words man and you will get touched 
 You can put your whole army against my team and 
 I guarantee you it'll be your very last time breathin' 
 Your simple words just don't move me, you're minor, we're major 
 You all up in the game and don't deserve to be a playa 
 Don't make me have to call your name out 
 Your crew is featherweight, my gunshots'll make you levitate 
 I'm only nineteen but my mind is older 
 And when the things get for real, my warm heart turns cold 
 Another nigga deceased, another story gets told 
 It ain't nuttin' really, ay yo dun, fuck the Philly 
 So I can get my mind off these yellow backed niggas 
 Why they still alive? I don't know, go figure 
 Meanwhile back in Queens the realness is foundation 
 If I die, I couldn't choose a better location 
 When the slugs penetrate, you feel a burning sensation 
 Getting closer to God in a tight situation 
 Now, take these words home and think it through 
 Or the next rhyme I write might be about you 
 Son, they shook 
 'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks 
 Scared to death and scared to look 
 They shook 
 'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks 
 Scared to death and scared to look 
 Livin' the live that of diamonds and guns 
 There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds 
 Some of 'em get shot, locked down and turn nuns 
 Cowardly hearts end straight up shook ones, shook ones 
 He ain't a crook son, he's just a shook one 
 Throw you hands up, throw your hands up 
 Throw you hands up, throw your hands up 
 For every rhyme I write, it's 25 to life 
 Yo, it's a must the gats we trust safeguardin' my life 
 Ain't no time for hesitation 
 That only leads to incarceration 
 You don't know me, there's no relation 
 Queens bridge niggas don't play 
 I don't got time for your petty thinking mind 
 Son, I'm bigga than those 
 Claimin' that you pack heat but you're scared to hold 
 And when the smoke clears 
 You'll be left with one in your dome 
 Thirteen years in the projects, my mentality is what, kid 
 You talk a good one, but you don't want it 
 Sometimes I wonder do I deserve to live 
 Or am I going to burn in hell for all the things I did 
 No time to dwell on that cause my brain reacts 
 Front if you want kid, lay on your back 
 I don't fake jacks kid, you know I bring it to you live 
 Stay in a child's place, kid you out of line 
 Criminal minds thirsty for recognition 
 I'm sippin', E&J, got my mind flippin' 
 I'm buggin', think I'm how bizarre to hold my hustlin' 
 Get that loot kid, you know my function 
 'Cause long as I'm alive I'ma live illegal 
 And once I get on I'ma put on on my people 
 React mixed to lyrics like Macs I hit your dome up 
 When I roll up, don't be caught sleepin', 'cause I'm creepin' 
 Son, they shook 
 'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks 
 Scared to death and scared to look 
 They shook 
 'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks 
 Scared to death and scared to look 
 They shook 
 'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks 
 Scared to death and scared to look 
 They shook 
 Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks 
 Livin' the live, that of diamonds and guns 
 There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds 
 Some of 'em get shot, locked down and turn nuns 
 Cowardly hearts end straight up shook ones, shook ones 
 He ain't a crook son, he's just a shook one 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"

 Verse 1: Prodigy, A.C.D. 
 M-O-B-B D-E-E-P, A.C.D. burn sometin 
 Let's get lifted, Queens is you wit me 
 Niggas' shifty, I turn around, a kid tried to hit me 
 I back him down wit the 50-50 
 It had to been the thug in me, ya tunnel bang and come and get me 
 The first five hundred bitches free 
 He kid with the god jewel and let all my gods come through 
 Live niggas on this side of the bar, you get smacked, boo 
 And fucked too, shit on me? Well then, fuck you 
 Gone wit your high class ass if you want to 
 Outta state you be suckin me off and breakin off 
 Weed bitch stinks of stallion but my dick went soft 
 My Mobb got in lock wit Masterlock, het getcha locks picked 
 Run up in your spot, mask-n-glove shit 
 Queens niggas involved with thug shit, you get lumpded 
 Crank, we in the bathroom thumpin 
 To the three-time losers, alcohol abusers 
 Big money spenders and the Ebineezer Scroogers 
 Thugs holdin' fort wit the sixteen shot Rugers 
 The CREAM that I redeem will bring a Lex and Landcruiser 
 Dominant chapter, assassinin' the obsolete 
 And my Mobb comes Deep to put the wind beneath your feet 
 My heart's harder than concrete, and nervous streets 
 Be walked offbeat but still thugs carry heats 
 I get deeper than skin, paragraphs from within 
 Dear lord, my life is trife, please forgive for me sins 
 My kin stay my kin, ain't no room for extra friends 
 One love to my thugs up north in the pens 
 Be a prophet to raise, beat my speech on stage 
 Nemesis renegade, breakin down barricades 
 These days are gettin' rough, 'nother brother handcuffed 
 Fallen victim to the gameis like style's corrupt 
 My crime niggas livin' - street life 
 Them Queen niggas livin' - street life 
 My drug niggas livin' - street life 
 My street niggas livin' - street life 
 You thug niggas livin' - street life 
 NYC livin' - street life 
 My Mobb niggas livin' - street life 
 What? 
 Verse 2: Havoc, A.C.D. 
 For every rhyme I write, reality bites 
 My clique keeps shit rolled too tight 
 Regulate and know the rule 
 I gets some insight plus info, do stickers with my kickos 
 My .44 will burn that ass like goin' raw with nymphos 
 So protect your lifestyle, rock your vest 
 Or get your teflon put to the motherfuckin test 
 State pen put on points, son you know 
 Stay on the low, got the back, oh-no-no 
 When I'm on a dough blow, got ta guard you now 
 Kid, you wanna get foul, so now I gotta put that ass back on profile 
 Change your character, you ain't got stamina 
 Nigga get that dough, I ain't mad at'cha 
 The Infamous handle business, gonna make mines 
 Forever, son, kid you heard it through the grapevine 
 To my royal thug commitees and outlaws that live the life of Frank Nitty 
 The big city mobster, the C-to-D ???? has made the 
 God unholy, skies forever watch me 
 The prophecy, another chapter, there's no stoppin' me 
 Propagation, my life story is far from fiction 
 'Cause at one time, the .44 bullets took the world, bring sparks and friction 
 I anaylse this 'erb so I roll with trife characters 
 The hardest for the world to cap, and shiner like a 
 Full carat diamond with perfect designin 
 Philly's and 9 mili's and Coupe De Villey's forever reclinin 
 To the shoot, physicals in this paradox 
 The world is hot and my plot is to receive grands and yachts 
 Until then I be a trife individual, dwellin in these days 
 Scorch from the deeez plus the sun's rays 
 Dead President dreams and million dollar schemes 
 Killer Queens, the land of CREAM fiends 
 A.C.D. the world terrorist 
 Stainless Rugers for the intruders and my cipher's Infamous 
 Through New York and worldwide, we penetrate your inside 
 *?Diamond did?* drama, son, and 9 clips so prepare fro heaven's ride

 No doubt indeed... with that weed... know what I'm saying? 
 That old real shit... 
 (Prodigy) 
 There's a war going on outside no man is safe from 
 You can run but you can't hide forever 
 From these, streets that we done took 
 You walking with ya head down; scared to look 
 You shook, 'cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks 
 They never around when the beef cooks in my part of town 
 It's similar to Vietnam 
 Now we all grown up and old and beyond the cop's control 
 They better have the riot gear ready 
 Trying to bag me and get rocked steady 
 By the Mac One-double, I touch you 
 And leave you with not much to go home with 
 My skin is thick, 'cause I be up in a mix of action 
 If I'm not at home, puffing lye relaxing 
 New York got a nigga depressed 
 So I wear a slug-proof underneath my Guess 
 God bless my soul, before I put my foot down and begin to stroll 
 Into the drama I built, and all unfinished beef 
 You will soon be killed, put us together 
 It's like mixing vodka and milk 
 I'm going out blasting, taking my enemies with me 
 And if not, they scarred, so they will never forget me 
 Lord forgive me the Hennesey got me not knowing how to act 
 I'm falling and I can't turn back 
 Or maybe it's the words from my man Killa Black 
 That I can't say so it's left a untold fact 
 Until my death, my goal's to stay alive 
 Survival of the fit only the strong survive 
 Yo, yo 
 We living this till the day that we die 
 Survival of the fit only the strong survive (we still living it) 
 We living this till the day that we die 
 Survival of the fit only the strong survive (Thug life, we still 
 Living it)

 I'm trapped, in between two worlds, trying to make dough 
 You know when the dough get low the jewels go 
 But never that, as long as fiends smoke crack 
 I be on the block hustling counting my stacks 
 No doubt, watching my back and proceed with caution 
 Five-ohs lurking, no time to get lost in -- the system 
 Brothers used to fake names to get out quick 
 My brother did it and got bagged with two ounces 
 I live a war where squads hit the block hard 
 Ask my man Twin when he got bagged, that messed me up God 
 But things happen for a reason 
 You find out who's the true peoples when you're up north 
 Bleeding 
 You can't find a shorty to troop your bid with you 
 Hit with a 2 to 4 it's difficult 
 While on the streets I try to maintain 
 Tight with my loot, the shorties like to run game 
 Some brothers like to trick but I ain't on that tricking tip 
 I'm like a Jew, saving dough so I can big whip 
 Pushing a Lex, now I'm set, ready to jet 
 No matter how much loot I get I'm staying in the projects, 
 Forever 
 Jakes on the blocks we out-clever 
 If beef, we never separate and pull together 
 When worse comes to worst, my peoples come first 
 Try to react and word is bond, get your feelings hurt 
 My crew's all about loot, forget looking cute 
 I'm strictly Timb boots and army certified suits 
 Puffing L's, laid back, enjoying the smell 
 In the Bridge, thumping I's, it ain't hard to tell 
 You better realize 
 We living this till the day that we die 
 Survival of the fit only the strong survive (we still living it) 
 We living this till the day that we die 
 Survival of the fit only the strong survive (Thug life, we still

 And start running when my gun kicks 
 Leaving niggas dead on arrival, 
 And keeping it real is my means of survival 
 I rise to the top while you fall on your face 
 So coward-ass niggas just stay in ya place 
 I won't lie... and I don't give a fuck if I die 
 You can tell a real nigga by the look in his eye

 Mobb Deep, and we got that beef, but fuck it 
 It goess with the territory, we stuck with it 
 I admit, I didn't do it, the Glock did it

 I'm tired of these silly ass games 
 I can't even look at you no more 
 And I don't think you'll ever understand 
 Until you get a dose of your own 
 It's your turn now 
 Crazy how I never use to say a single word 
 I just held in all the hurt, all this hurt 
 And I was so afraid you might flip out 
 And leave me in the cold 
 Then my mind ran out of space 
 So many stories I'm told 
 How would you feel 
 If I put my girls before the one I love 
 How would it feel 
 If every time you want to talk 
 I turn the TV on 
 How would you feel 
 If when we're making love 
 I don't go down no more 
 So you know how I feel 
 Get ready cause a 3-6-0's about to go down 
 Taste this 
 And let's see if you can handle it 
 Just one sip 
 You probably choke on your own medicine 
 Taste that 
 Once you swallow then I got you trapped 
 No more running 
 No more hiding 
 And if you try 
 I'm still gon find ya 
 And get you back 
 Get you back 
 Listenin' to my conversations 
 On the other phone 
 Got somebody followin' me 
 When I leave out our home 
 And I am so appalled 
 You take it there 
 When you're the one who messed up 
 It's like I'm sleepin' with the enemy 
 How would you like it 
 If your girlfriend started playin' F.B.I 
 And she was the one 
 You forgave when she messed up 
 And spread her thighs 
 Plays with his brain 
 Started foolin' with ya money 
 Your house 
 Your Bens 
 Your friends 
 Your work 
 Let's see how you like it 
 And take a little taste 
 Taste of your own dirt 
 Taste this 
 And let's see if you can handle it 
 Just one sip 
 You probably choke on your own medicine

 No more running 
 No more hiding (No)

 I've got to find a remedy 
 I'm sleeping with the enemy (Yeah) 
 He doesn't know just what's in store 
 So they call me a silent storm 
 And soon he'll feel all my of pain 
 I'll come for sun after the rain (Oh) 
 Ain't nothin' sweeter than revenge 
 To put this bullshit to an end 
 Let's see what happens when I get a Lex 
 Lets see what happens if I quit my job 
 Oh 
 Let's see how you feel when I don't call back 
 You can't take it 
 No more running 
 No more hiding 
 'Cause I'm crazy 
 I'm a find you 
 And get you back 
 Get you back

 You not a man 
 If I gotta tell you how to treat me (Oh) 
 And I'm not a woman 
 If I don't stand up in what I believe in 
 Taste that 
 50/50's it's suppose to be 
 But less than 25 is what you gave me 
 No more running 
 No more hiding (Yep)

 I'm still goin' find ya (See, I'm a find you) 
 And get you back

 You hurt me 
 You hurt me so bad

 Dear mama, I'm writin' you this letter from the kitchen 
 Seems to hard, times your the only one who listens 
 After the action, tone's still listen 
 And you know how sometimes it gets lonely in prison 
 Not behind bars, but between my inner self 
 Can't trust these streets, fiends'll kill you for your wealth 
 It seems like the game done changed, niggas ain't loyal no more 
 Best friends act strange 
 Did the best I could, fed the hood 
 Went to school, showed the youth to perfect their books 
 When my niggas got locked, up to comissary stock 
 Visit every jail from Marcy to Comstock 
 Now niggas wanna plot like they movin' somethin' 
 Must wanna get shot, you ain't provin' nothin' 
 Uhn, must of forgot all the dudes I put in 
 If we only had a chance to review the footage 
 You would see I'm not a nice guy after all 
 And I fight much better when my back's to the wall 
 I clap at your door, put your backs on the floor 
 Wanna war with the Don? It' the wrath that you want! 
 (Chorus: Havoc) 
 Yo, if you feel me then feel me 
 If you gonna kill me then kill me 
 But I gotta let y'all niggas know 
 That I roll with that steel 
 You can call me paranoid 
 But a nigga on point 
 And I'm thinkin' somethin' fishy 
 If you up in my grill 
 (Remi Martin) 
 You wanna know what my life's like, bitch? 
 Mine's is real, chicks talk about it 
 I been bustin' nines for real 
 Too many times I had to stand up on the line for meals 
 Too many nights I done seen niggas die for real 
 I'm striving still, everybody lies and steals 
 It's seems like it's gotten worse since I signed my deal 
 Ask anyone who knows me, I don't give a fuck 
 That's my motto 
 These motherfuckers is actin' like I just hit the lotto 
 And now every time I see you, ""Remi where that weed at?"" 
 ""Wasn't you just pregnant, bitch, where the fuckin' seed at?"" 
 Can I hold? Let me borrow, come on, I don't need that 
 I can recall days when Remi didn't have a place to sleep at 
 Where was you back when I was sellin' cracks and 
 Barely fuckin' eatin', nigga, where was your ass then? 
 Now I'm in the cut with a blunt, nigga, laughin' 
 A Benz coup, a condo, and a check I'm steady cashin' 
 Told y'all niggas that I spaz over reflex 
 Now you niggas can't pass through the PJs 
 Fuck y'all bitches, I don't love y'all bitches 
 'Cause if it comes down to it, I'll slug y'all bitches 
 (Havoc) 
 Am I holdin' it down? 
 Afraid so, youngun 
 Not for nothin', niggas frontin' 
 When they claimin' you thuggin' 
 Raw cut him, dunn, he went against the grain 
 So fuck him, and it's real 
 He ended up with the doctors pluggin him 
 These streets raised me, and made me cold 
 When there's drama like a ducthy I come ready to roll 
 Had a passion for Henney, now I'm thuggin' with Remi 
 And Joe, give these motherfuckers somethin' to +envy+ 
 It's sad, fuckin' ?? keep the heat on the dash 
 It's simple, math, front get one in the ass 
 And you laughin', your whereabouts police be askin' 
 It baffles, cause you know these fingerprints ain't matchin' 
 Get at you, and dogg, it was about bound to happen 
 Sleep, fuck around, get your shit pushed +Deep+ 
 Bang this, where the Bloods and Crips? 
 Cause you know I'm only reppin' for that gangsta shit, get up

 Get my boogie on, and leave shells on the floor

 Niggas is left blindfolded, reminded 
 How real shit can get live at time at 
 USA, New York City if you want to be exact 
 A soldier story from Queens if you look closer on the map 
 Battalions taught me how to bust my gat 
 Mentally fuck the god, and left me to take my earth back 
 Time for revolutionary acts 
 Yo, Hav you shift the tracks, I'll find the facts 
 Now we got illuminati all on our backs 
 Check and see if we do crimes or pay tax 
 The war is on, no time to lax 
 Build an arsenal, got word back fom apostle 
 Unoriginal man got plans colossal 
 Undelay, nigga get ya shit straight 
 Fuck a pearly white gate, all that bullshit is fake 
 The only gates I'll see if they send nigga upstate 
 Never that, I'm here to show the world where my head's at 
 Forever fed, till the Aryans on they death bed 
 A rebel, I wear the universal flag symbol 
 The positive and negative war will soon kindle 
 Buckin' at the government like Terminator 2

 Yo! 
 I'm fixin' across the street, then I sees my enemy 
 This jealous muthafucka who pretends to be a friend of me 
 Said he's got static with my whole team 
 I mean, he's lookin' like he's reachin' 
 I broke into the streets and 
 Shots licked off, as I dipped off pissed off 
 Runnin' up the block till I heard no more shots 
 Now, what the fuck is gonna come of this? 
 On the strength he missed 
 He's going first on my list 
 Call up E so we can map out the plan 
 One hour later I'm gettin' herbed up in the van 
 Plan is, drive around the block and catch him sleepin' 
 The war is on kid and it won't last till the weekend 
 I'ma check around until I catch 'em 
 Out there pumpin' on the block without his weapon 
 It's only fair I get revenge, because revenge is so sweet 
 When you live the lifestyle of the street

 Word up, word up son 
 Check it out son 
 Hit 'em with the body blow

 Eh-huh, eh-huh, we don't love 'em, yeah, yo 
 (Verse 1: Prodigy) 
 Uh-huh, yeah 
 Me and shorty in the back seat chiefin' on ganja leaf 
 She ain't inspired cheek 'cause her man is weak 
 He make it real easy for me to get her for free 
 She real use to the bullshit that he be speakin' 
 She's not use to - havin' that pussy hoe beatin' 
 The bitch don't want to feel love, she want to feel sleazy 
 Bitch wanna have fun, yo ass is dough 
 That's why she ride with us to all the weekend shows 
 When I have first met the hoe, she was real timid 
 She ain't know if it was aiight for her to live it 
 DAMN! look at her now, with many Pastel, Polo skirts 
 You see it all when she sit down 
 She keep it real easy for me to be in and out 
 All I gotta do is open 'em legs and bang it out 
 Without the struggle, or gettin' them panties off 
 Fuck her like I'm tryin' to kill her 
 Then I tell her ""get lost"" 
 (Chorus: Havoc) 
 Love them hoes, we don't love them (Nope) 
 Love them hoes, we don't love them (Nope) 
 Love them hoes, we don't love them (No) 
 Love them hoes, we don't love them (Uh-huh) 
 Love them hoes, we don't love them (No) 
 Love them hoes, we don't love them (No) 
 Love them hoes, we don't love them (No) 
 (Interlude: Havoc) 
 Damn! baby, how you call yourself a Pimp? 
 Let, let me understand somethin' 
 How you gon' be a Pimp, and get Pimped 
 That shit don't make sense to me man 
 You lettin' them bitches all up on your pocket man 
 You should be ashamed of yourself 
 (Verse 2: Havoc) 
 Some think it's cool in the game and handcuff a bro', homey you wrong 
 Fuck you think she walk around with the matchin' pair of thongs 
 Tooth brush and the purse, the hoe works 
 Shorty gained at your cribs, she at work 
 Master of the toe curl, shorty got it down to a science 
 Placin' body enough to start, damn right 
 Nigga like me just bang her out, and bangin' her friend 
 Soon enough it'll be a family event 
 Know the hipno', havin' them bent, sneakin' up 
 You ain't the only one beatin' her up 
 Real reason why she fucks with you 'cause you be lightin' her up 
 To her it's like paper trainin' to puff 
 Do she suck you?, fuck you?, make you feel like a man? 
 You gettin' that good lovin' and bitin' your own hand 
 Yo you just another fool, hopeless, tryin' to lock her 
 She got your ass comin' out the pockets uh? 
 (Outro: Havoc w/ conversation) 
 Ay Ma, how you doin'? 
 Still, what you doin'? 
 True, chillin', you know me up in the studio doin' my thing 
 Yeah, yeah, you need what?, what the fuck you talkin' about 
 You need some, you better ask your baby father for that shit 
 You crazy, damn baby 
 (Chorus: Havoc) 
 Love them hoes, we don't love them 
 Love them hoes, we don't love them 
 Love them hoes, we don't love them 
 Love them hoes, we don't love them (Uh-huh) 
 Love them hoes, we don't love them 
 Love them hoes, we don't love them 
 Love them hoes, we don't love them"

 Ready for war, Ready for anything 
 But Doing this for everything 
 Y'all niggers Know my pedegree 
 Fourty first side, blood run through my veins 
 Got everything in game 
 Like to stock and change 
 Got shorti in the hood on the ankle rockin' my name 
 Words that I spit, It's my brain and pipe game 
 Call me your natural right ring 
 Qb's radaiclas, just doing his thing 
 Aiyo, niggas hate it 
 Even though they try to protray it 
 This money looking good, fuck it you can all hate it 
 Like I'm going to lose sleep, hold life, have beef 
 So you can say what you think about me 
 Yo you niggas like Nas and gun fight your dead roon 
 Pull out the nine and still got hooked on 
 Your no frill skim 
 And on skill team 
 Got you in a combma 
 Angel of your shoulder 
 Aiyo we live this eat, sleep, shit this (repeat 7X) 
 We live this, live this, this... 
 (Big Noyd) 
 Aiyo, Aiyo, Aiyo 
 Its alyways Going to be gangster with me 
 Nigga, with Tim's on my feet 
 Either sweats or denim jeans, brand new white tee 
 With my chain swinging; I'm thugged in the streets 
 Think Noyd you think hustling busting the heat 
 Repping Qb borrows surrounded with thugs 
 Who carry coke, crack, bud and they got guns 
 Who want from slums to homes; Trains to the V's 
 The niggas you see in the hood with the G's 
 Where gangstas be and the pistols pop 
 You rub on the mama thighs they panties drop 
 This shit get you hot 
 We ill you not 
 You sick because you love the way we rock 
 Crusing in the Nav with a dime or not 
 Jumping out the Nav copping cheese but eye up the spot 
 You know my two heaters is hot 
 Fending for springing 
 And that goes out to those skimming and laying 
 (Roxanne Shante) 
 Who you know have guity fo's and a dime ass kooci 
 Now thugging and recovering, rocking guns and gucci 
 85' getting paid while them gangsters watch 
 Champiagn pop benzes candy painted drop (bitch) 
 Roxanne Shante Hilary Clinton 
 Lay out the red carpet y'all hoes shut up and listen 
 Mouth close whenever you hear a veteran spittin' 
 Y'all hoes only shine with the legends permisson 
 Bitches ask around why she wait to spit this long 
 You know the queen who came out with the first hit song 
 I showed hoes how to rock furs 
 Glocks in my skirts 
 Dated real killers when they feel I cop them a bird 
 Ain't nothing 
 Ain't fronting 
 Shantie love where she lives 
 Mother of my two kids 
 And the mother of the rich 
 Tried to make plans, ran the game and the biz 
 Still real popping up with nas up at the bridge 
 No silcone, No wigs, No liposuchion 
 First bitch riding back sike not fronting 
 I respect new females give all y'all credit 
 Supporting your videos bought all y'all records 
 No matter how you get down you sexual prefence 
 Just keep this shit real or that vet going to set it 
 Queensbrigde projects we murder the rest 
 And all my gangers know I rock the best"

 Uh-huh, yeah 
 Yeah, when you hear the 
 Yeah 
 P yeah, you heard of him, big ignorant chains and sports cars 
 Gallons of Bacardi, been at the awards 
 I need a bitch like Christina Aguilera for a broad 
 I know I can splack that, she dyin' for a thug 
 And she heard of me, she know about my Infamous life 
 Shootouts in New York with various types 
 Fast money, faster guns, we party e'ry night 
 'Cause we perform, e'ry day of the week for that price 
 Who you know got a similar catalogue 
 And still sound brand new, like we just started? 
 The Carhatt Mobb, Guess jean team 
 Forty inch chain gang, volume please 
 So these people can hear the sounds of Queens 
 I make your arm hairs stand up, it had to be me 
 Mixed with the A L C and H A V 
 N.Y.C. to L.A., we do our swing 
 E'rybody have a ball, e'rybody party 
 E'rywhere you turn it ain't nuttin' but phatties and hotties 
 E'rything is all love 'til you try to try me 
 That's when I make e'rybody 
 When you hear the, it's on 
 When you hear the, it's on 
 When you hear that, it's on 
 When you hear that, it's on 
 Yo I'ma glow, like a dirty bomb, jux, with the certy arm 
 Rippin' anything, that you motherfuckin' hear me on 
 Add it to the catalogue, heavy hitters had the song 
 Niggaz showin' no feelings and me, got 'em camoflauged 
 You little babies so emotional 
 And tip-toe around the beef until that toast to you 
 Ain't got no problem in smokin' you 
 Enemies I could deal with, be the ones that's close to you 
 And do, what I'm 'posed to do, approach Duke 
 Why you fagots only squeezin' from out, the vocal booth? 
 Know my style be that over proof, open the Coupe 
 Open your face was talkin', wasn't talkin' to you 
 And now the medics gotta mind to your face, tyin' the lace 
 You tellin' that a D.A. got 'em tryin' the case, yeah 
 Bottom line you cowards is ass 
 Know Mobb good in numbers y'all music is trash 
 When you hear the 
 When you hear the, it's on 
 When you hear the, it's on 
 When you hear the, it's on 
 When you hear the"
227,Mobb Deep,hiphop,Win Or Lose (Remix),"(Havoc) 
 It's real, yeah, right, oh, uh, it's right, oh yeah, whoo 
 Feel it baby, yes 
 Another day another dolla, it's about gettin' money 
 Then you can gimme a holla, my nose runny 
 I've been out in the cold, hustlin for so long, my hands numb 
 But bet I feel that paper hit my palm 
 (Nas) 
 My stripes show like regimines, military intelligence 
 Murder game, I leave no evidence, credentials 
 Go ask my preschool, even talk to my old principal 
 He tell you how I used to pack a number two pencil 
 (Prodigy) 
 It's like ah shit it's on, time to go shoppin' 
 For cars not fashion, my whips be the bomb 
 My clothes, be the same shit that we had on 
 Fuck lookin' cute save that for the broads 
 (Jay-Z) 
 Ya brought to the game, all the scores the adrenaline rush 
 Your blug-boys not knowin' cops could rush 
 And you in a drop, you so easy to touch 
 No two days are alike, except the first and fifteenth pretty much 
 (Havoc) 
 It's the H-A-V-O, C dump and reload 
 Knock knock answer that I'm blastin through the peep hole 
 Body charge, pay lawyers so we get those 
 Get locked then I'm sluttin lady CO's 
 (Prodigy) 
 We be the only niggaz you know that fuck they PO's 
 They push our files to the top, you still on peroll 
 We got, money to roll, no time for pennetentiaries 
 Too much dollars to fold, it's bulgin out our jeans 
 Here I go again, whether I win or lose 
 But losin ain't a option girl 
 My destination is top of the world (top of the world) 
 (Havoc) 
 Y'all like bitches, the chit chatterin 
 Stay not likin a nigga, but givin' dap to him 
 Hav don't change for no chick, and they adapt to 'em 
 Never get cool with you niggaz I end up clappin 'em 
 (Jadakiss) 
 Ey yo my attitude is subject to change 
 I mess around and spit twelve with the drivers side doin' ya range 
 Six hit you, the other six up in ya dame 
 Mafia style, leave you with your watch and your change 
 (Prodigy) 
 Federal note fettish, you fuck with my niggaz Franklin and Grant 
 Get yo ass blammed with the quickness 
 Ya niggaz is finished, you overdosin the world with that cute shit 
 It's time for this realness 
 (Jay-Z) 
 And trust, is a word you seldom hear from us 
 Hustlers, we don't sleep, we rest one eye up 
 And the droppin' to find a man, when the well dries up 
 You learn to work the water, without work, you thirst 'fore you die yup! 
 (Jadakiss) 
 So take heat, that not only can I flow I can aim 
 Cause y'all misdemeanin niggaz can't stand the rain 
 Better believe that, whenever I see y'all, I'mma test ya 
 Only 'cause I know the fact that you respect pressure 
 (Havoc) 
 And here I go again, lettin the mack blow 
 Slugs bubble up in ya stomach like lactose 
 I'mma date shorty put it up in her backbone 
 For real, put it on it like a check, though my rap don't 
 (Nas) 
 Tables turned now, got my own label I earned 
 Like that nigga said in Dead Presidents, ""Money to burn"" 
 Queensbridge paid homage respect 
 Nas is a vadic, knowledge to rap 
 Plotters with gats, niggaz is dissin that 
 (Jay-Z) 
 Now all the teachers couldn't reach me 
 And my mamma couldn't beat me hard enough 
 To match the pain of my pop not seein me, so 
 With that stain in my membrane 
 Got on my pimp game, fuck the world, my defense came 
 Then that 'halin introduced me to the game 
 Spanish Jose introduced me to Cam' 
 I'm a hustler now, my gear is in and I'm in the in-crowd 
 And all the way be light scream girls be lovin' me now 
 (Prodigy) 
 We out-live labels, and distributors 
 We run laps around e'rybody artist on ya pay-roll 
 To hop up in the Range Rove 
 Jet black with the black rims killin' yo bitch in the A hole, uh oh 
 (Chorus- till end)"

230,Mobb Deep,hiphop,Young Luv,"Fresh out this bitch pussy 
 Hay in the middle of the barn don 
 Super hoe puttin' on the freak show 
 Inside the mini mansion had bitches dancin 
 And the naked bitch you ain't ready 
 My dick is 2 percent head 
 98 percent shaft heavy 
 Steadily long strokin shit 
 P stands for penetration 
 While y'all parlaying 
 I'm in the back 
 Diggin her back while shorty hollerin 
 Candy girl 
 Took a blast of the shit 
 I got her in the pretzel 
 Pushin her legs back she wet too 
 Perverted niggas do this type of shit all day 
 Sodomize modernize em 
 Up to my standards 
 1996 bitches got ran through 
 1997 cancel that hoe 
 She blessed the God well though 
 Word Up son you know what I'm sayin' 
 You know how that go though 
 Caligula style young love 
 Model actress 
 Superstar porno star on the mattress 
 Lookin' like Jada Pinkett 
 I stabbed it 
 The vultures grabbed it 
 Money No date raped it 
 Videotaped it 
 Handy Cam Record 
 The bitch is blowin' me 
 My dick went soft 
 Young Luv 
 Scrubbin that crotch with Dove 
 Potpourri bitches get fucked and mouth plugged 
 So lady cop, secretaries and librarians 
 Midtown high class hoe with pearl earrings 
 Bump into a true to life vulture like me 
 Beat you over the head with G 
 Drag you back to the cage 
 And let this mobb nigga coach boo 
 Train that ass 
 Put it on curfew 
 Hey Young Luv 
 Young Luv Young Luv 
 Left it in the hotel 
 Must have been we don't love em 
 Before you consider it foul 
 Let me put you on cousin 
 88 had a vision on some rap shit 
 Not knowin' it would happen 
 Down the road gold status 
 But back then 
 There was this one little chick 
 That I wanted to hit get with 
 The whole shit 
 14 layin my G 
 Little me 
 I had to have her 
 Had a nigga like me losin Zs 
 No Sleep 
 Fucked up in the head over her physique 
 Even thought about goin' downtown 
 I know there's niggas out there that would have felt the same way 
 It was the freak in me 
 Actually crossed my mind frequently 
 Finally and once again 
 We bumped heads 
 A stank gesture 
 Suggested that I was dead like a crackhead 
 Didn't even give a nigga real 
 But fuck it 
 What can I say 
 I tried to put my little bid and kept livin' 
 Nigga move on 
 You a man 
 No matter what it take we're gonna hold the upper hand 
 Shufflin beats 
 Six years later son it was done 
 The Infamous Mobb Deep 
 Left you stuck off the Shook Ones 
 And then funniest thing after a show backstage 
 I peeped chick 
 Who didn't give me play back in the day 
 It was all love 
 Hold no grudge gave her a hug 
 What's the drilly baby 
 She was like you 
 Nah what's up 
 You know me 
 Doin' my thing tryin' to live 
 Asked if I was busy could I chill with her in her crib 
 No days 
 But we can chill up in the Ramada 
 Payback is a bitch 
 Once I get it there I got her in the telly 
 E&J dick popped the cherry 
 Left the little hoe with no dough and got jetty 
 Bless the God boo 
 You know how we do 
 It's self explainable 
 Undomesticatable 
 But highly we capable 
 The turntables beat you in your own game 
 Enough said 
 Another victim caught up in fame's web 
 Young Luv Young Luv"
