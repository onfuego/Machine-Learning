 Spot him, got him, as I pulls out my strap 
 Got my chrome to the side of his White Sox hat

 Bodies bein' found on Greenleaf 
 With their fucking heads cut off, motherfucker, I'm Dre 
 So listen to the play-by-play, day-by-day 
 Rollin' in my '4 with sixteen switches 
 And got sounds for the bitches 
 Cockin' all the riches, got the hollow points for the snitches 
 So would you just walk on by 'cause I'm too hard to lift 
 And no, this ain't Aerosmith 
 It's the motherfuckin' D-R-E from the C-P-T 
 On a ryhmin' spree, a straight G 
 Hop back as I pop my top, ya trip 
 I let the hollow points commence to pop, pop, pop 
 Yeah, 'cause if it don't stop, I have to put my shit in reverse 
 Go back and take another stop 'cause I'm

 George Clinton and Dr. Dre:

 Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (With all the niggas sayin') 
 Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (Hell yeah) 
 Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (Hell yeah) 
 Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg: 
 Just another motherfuckin' day for Dre so I begin like this 
 No medallions, dreadlocks, or black fists 
 It's just that gangsta glare with gangsta raps 
 That gangsta shit makes a gang of snaps 
 Word to the motherfuckin' streets 
 And word to these hyped-ass lyrics and dope beats 
 That I hit ya with, that I get ya with 
 As I groove in my '4 on D's, hittin' the switches 
 Bitches relax while I get my proper swerve on 
 Bumping like a motherfucker ready to get my serve on 
 But before I hit the dope spot 
 Gotta get the chronic, the Remy Martin, and my soda pop 
 Now I'm smelling like Indonesia 
 Bus stop full of fly bitches and skeezers 
 On my dick 'cause my '4 on hit 
 Pancake, front and back, side to side, and all that shit 
 So when I crawl, I comes correct 
 Now if your bitch in my shit, it's your bitch you check, nigga 
 Now let the Chevrolet slide 
 As I dip, a nigga trip to the south side, yeah 
 (Rollin' in my '64) with all the bitches sayin' 
 George Clinton and Dr. Dre: 
 Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (Hell yeah) 
 Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (With all the motherfuckin' bitches sayin') 
 Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (You know what I'm sayin'?) 
 Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride 
 Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg: 
 Check this out, the sun went down when I hit Slauson 
 On my way to the strip, now I'm just flossin' 
 Checkin' my rearview 'cause niggas they will do 
 Jack moves, black fools 'cause I smack fools 
 Try to set me up for a 211 
 Fuck around and get caught up in a 187 
 But I don't represent no gangbang 
 Some niggas like lynchin' but I just watch 'em hang 
 So on and so on, why don't you let me roll on? 
 I remember back in the days when I used to have to get my stroll on 
 Didn't nobody wanna speak 
 Now everybody peepin' out they window when they hear me beatin' up the street 
 ""Is it Dre? Is it Dre?"" that's what they say 
 Every single motherfuckin' day 
 Yo, but I ain't trippin', I'm just kickin' it 
 While my D's keep spinnin' and these hoes keep grinnin', I be 
 (Rollin' in my '64) with everybody sayin' 
 George Clinton and Dr. Dre: 
 Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (Hell yeah) 
 Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (With everybody sayin') 
 Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (Hell yeah) 
 Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride

 Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride"
3,Dr. Dre,hiphop,The Day The Niggaz Took Over,"I'mma say this and I'mma end mine 
 If you ain't down for the Africans here in the United States, period point blank 
 If you ain't down for the ones that suffer in South Africa from apartheid and shit 
 Devil you need to step your punk ass to the side and let us brothers and us Africans step in and start puttin' some funk in that ass 
 Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin' 
 Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin' 
 Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin' 
 Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin' 
 Snoop Dogg: 
 I got my finger on the trigger so niggas wonder why 
 But livin' in the city it's do-or-die 
 I got my finger on the trigger so niggas wonder why 
 But livin' in the city it's do-or-die 
 Daz Dillinger: 
 Them wonder why me violent and no really understand 
 For the reason why me take me law in me own hand 
 Me not out for peace and me not Rodney King 
 The gun goes click, me gun goes bang 
 Them riot in Compton and them riot in Long Beach 
 Them riot in LA 'cause them no really wanna see 
 Niggas start to loot and police start to shoot 
 Lock us down at seven o'clock, barricades us like Beirut 
 Me don't show no love 'cause it's us against them 
 Them never ever love me 'cause it's sport to break them 
 And kill, at my own risk, if I may 
 To lay, to spray, with my AK, and put it to rest 
 Yes we have 
 There have been riots, ah uh, rioting 
 Well I don't wanna say rioting, but there's been looting downtown 
 But right now Bree, what I want to show you is, they have started fires down at the end of the street 
 Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and KRS-One: 
 How many niggas are ready to loot? 
 (Yeah, so what you wanna do?) What you wanna do? 
 I said how many niggas are ready to loot? 
 (Got myself an Uzi and my brother a nine) 
 What they told us today, in other words, you're still a slave 
 No matter how much money you got, you still ain't shit 
 Dr. Dre and Daz Dillinger: 
 Sitting in my living room, calm and collected 
 Feeling that gotta-get-mine perspective 
 'Cause what I just heard, broke me in half 
 And half the niggas I know, plus the niggas on the Row is bailing 
 Laugh now but cry much later 
 You see when niggas get together, they get mad 'cause they can't fade us 
 Like my niggas from South Central, Los Angeles 
 They found that they couldn't handle us 
 Bloods, Crips on the same squad 
 With the ese's help and, nigga it's time to rob and mob 
 (And break the white man off something lovely 
 I don't love them so them can't love me) 
 Yo, straight puttin' it down, gettin' my scoot on 
 It's jumping off in Compton so I gots to get my loot on 
 And come up on me some furniture or somethin' 
 Got a VCR in the back of my car 
 That I ganked from the Slauson Swap Meet 
 And motherfuckers better not try to stop me 
 'Cause they will see that I can't be stopped 
 'Cause I'mma cock my glock and pop till they all drop 
 (There has been videotape and you can see of the, ah, some of the crowd throwing things at the officers) 
 And swinging at them as well 
 Like there was a young woman there 
 You see she took a swing at an officer with some object in her hand 
 Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and KRS-One: 
 How many niggas are ready to loot? 
 (Yeah, so what you wanna do?) What you wanna do? 
 I said how many niggas are ready to loot? 
 (Got myself an Uzi and my brother a nine) 
 RBX: 
 I got my finger on the trigger so niggas wonder why 
 But livin' in the city it's do-or-die 
 I got my finger on the trigger so niggas wonder why 
 But livin' in the city it's do-or-die 
 One-time trigger happy, no nigga love 
 One-eighty-seven time, time to grab the glove 
 Can't get prints on a nine I throw away 
 Or get prints on my Uzi when it spray 
 Pop, pop, pop, another motherfucker drop 
 And I get relief like, plop, plop, fizz 
 Smash, I crashed his head like a window 
 I ain't Nintendo, I'm high off the indo 
 Creepin', with the quickness to the cut 
 Bust one to his head while he munches on a donut 
 And crack-up, so now he best to back up 
 I guess I gots to pack up, filling the clip up 
 I zip up-town but motherfuckin' cops are all around 
 Helicopters flyin', these motherfuckers tryin' 
 To catch me and stretch me on Death Row 
 But hell no, suppose black refuse to go 
 This is now covering a very, very wide area of Los Angeles where these fires have been, ah, ignited 
 I mean, from here to the, ah, to the south end of South Central is a long way 
 Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin' 
 Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin' 
 Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin' 
 Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin' 
 Daz Dillinger: 
 The outcome of this is destruction so them all fall 
 Niggas don't give a fuck, so them bust and them fall 
 The description of three blacks 
 Shows no justice, so, pick up it's your right 
 If you riot again, me turn the other cheek 
 We be too many, me got me nine to my side 
 So me bust, flick, 'cause he don't give a fuck and me don't give a fuck 
 And all my problems end with that buck, buck 
 Snoop Dogg: 
 Blam, blam, blam to till them fall 
 Listen to the shots from my nigga Doggy Dogg, biddy-bye 
 Dr. Dre, him bust gunshots 
 Diggidy Daz and RBX them bust gunshots, come again"
4,Dr. Dre,hiphop,Nuthin' But A 'G' Thang,"Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre: 
 One, two, three, and to the four 
 Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the door 
 Ready to make an entrance so back on up 
 ('Cause you know we're about to rip shit up) 
 Give me the microphone first so I can bust like a bubble 
 Compton and Long Beach together, now you know you in trouble 
 Ain't nothing but a G thang, baby 
 Two loc'ed out niggas so we're crazy 
 Death Row is the label that pays me 
 Unfadeable so please don't try to fade this (Hell yeah) 
 But um, back to the lecture at hand 
 Perfection is perfected so I'mma let 'em understand 
 From a young G's perspective 
 And before me dig out a bitch, I have to find a contraceptive 
 You never know, she could be earning her man 
 And learning her man and at the same time burning her man 
 Now you know I ain't with that shit, Lieutenant 
 Ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it (Yeah) 
 And that's realer than Real-Deal Holyfield 
 And now you hookers and hoes know how I feel 
 Well, if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk 
 I'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff 
 Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg: 
 It's like this and like that and like this and uh 
 It's like that and like this and like that and uh 
 It's like this and like that and like this and uh 
 (Dre, creep to the mic like a phantom) 
 Dr. Dre: 
 Well I'm peeping and I'm creeping and I'm creep-in 
 But I damn near got caught, 'cause my beeper kept beeping 
 Now it's time for me to make my impression felt 
 So sit back, relax and strap on your seat belt 
 You never been on a ride like this before 
 With a producer who can rap and control the maestro 
 At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick 
 You know and I know, I flow some old funky shit 
 To add to my collection, the selection symbolizes dope 
 Take a toke but don't choke 
 If you do, you'll have no clue 
 On what me and my homie Snoop Dogg came to do 
 Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg: 
 It's like this and like that and like this and uh 
 It's like that and like this and like that and uh 
 It's like this and who gives a fuck about those? 
 (So just chill till the next episode) 
 Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre: 
 Falling back on that ass with a hellafied gangsta lean 
 Getting funky on the mic like a old batch of collard greens 
 It's the capital S, oh yes I'm fresh, N-double O-P 
 D-O-double G-Y, D-O-double G, ya see 
 Showing much flex when it's time to wreck a mic 
 Pimping hoes and clocking a grip like my name was Dolomite 
 Yeah, and it don't quit 
 I think they in the mood for some motherfuckin' G shit (Hell yeah) 
 So Dre (What up Dogg?) 
 Gotta give them what they want (What's that, G?) 
 We gotta break 'em off something (Hell yeah) 
 And it's gotta be bumping, city of Compton 
 Dr. Dre: 
 Is where it takes place so when asked, your attention 
 Mobbing like a motherfucker but I ain't lynching 
 Dropping the funky shit that's making the sucker niggas mumble 
 When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie, they all crumble 
 Try to get close, and your ass'll get smacked 
 My motherfuckin' homie Doggy Dogg has got my back 
 Never let me slip 'cause if I slip then I'm slipping 
 But if I got my Nina then you know I'm straight tripping 
 And I'mma continue to put the rap down, put the mack down 
 And if you bitches talk shit, I'll have to put the smack down 
 Yeah and you don't stop 
 I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock 
 But I'm never off, always on to the break of dawn 
 C-O-M-P-T-O-N and the city they call Long Beach 
 Putting the shit together 
 Like my nigga D.O.C., no one can do it better 
 Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg: 
 Like this, that, this and uh 
 It's like that and like this and like that and uh 
 It's like this and who gives a fuck about those?

 Hey, I'mma tell you right now, if-if if I have to die today, for this little African right here, to have a future I'm a dead motherfucker (You right) 
 Snoop Dogg: 
 Wake up, jumped out my bed 
 I'm in a two man cell with my homie Lil 1/2 Dead 
 Murder was the case that they gave me 
 Dear God, I wonder can you save me 
 I'm only eighteen, so I'm a young buck 
 It's a riot, if I don't scrap, I'm getting stuck 
 But that's the life of a G, I guess 
 Ese's way deep, shanked two in the chest 
 Bests run 'cause brothers is dropping quicker 
 Ugh, too late, damn, down goes another nigga 
 Bouncin' off the walls, throwin' them dogs 
 Gettin' a rep as a young hog 
 It ain't nothin' like the street life 
 You better be strapped with yo' shank 'cause ain't no fist fight 
 So I guess I gots ta handle mine 
 Since I did the crime, I gots to do my time 
 Daz Dillinger and Donny Hathaway: 
 Them say me grow up to be nothin', look at me now and tell me what you see 
 I am what I am, it's only me

 What you gonna do when you grow up and have to face responsibility?) 
 Dr. Dre: 
 Now, I'm holdin' a dub, sitting on swoll 
 Twenty-seven years old, off on parole, stroll 
 I'm back up on my feet with my mind on the money 
 That I'll be making as soon as I touch the streets 
 Things done changed on this side 
 Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right 
 But it ain't no thing to me 
 'Cause now I'm what they call a loced-assed OG 
 The little homies from the hood with grip 
 Are the ones I get with 'cause I'm down to set trip 
 Nigga, I'm bigger than you, so whatchu wanna do 
 Didn't know he had a .22 
 Straight sitting behind his back 
 I grabbed his pockets and then I heard six caps 
 I fell to the ground with blood on my hands, I didn't understand 
 How a nigga so young could bust a cap 
 I used to be the same way back 
 I guess that's what I get (For what?) 
 For trying to jack them little homies for they grip 
 Daz Dillinger and Donny Hathaway: 
 Me learn many things from what me on the street 
 The outcome of what I've come to be 
 (Little ghetto boy playing in the ghetto streets 
 Whatchu gonna do when you grow up and have to face responsibility?) 
 Snoop Dogg: 
 Something for the real OG's to get with 
 Some facts, made our made, now you wanna run and play 
 Like every single day, really doe 
 You know me, I'm the smooth macadamien, gaming them for my homie 
 No need to be uncalm if you pack right 
 And learning just enuff to keep your sack right 
 Late nights, I wonder what they getting fo' 
 Early morning on the corners, what they hitting fo' 
 Seven young G's but they serve down 
 In a G ride, east side where they swerve now 
 Not thinking about what's really going on 
 Got crept on, stepped on, now they gone 
 I spent four years in the county with nothing but convicts around me 
 But now I'm back at the pound 
 And we expose ways for the youth to survive 
 Some think it's wrong but we tend to think it's right 
 So make all them ends you can make 
 'Cause when you're broke, you break, check it out 
 So ain't no need for your mama to trip 
 'Cause you's a hustling ass youngsta, clocking your grip 
 Daz Dillinger and Donny Hathaway: 
 Now me finally grown as you can see, still an OG 
 For life and always remain to be 
 (Little ghetto boy playing in the ghetto streets 
 What you gonna do when you grow up and have to face responsibility?)"
7,Dr. Dre,hiphop,A Nigga Witta Gun,"Yeah nigga, what's up with all that motherfucking shit you was talking nigga? 
 (Hey Dre, why you trip me, why you trip me?)

 Dr. Dre: 
 Forty-four reasons come to mind 
 Why your motherfucking brothers' hard to find 
 He be walking on the streets and fucking with mine 
 Stupid punk can't fuck with a mastermind 
 See I never take a step on a Compton block 
 Or LA without the AK ready to pop 
 'Cause them punk motherfuckers in black and white 
 Ain't the only motherfuckers I gots to fight 
 I thinks it's better to be telling the facts than cuffed up 
 And jacked and fucked up 
 What you niggas looking at? You going 
 ""Goddamn,"" 'cause it's the city 
 And for you to survive a nigga gotta be a gangsta 
 And I'm a nigga you can't remove 
 Took out a lot of motherfuckers for tryin' to prove 
 To their homies that they can hang by dealing with me 
 But once again in the end they D-E-A-D 
 I never did time on a murder yet 
 'Cause I relax, sit back, do a job and jet 
 Yo, I know you understand my flow 
 So here we go with Death Row, come let a motherfucker know

 Adapts to anything environment that I'm located at 
 If you see me on the solo move believe that I'm strapped 
 4-4, .tre-8 or AK-47 
 'Cause slowly but surely send you on a stairway to heaven 
 Just put my finger on the trigger and pull back 
 And lay a punk motherfucker flat

 I breaks 'em off, I breaks 'em off yeah 
 I breaks 'em off, I breaks 'em off yeah 
 I breaks 'em off but I ain't speaking about between the thighs 
 I'm talking about cocking a gauge in between your eyes 
 That'll make you drop to your knees 'cause you realize 
 That a gat will make any nigga civilized 
 Old buster-ass nigga talkin' bullshit 
 Don't know that I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with 
 Get lit or hit up by the doctor 
 A nigga that breaks 'em off properly 
 Real G so don't doubt it 
 I'm the one who's doing it while these other niggas talk about it 
 And if motherfuckers come at me wrong 
 I straight put my .44 Desert Eagle to his motherfucking dome 
 And show him why they call me the notorious one 
 The name's Dre Eastwood when I'm packing a gun 
 You don't believe me, well step up and give it a try 
 And if you die you's a buster 'cause real niggas don't die 
 But some still don't hear me though 
 You're too near me not to hear me, nigga yo so now you know

13,Dr. Dre,hiphop,Stranded On Death Row,"Artist: Dr. Dre featuring Kurupt and Rage and RBX and Snoop Dogg 
 Song: Stranded On Death Row 
 Album: The Chronic 
 Intro: Bushwick Bill 
 Yes, it is I says me 
 And although agree are more than 3 'cause they're we 
 *Laughter* 
 Yes, yo! I'm in the house now for sure 
 Because I wanna talk about the hearts of men 
 Who knows what evil lurks within' them 
 But let's take a travel down the blindside 
 And see what we find on this... 
 Path... 
 Called... 
 Verse 1: Kurupt 
 Stranded On Death Row, so duck when I swing my shit 
 I get rugged like Rawhead Rex with fat tracks that fits 
 The gangsta type, what I recite's kinda lethal 
 Niggas know, the flow that I kick, there's no equal 
 I'm murderin' niggas, Yo and maybe because of the tone 
 I kicks when I grip the mic and kick shit 
 Niggas can't fuck with 
 So remember I go hardcore and slam 
 Nuff respect like a sensei, ba-bash like Van Damme 
 So any nigga that claim they bossin 
 What don't you bring your ass on over to Crenshaw and Slauson 
 Take a walk through the hood when we up to no good 
 Slangin' them things like a real O.G. should 
 I'm stackin' and mackin' and packin' a 10 so 
 When your slippin' I slip the clip in 
 But ain't no set trippin' 
 'Cause it's Death Row, rollin' like the mafia 
 Think about whippin' some ass, but what the fuck stoppin' ya 
 Ain't nathin' but a buster 
 I'm Stranded On Death Row for pumpin' slugs in muthafuckers 
 Now you know your outdone 
 Feel the shotgun, Kurupt inmate, cell block one. 
 Verse 2: RBX 
 No prevention from this mention of sorts 
 You're a victim, from my driveby of thoughts 
 No extensions, all attempts are to fail 
 Blinded by the light, it's time you learn braile 
 From the lunatic, I death like arsenic 
 When I kick up wicked raps 
 Dr. Dre will kick the scratch 
 With treachery, my literary form will blast 
 And totally surpass the norm 
 Not a storm, plural, make it, many storms 
 When I'm vexed, I fly leg necks and arms 
 In this dimension, I'm the presenter 
 And the inventor and the tormentor 
 Deranged, like the hillside strangler 
 MC mangler, tough like Wrangler 
 I write a rhyme, hard as concrete 
 Step to the heat and get burned like mesquite. 
 So what you wanna do? 
 The narrator RBX, cell block 2. 
 Verse 3: Rage 
 Rage, lyrical murderer 
 Stranded On Death Row 
 And now I'm servin' a lifetime sentence 
 There'll be no repentance 
 Since it's the life that I choose to lead 
 I plead guilty 
 On all counts let the ball bounce where it may 
 It's just another clip into my AK 
 Buck 'em down with my underground tactics 
 Facts and stacks of clips on my mattress 
 Bed frame there's another dead pain 
 Layin' lain' with the shame, who's to blame 
 Me, the lady of Rage 
 On when I'm comin' from the D E A T H in 
 R O W takin' no shit 
 So flip and your bound to get dropped 
 It's 187 on muthafuckers don't stop 
 Handcuffed as I bust there'll be no debate 
 It's Rage, from cell block 8. 
 Verse 4: Snoop Dogg 
 And yo' steppin' through the fog 
 And creepin' through the smog 
 It's the #1 nigga from the hood, Doggy Dogg 
 Makin' videos, now I stay in Hollywood 
 Bustin' raps for my snaps now they call me Eastwood 
 Dre is the doctor and my homey little nigga 
 Warren G is my hand and my hand's on the trigga 
 Shootin' at the hoes with the game that I got 
 Sent to Death Row 'cause I wanted to make a grip from servin' my rocks 
 And I'm still, servin' for mines, peace 
 To my muthafuckin' homies doin' time 
 In the pen and the county jail 
 Mobbin' with your blues on, mad as hell 
 And you say yeah fuck the police 
 And all the homies on the streets is all about peace 
 And it's drivin' the cops crazy 
 But ain't nuttin' but a black thing bay-bee, uh 
 No I'm not flaggin' but I'm just saggin' 
 I betcha don't wanna see the D O double G 
 And you can't see the D R to the E 
 Or my muthafuckin' homey D.O.C. 
 You know you can't fuck with my muthafuckin' DJ 
 That's my homey and we call him Warren G 
 Yeah and you don't stop 
 Doggy Dogg break 'em down with the muthafuckin' Dogg Pound 
 That's the only way we'll beat 'em man 
 We gotta smoke 'em, then choke 'em 
 Like the muthafuckin' peter man 
 It's like 3 & to the 2 
 And 2 & to the 1 
 Cell block 4 peace Doggy Dogg's done. 
 Outro : Bushwick Bill 
 Yo, now you know the path I'm on 
 You think your strong, see if you can travel on 
 'Cause only the weak, will try to speak 
 Those who are quiet, will always cause riots 
 There's 3 types of people in the world 
 Those who don't know what happened 
 Those who wonder what happened 
 And people like us from the streets that 
 make 
 things happen!"

 Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks 
 Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks 
 Lick on these nuts and suck the dick 
 Gets the fuck out after you're done 
 And I hops in my ride to make a quick run 
 Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks 
 Lick on these nuts and suck the dick 
 Gets the fuck out after you're done 
 And I hops in my ride to make a quick run 
 Dr. Dre: 
 I used to know a bitch named Eric Wright 
 We used to roll around and fuck the hoes at night 
 Tighter than a motherfucker with the gangsta beats 
 And we was balling on the motherfucking Compton streets 
 Peep, the shit got deep and it was on 
 Number one song after number one song 
 Long as my motherfucking pockets was fat 
 I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at 
 But she was hanging with a white bitch doing the shit she do 
 Sucking on his dick just to get a buck or two 
 And the few ends she got didn't mean nothing 
 Now she's suing 'cause the shit she be doing ain't shit 
 Bitch can't hang with the streets, she found herself short 
 So now she's taking me to court 
 It's real conversation for your ass 
 So recognize, and pass to Daz 
 Daz Dilinger and Snoop Dogg: 
 Now as I'm rolling with my nigga Dre and Eastwood 
 Fucking hoes, clocking dough up to no good 
 We flip-flop and serve hoes like flapjacks 
 (But we don't love them hoes) Bitch and it's like that 
 This is what you look for in a hoe who got cash flow 
 You run up in them hoes and grab the cash and get your dash on 
 While you're chilling with your homies and shit 
 And how my niggas kick the anthem like this (Beeotch) 
 Snoop Dogg: 
 Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks 
 Lick on these nuts and suck the dick 
 Gets the fuck out after you're done 
 And I hops in my ride to make a quick run 
 Kurupt and Snoop Dogg: 
 To the store to get me a 4-0 
 Snoop Doggy Dogg paged that must mean more hoes 
 So I head down the street to Long Beach just so I could meet a freak 
 To lick me from my head to my feet 
 And I'm here, now I'm ready to be done up 
 Nothing but homies around so I puts my gun up 
 Bitches on my nuts like clothes, heh 
 But I'm from the Pound and we don't love them hoes 
 How could you trust a hoe? (Why?) 'cause a hoe's a trick 
 We don't love them tricks (Why?) 'cause a trick's a bitch 
 And my dick's constantly in her mouth 
 And turning them trick-ass hoes the fuck out now 
 Snoop Dogg: 
 I once had a bitch named Mandy May 
 Used to be all in them guts like every day 
 The pussy was the bomb, had a nigga on sprung 
 I was in love like a motherfucker licking the pearl tongue 
 The homies used to tell me that she wasn't no good 
 But I'm the maniac in black, Mr. Snoop Eastwood 
 So I figure niggas wouldn't trip with mine 
 Guess what? Got gaffled by one time 
 I'm back to the motherfucking county jail 
 Six months on my chest, now it's time to bail 
 I gets released on a hot sunny day 
 My nigga D.O.C. and my homey Dr. Dre 
 Scooped in a coupe, ""Snoop we got news 
 Your girl was tricking while you was draped in your county blues"" 
 I ain't been out a second 
 And already gotta do some motherfucking chin-checkin' 
 Move up the block as we groove down the block 
 See my girl's house, ""Dre, pass the Glock"" 
 Kick in the do', I look on the flo' 
 It's my little cousin Daz and he's fucking my hoe, yo (Bitches ain't shit) 
 I uncock my shit 
 I'm heart-broke but I'm still loc'ed, man, fuck a bitch 
 Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks 
 Lick on these nuts and suck the dick 
 Gets the fuck out after you're done 
 And I hops in my ride to make a quick run 
 Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks 
 Lick on these nuts and suck the dick 
 Gets the fuck out after you're done 
 And I hops in my ride to make a quick run 
 Jewell and Snoop Dogg: 
 (Bitches ain't shit) 
 Oh yeah 
 I don't give a fuck about a bitch (Bitches ain't shit) 
 But I and her know that they can't fade this 
 'Cause I'm doin' my own thang down with the swang (Bitches ain't shit) 
 I'm hanging with Death Row like it ain't no thang 
 I say you know you can't deal 'cause I'm a bitch that's real (Bitches ain't shit) 
 Motherfuckers need to step back, hell yeah they need to chill 
 Because I don't give a fuck and I don't give a fuck (Bitches ain't shit) 
 And I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck 
 And now I gotta do some shit that's clean (Bitches ain't shit) 
 But when I'm on a dick, hell yeah, I get real mean, hah 
 Like a washing machine, I can wash the clothes 
 All the hoes knows that I'm on the flo', hoe 
 But they can't hang with my type on swang (Bitches ain't shit) 
 I ain't trying to say I suck every ding-a-lang 
 But just the juicy ones with the tip of the tongue 
 And then they're sprung and with the nuts hung (Bitches ain't shit)"

 Oh, here they come, from the back in they 'llacs

 ""We give you 20 Gs if you snitch on your homey 
 We'll put you in a home and make your life plush

17,Dr. Dre,hiphop,Bridgette,"There once was this girl I knew named Bridgette 
 She asked me was my dick a grown man or a midget 
 Of course I had to show her all my balls ring ding a ling 
 I whipped out my whopper but we wasn't at Burger King 
 Nothing more said she grabbed it like a vice grip 
 And asked the DOC do you mind if I nibble this 
 No, I took her to the back of the studio 
 And, she ate up on the doc like a cheerio 
 I told the bitch yo please don't bite me 
 Then she made me scream when she grabbed the balls tightly 
 So I slapped the bitch for goin' out like a sucker 
 My dick was in her mouth so she bit the mother fucker 
 To make her stop I pulled up on her extensions 
 And I left Jimmy standing at attention 
 The look on my eyes told the bitch she was a goner 
 Now I look back on the day I should have peed on her 
 (Bridgette) Was a girl that I knew but 
 (Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho) 
 (Bridgette) was a girl that I screwed but, 
 (Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho) 
 So you know bridgette called me the next day 
 Just to apologize so I said ok 
 She claims she wants to make it up to the DOC 
 And you know I'm still out to get the pussy 
 Tried to be nice 'cause I didn't wanna diss her 
 Passed Mickie Dees and went to the Sizzler 
 Ordered the food, she started rubbin my knee 
 Then I could tell that she wanted to fuck me 
 She said Lets skip dinner and I had a fit 
 At ten dollars a plate I said fuck that shit 
 That's the whole reason our relationship was stormy 
 Why 'cause Bridgette was too fuckin' horny 
 She said please excuse me for a minute 
 To powder my nose I said ya I'm with it 
 She took a long time the food came and I'm chewin 
 Thinkin' to myself what the fuck is she doin'? 
 Went to look for her and I heard alot of screamin 
 Looked in a room and the waiters were teamin 
 Up on the bitch like it ain't no thang 
 But I flipped 'cause it was Bridgette gettin' gang-banged 
 (Bridgette) Was a girl that I knew but 
 (Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho) 
 (Bridgette) was a girl that I screwed but, 
 (Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho) 
 Yo Dre, you would have screwed the bitch too 'cause 
 (Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho) 
 (Bridgette) I'd wear a rubber if I were you 'cause yo 
 (Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho) 
 So you know Bridgette called me the next day 
 Just to apologize so I said ok 
 She says she wants to come over and see me 
 And do any thing to fuck the DOC 
 She said she loves me but I didn't say I love her 
 Went to the store and bought me some rubbers 
 Then I made a phone call up to the guys 
 Boy this bitch is in for a big surprise 
 When she came in I put on a stone record 
 Said a few lines and the bitch got naked 
 Later on the bed I told her to suck my dick 
 And ran Easy, Cube, and Dre, ran out the closet 
 Turned her ass over laid the ho on her back 
 Then we rode the bitch like a mother fuckin' Amtrak 
 Dre had the back and Easy had the front 
 I'm behind Ice Cube 'cause that's where the line started 
 Bitch gettin' dogged bye the DOC and NWA 
 Dogged the bitch out in each in every way 
 That's what I thought but with a girl like Bridgette 
 The dumb ass ho she liked the shit 
 (Bridgette) Was a girl that I knew but 
 (Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho) 
 (Bridgette) was a girl that I screwed but, 
 (Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho) 
 Yo Dre, you would have screwed the bitch too 'cause 
 (Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho) 
 (Bridgette) I'd wear a rubber if I were you 'cause yo

 Word takes place in the city of L.A. 
 I'm nine years old to be exact 
 Check the bell bottoms, brown shirt with the dusty ol' cap 
 Goin' to the inn to see my dad 
 And to get some new business 
 Two dollars what a bargain 
 I'm sittin' up the street while I'm humpin' a tune 
 The first time but witness somebody's tryin' ta jack fool 
 The bump director was a also tryin' ta jack a '6-4 
 Brothers tryin' ta tip-toe and yo 
 Pointin' at gauges tryin' ta take a brother's yeah 
 He saw what was up, got out the beat and go and bail 
 He just had to run in my direction 
 But they smoked the players 
 Now he's next to the sports section 
 But the player dropped the yeah on the ground 
 So then I picked it up, run down and around 
 The corner, yo but through a nearby alley 
 Escaped through a tiny gate 
 'Cause I was nickel slick 
 'Cause I was nickel slick 
 'Cause I was nickel slick 
 'Cause I was nickel slick 
 Huffin' and puffin' but I finally got to the pad 
 My mother axe me where I was I said, ""Yo, 
 I was over Snowy's house playin' some marks"" 
 She believed what I said so I went to my cars 
 You see I ship bones with my cousin, now he's mentally slow 
 But he was a big ole kid, 6'5â€, 300 pounds or more 
 Nicknamed 'Big Truck', took the shit out my pants around the product 
 Told my cousin we gotta hustle and bustle to make money back 
 I make connections, you watch my back 
 Set up a program, go and live instate 
 But I wasn't sellin' drinks, I was sellin' big bags 
 O' hundreds and quarters of doves, yeah 
 At this time I was gettin' more pud, yo 
 From this car and that car and everybody wanna caught glockin' 
 But me and Truck we was in luck 
 But the spot got hot, police raid, they took Truck to jail 
 But me, I got away, I was nickel slick 
 'Cause I was nickel slick 
 I was nickel slick 
 'Cause I was nickel slick 
 Four years past, now I'm thirteen 
 All-meat duster to go undercover 
 My cousin's jail sentence was almost finished 
 Now we packin' the streets in a mix, in it to win it 
 Calling cards, checkin' fools, checkin' names down 
 Now I'm steady (unverified) sent to the ground 
 Other hustlers knew I was doin' my best 
 'Cause I was a bawla young fly player from the West 
 All the pimped up cribs and comeona 
 I'm up on the city so that way I can hit corners 
 Now who would expect this little juvenile delinquent's 
 Straight bawlin' y'all as they kept on bawlin' for it 
 It was a smooth operation you see 
 'Cause I had to your whole entire family lumpy 
 Five years swoop now I'm eighteen 
 I was steadily pimpin' Uncle Sam and foldin' the pimp game 
 At this time I was bust smokin' 5's 
 Hook us up with an eighty cell (unverified) 
 Lei Long was in effect and he said, ""Let's do this"" 
 Gave it up to eat then I sighed all poopless 
 But Truck was left on the spot, he knew what I'd do 
 Hooked my cousin up with the crib and effect, not 
 The Truck was livin' high, livin' schwell 
 Me, I'm gettin' paid for my mega record sales 
 So there it is, a player comin' up quick 
 I guess I drawn a whole organization of players that are nickel slick 
 I guess I was nickel slick 
 'Cause I was nickel slick 
 I was nickel slick 
 Yo Stan, won't cha price some nickel slick from me 
 Right here, yeah, aha 
 Why don't cha swing it up right here? 
 Ah yeah, wooh, nigga sanctified, ah, right here

24,Dr. Dre,hiphop,The Watcher,"Things just ain't the same for gangstas 
 Times is changing, young niggas is aging 
 Becoming OGs in the game and changing 
 To make way for these new names and faces 
 But the strangest things can happen from rapping 
 When niggas get wrapped up in image and acting 
 Niggas get capped up and wrapped in plastic 
 Zipped up in bags, when it happens, that's it 
 I've seen 'em come, I've watched 'em go 
 Watched 'em rise, witnessed it and watched 'em blow 
 Watched 'em all blossom and watched 'em grow 
 Watched the lawsuits when they lost the dough 
 Best friends and money: I lost them both 
 Went visited niggas in the hospital 
 It's all the same shit all across the globe 
 I just sit back and watch the show 
 Eminem and Knock-Turn'Al: 
 Everywhere that I go ain't the same as befo' (The watcher) 
 People I used to know just don't know me no mo' (The watcher) 
 But everywhere that I go, I got people I know (The watcher) 
 Who got people they know so I suggest you lay low (I watch) 
 Dr. Dre: 
 I moved out of the hood for good, you blame me? 
 Niggas aim mainly at niggas they can't be 
 But niggas can't hit niggas they can't see 
 I'm out of sight, now I'm out of they dang reach 
 How would you feel if niggas wanted you killed? 
 You'd probably move to a new house on a new hill 
 And choose a new spot, if niggas wanted you shot 
 I ain't a thug, how much 2Pac in you you got? 
 I ain't no bitch, neither, it's either my life or your life 
 And I ain't leaving, I like breathing 
 'Cause nigga, we can go round for round 
 Clip for clip, shit, fo'-pound for pound 
 Nigga, if you really want to take it there, we can 
 Just remember that you fucking with a family man 
 I got a lot more to lose than you, remember that 
 When you wanna come and fill these shoes 
 Eminem and Knock-Turn'Al: 
 Everywhere that I go ain't the same as befo' (The watcher) 
 People I used to know just don't know me no mo' (The watcher) 
 But everywhere that I go, I got people I know (The watcher) 
 Who got people they know so I suggest you lay low (I watch) 
 Dr. Dre: 
 Things just ain't the same for gangstas 
 Cops is anxious to put niggas in handcuffs 
 They wanna hang us, see us dead, enslave us 
 Keep us trapped in the same place we're raised in 
 Then they wonder why we act so outrageous 
 Run around stressed outand pull out gauges 
 'Cause every time you let the animal out cages 
 It's dangerous to people who look like strangers 
 But now we got a new era of gangstas 
 Hustlers and youngsters living amongst us 
 Lookin' at us, now calling us busters 
 Can't help but reminisce back when it was us 
 Nigga, we started this gangsta shit! 
 And this the motherfucking thanks I get? 
 It's funny how time fly 
 I'm just having fun just watching it fly by 
 Eminem and Knock-Turn'Al: 
 Everywhere that I go ain't the same as befo' (The watcher) 
 People I used to know just don't know me no mo' (The watcher)

 Who got people they know so I suggest you lay low (I watch)

 But you also don't have any idea how much I love you

 I've just always wanted someone like you in my life 
 I love you so much that I'd do anything, I'd do anything

 All them nights I never had bitches 
 Now I'm all up in that ass bitches 
 Mad at your boyfriend, ain't 'cha? 
 You'se a bad girl, gotta spank ya 
 Gotta thank ya for that head clinic 
 Explicit, hella photogenic 
 And tell your friends where the dick's at 
 Where they can get hit and won't get back to they soulmate 
 Before you kiss 'em use Colgate 
 She swallowed it, yeah the bitch took the whole eight 
 And ran with it, then let Mel-Man hit it 
 And Hittman hit it, damn bitches 
 Man, this is what I'm talkin' about 
 Chicken head, chicken fed with a dick in yo' mouth 
 Out and about with your nigga like it never took place

 You've got a husband who loves you 
 Don't need you all in mine 
 I just wanna fuck you, we can't be kissing and hugging girl 
 You've got a husband who loves you 
 You need to give him your quality time 
 You got the number, it's on you to make the call 
 You know I come quick help you redecorate your walls 
 Cut your backyard, don't have to act hard to get the cock 
 And if I'm going too far, I take it out and wipe it off 
 And put it back up, and keep going 
 You tryin' to hide it from your husband but I know he be knowin' 
 That your pussy's been tampered with 
 Did you show him the new trick of how you can make it smoke a cancer stick? 
 You be workin it like a dancer, bitch, it's hard on me 
 Not to give you all of my time that you wanted 
 You can give me some head, but keep the breakfast in bed 
 I'd rather spend my morning digging through some records instead 
 But, tonight I guess it'd be aight if we can touch bases 
 Hook up somewhere and exchange some Fuck Faces 
 I know your man's looking for ya, he's always trying to run ya 
 Don't worry 'bout me handcuffing girl 'cause I just wanna 
 Snoop Dogg: 
 Fuck witchu 
 On the sneak tip, on some creep shit 
 So whatcha gon' do, you freak bitch? 
 You acting like you don't do dicks 
 That's the kinda bitch I hate fuckin' with 
 Baby was a virgin, that's what she said 
 So I gave her some Hennessy, she gave me some head 
 I fucked her on the floor so I wouldn't mess up my bed 
 Then Lil half-dead put his dick on her head 
 Take that bitch home and give her a bone 
 And give her the number to my cellular phone 
 Now she's blowing up my pager, the shit's gettin' major 
 A favor for a favor, this dick is what I gave her 
 Something to go by and bitches know why 
 Stuff dick in they mouth and then I'm out (See-ya)

 'Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock 
 You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block

 And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet 
 My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat 
 Treat rap like Cali weed, I smoke till I sleep 
 Wake up in the AM compose a beat 
 I bring the fire till your soakin' in your seat 
 It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth 
 Since Turn Out the Lights from the World Class Wreckin' Cru 
 I'm still at it, after-mathematics

 Pimping bitches on the regular, I put that on the G 
 A hustler and a player, nowadays it pays to be 
 Let me drop some shit about this bitch I used to know 
 She gave your boy the head and said don't let nobody know 
 A bonafide pro, I had to grab the ho 
 She got freaky in your '64, I skeeted in her throat 
 Been knowing the ho for four days, pimping repays 
 And I bet you didn't know that she go both ways 
 She ate her best friend, I left them hoes at the mote'

 What's the difference between me and you? 
 What's the difference between me and you? 
 Dr. Dre: 
 Back when 
 Cube 
 was rollin' wit Lorenzo in a 
 Benzo 
 I was bangin' wit a gang of instrumentals 
 Got the pens and pencils, got down to business, but sometimes 
 The business end of this shit can turn your friends against you 
 But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you 
 I still remember the window of the car that you went through 
 That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through 
 And I'ma do whatever it takes to convince you 
 'Cause you my nigga Doc, and 
 Eazy 
 I'm still wit you 
 Fuck the beef, nigga I miss you, and that's just bein real wit you 
 You see the truth is 
 Everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is, and who I'm still cool wit 
 Then I got these fake-ass niggaz I first drew with 
 Claimin they non-violent; talkin' like they... 
 (voice sample: ""Do not resist the beat"") 
 Spit venom in interviews, speakin' on reunions 
 Move units, then talk shit and we can do this 
 Until then - I ain't even speakin' your name 
 Just keep my name outta yo' mouth and we can keep it the same 
 Nigga, it ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors 
 It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em 
 That's the difference 
 Chorus: Phish 
 What's the difference between me and you? 
 You talk a good one - but you don't do what you supposed to do 
 I act on what I feel and never deal wit emotions 
 I'm used to living big-dog-style and straight coastin 
 What's the difference between me and you?

 Come and get it, shitted on villians by the millions

 So what the fuck am I supposed to do? 
 I pop bottles and hot 
 hollow-points 
 at each and all of you (Come on!) 
 A heartless bastard, high and plastered 
 My style is like the reaction from too much acid 
 Never come down - pass it around, you can't handle it 
 Hang Hollywood niggaz by they 
 ""Soul Train""

 Eminem: 
 Well, that's cool, and I appreciate the offer 
 But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma 
 I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her 
 And cruise around wit her for seven hours through California 
 And have her wavin at people (Hi!) Then drop her off on the corner 
 At the police station and drive off honkin the horn for her 
 Raw dawg, get your arm gnawed off 
 Drop the 
 sawed off 
 and beat you wit the piece it was sawed off of 
 Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up 
 Get shot up in the hot tub till the bubbles pop up 
 And they nose and cough snot up, mucus in hot water 
 That's for tryin' to talk like 
 The Chronic 
 was lost product 
 That's for even THINKIN' of havin' them thoughts thought up! 
 You better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up! 
 So what's the difference between us? We can start at the penis 
 Or we can scream 
 ""I Just Don't Give a Fuck"" 
 and see who means it!

 Y'all know me, still the same ol' G, but I been low-key 
 Hated on by most these niggas with no cheese, no deals and no G's 
 No wheels and no keys, no boats no snowmobiles and no skis 
 Mad at me 'cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries 
 Got a crib with a studio and it's all full o' tracks, to add to the wall full o' plaques 
 Hangin' up in the office in back of my house like trophies 
 Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze, ho please 
 You better bow down on both knees, who you think taught you to smoke trees 
 Who you think brought you the oldies, Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C.'s 
 The Snoop D-O-double-G's, and the group that said ""motherfuck tha police"" 
 Gave you a tape full dope beats to bump, when you stroll through in your 'hood 
 And when your albums sales wasn't doin' too good, who's the doctor they told you to go see 
 Y'all better listen up closely, all you niggas that said that I'd turned pop 
 Or The Firm flopped, y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin' no sleep 
 So fuck y'all, all o' y'all, if y'all don't like me, blow me 
 Y'all gon' keep fuckin' around wit' me, and turn me back to the old me

 Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way (Yup) 
 Just study a tape of N.W.A 
 One day I was walkin' by, with a Walkman on, when I caught a guy 
 Giving an awkward eye, ( 
 What you lookin' at 
 ) strangled him up in the parkin' lot with his Karl Kani's 
 I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not, I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge 
 When I'm drunk as fuck, right next to a humongous truck in a two car garage 
 Hoppin' out with two broken legs, tryna walk it off, fuck you too bitch call the cops 
 I'm 'a kill you and them loud-ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs 
 And when the cops came through, me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house 
 With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches, and still weren't found out ( 
 Right here 
 ) 
 So from here on out, it's The Chronic 2, startin' today and tomorrow's anew 
 And I'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew ( 
 Chikka-chikka-chikka

 But now that I gots lil' company, everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease 
 But you won't get a crumb from me, 'cause I'm from the streets of ( 
 C—C—Compton, Compton 
 ) 
 I told 'em all, all them lil' gangsters who you think help mold 'em all 
 Now you wanna run around talkin' 'bout guns like I ain't got none, what you think I sold 'em all 
 'Cause I stay well off, now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' ""Dre fell off"" 
 What, 'cause I been in the lab, with a pen an' a pad tryna get this damn label off 
 I ain't havin' that, this is the millennium of Aftermath and ain't gon' be nothin' after that 
 So gimme one more platinum plaque and fuck rap, you can have it back 
 So where's all the mad rappers at, it's like a jungle in this habitat

 All up in them panties, I got this bitch speakin' Spanish

 Might not be a freak, but she got on the choosin' shoes 
 Dollar signs are folded, I can't control it 
 Tryin' to leave her, beeper just exploded 
 She sweatin' me, won't let me, broad turned fraud

 Man it's a trip I don't trip I'm in yo' Lexus flexin'

 Naw ""Ho"" ain't short for honey, almost had to wail her like Bunny 
 Tellin' tales of bein' pregnant, catchin' Nordstrom sales with abortion money 
 I spotted her, seen her with my nigga when I shot at her 
 Now we got beef, he caught up in the ho's erotica 
 Exotic, she's psychotic, rockin' his Nautica 
 Soon he'll need antibiotics (Suck it bitch) 
 Name a sexual disease, she got it like Sam Goody 
 You be like, ""Damn how could she hit me off with chlamydia?"" 
 Fool I pity ya, we live in the city of ballers 
 With more bounce and in a Zapp, she will doo wa ditty ya 
 Prettier to grittier, the wittier can get her 
 To the Hotel, Niko, on some Sauve shit like Rico 
 That's when I caught a Vision like Coleco 
 A high-post ho, a perfect way for me to keep dough 
 Huh, have her sellin' ass on Bronson Ave. and Pico 
 Kurupt: 
 At the hotel, motel, or the Holiday Inn (Say what nigga?) 
 I said if that bitch keep fuckin' up (Beeotch) then we'll fuck her friends 
 I said I dip, dive, what can I say? 
 Niggas need to stop fuckin' with OJ 
 Some niggas bang Blood, some niggas bang Crip 
 And bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks 
 I had a dream of hoes, I had to screen my hoes 
 I seen my hoes in all kinds of clothes 
 Little Almond Joy, I truly enjoy 
 If you blew my balls, right through my drawers 
 Come back to the mansion, chill at the spot 
 From the way she was blowin', I know she does it a lot 
 I have a eight-and-a-half, nine-and-three-quarters 
 The ho started callin' when I started boss ballin' 
 Gimme some head, gimme some ass (Uh-huh) 
 Gimme some cash, pass it to Daz 
 Pass it to Snoop, or pass it to Nate 
 See hoes eat dick like eggs and steak 
 It ain't shit new, I thought you knew (What?) 
 I knew you would, you wish you could 
 Break a G down, break me down 
 But I'mma see you on the rebound (What what?) D.P. style

 When I see you in the spot, you just Ackrite, you know what I'm sayin'? 
 When I yank you by the fuckin' perm 
 Don't be lookin' at a nigga crazy 
 Just get with the digits and be the fuck out. You know what I'm sayin'? 
 Let me break it down for y'all. 
 It was just one of those days 
 When I wanted to catch sunrays 
 Fun to get blunted on a Sunday, afternoon 
 Nigga Gabe got room, grab the gat for misbehavors 
 And the chocolate faded boom, flossin' hip-hop tunes 
 Zoom-zoom like the Commodoors 
 Wonder will we have drama or, end up clownin' whores 
 Around the full good to go girls 
 Like them BarybY Coast girls, ridin' shotgun, baby 
 I be postin' all world in The Riyd 
 Sippin' 151 that gave me too much pride to back down 
 Soon as we get to The Beach I'm a put my fuckin' mack down 
 I'm playin' lead, not the background 
 It's time to put Bronson on the map now 
 Walk with my hand on my Johnson, crack a smile 
 Cuties peep my style, if I don't get some Ackrite 
 I'm a have to act wild. 
 Chorus: sung by Hittman 
 Blunt in my left hand, drink in my right 
 Strap by my waistline 'cause niggas don't fight 
 Sucker free for life, so you better think twice. 
 (Aight? nD give A nigga' some Ackrite, right) 
 I'm the type of nigga player haters don't like 
 Snatchin' up your honey for some late night hype 
 Snobby ass bitches get slapped out of spite. 
 (Aight? So give a nigga' some Ackrite, right) 
 Hittman: 
 Uh... drink kickin' in, I'm stimulated 
 For those that don't know big words 
 I'm fuckin' faded 
 83 degrees, ease to a shaded spot 
 Our first spot was cool till some gangsta's made it hot 
 Now we plot and pose 
 Plus we watchin' hoes, with lots of flesh exposed 
 Gettin' swarmed by those type of niggas 
 With no game but brown nose 
 So I impose only like pros can 
 ""Yo, is this your man?"" ""No."" 
 Grab the bitch's hand ""I'm Hittman."" 
 Bling! Gold chain gleam 
 ""Your very eligible for my summer league team."" 
 Maybe too extreme 'cause the sister got steamed 
 Then Miss Thing tried to scream on my brethern 
 I got mad spit flame on the name 
 Stefan, tattooed on her arm 
 Hoe you ain't the bomb, must be a dyke 
 Witcho' lips swoll and give a nigga' some Ackrite.

 Hittman: 
 Frontin' on Ack-rite, causin' me to act up 
 Good Samaritan save that hoe from gettin' slapped up 
 My homies crack up at the scene I made 
 Yo my actions ain't serene when a nigga's on fade 
 If it wasn't for the 1 time brigade 
 I would've sprayed at the hooker tramp 
 As cops parade I'm afraid it's time to break camp 
 Make tracks, where else can we go to take hoes 
 From fake macks {*CAR HORN*} aiyyo, chase them girls 
 In that black Maxima, the passenger, almost fractured her 
 Neckbone, lookin' back at us 
 Plus, they on the dick 'cause the cap is hush 
 They blush, I bumrush the hush, with the largest crush 
 Try to swing an ep tonight so I don't have to keep in touch 
 Keep it on hush without the tippin' 
 Mackin' interrupted by some niggas set trippin' 
 Clip in the strap, I showed these niggas how to act.

 Niggaz ringin' they ass up in the wrong part of town 
 Better turn they car around 
 Rollin' the window down (Eminem: Hey can we talk it out?)

 Johnny got a shotgun 
 And he ain't even strong enough to cock one 
 Fuck tryin' to job hunt 
 Niggaz got AK's, niggaz is way crazier 
 Than Dre was back in his N.W.A. days 
 Niggaz spray strays and shoot without lookin' 
 Niggaz walk by and blast without leavin' a footprint 
 I think the attitudes are twice as worst 
 It takes half the time to get your life reversed 
 Always tryin' to play Rambo with they ammo 
 Make a nigga wanna stay in family mode

 Late nights is full of led that whistles as it goes by 
 Murder arrives, anytime 
 Bullets take flight when the fo'-five ignites 
 Some hearts skip a beat, some get blew out, and every light 
 Put you in the site of youngsters with automatics 
 Bustin' on shit to lay everything down even tourists and non-affiliates 
 These days, gun play is official with green lights on every block 
 Know the sign tells you too it's not best to stop 
 On every corner, Cali niggaz are dumpin 
 You'll be shakin your soul loose from the box at the coroner's 
 Makin' death not so foreign to ya 
 Niggaz got Rugers and M-14's with enough, 
 Ammo to leave an armored truck swiss cheese 
 I've learned to stay away from house parties 
 I've seen too many go and end up absent without leavin' 
 Ain't no, warm welcomings, my eyes have witnessed the bend in on 
 Nights that don't sleep, and fireworks until dawn 
 Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is 
 Bang bang! bang bang! 
 No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is

 Niggaz doin' brothers in worse than the Klan 
 Can't even stand, in front of your buildin and chill 
 Without yieldin, twelve-year-old children that kill 
 Blood spillin, thugs be illin, unnecessary slugs 
 Fillin the sky, usually drillin the one 
 That wasn't willin' to die, yes sir in the Killing Field 
 I got my, life preserver 
 And I'll do my time for murder, these niggaz got the nerve to 
 Question me - 'bout the colors that I got on? 
 Now see that red dot on your knot 
 'Bout to get your whole crew shot on 
 A Soldier of Fortune, I'm the wrong nigga to plot on 
 Took him out on the spot before he even got on

 Bust round, bloody the ground, retaliation sounds like this

 A message to God 
 Since you finishing 'em early, what possessed you to start him? 
 We made a vow, later we'll regret till death do us part 
 Lord, I thought we was made for each other 
 You shouldn't connect those, made to be taken away from each other 
 Now what I'm supposed to do? I'm only half the man that I was 
 I'll never last 'cause my better half is up there with you 
 You knew what you was doing when you made us; so with all due respect 
 You coulda forgave him, you didn't have to take him 
 He can take the game with him 'cause he defines the word 
 The one who puts the G in it, who you think put me in it? 
 I'm feeling like my whole world is blinded, wondering why 
 Crying, pouring out my heart, pouring out liquor behind it 
 We fought like brothers, something we never should do 
 We coulda used time spent arguing telling the truth 
 He had talent too, I had plans on watching him grow 
 Don't know what hurts more, seeing him leave, or watching him go

 You either quit, or you gon' play it like you get it

 To straight breaking down and showing all emotions 
 I'm anxious to believe in real G's don't cry

46,Dr. Dre,hiphop,Intro (Compton),"Compton was the American dream 
 Sunny California with a palm tree in the front yard, the camper, the boat 
 Temptingly close to the Los Angeles ghetto in the fifties and sixties, it became the black American Dream 
 Open housing paved the way as middle-class blacks flooded into the city 
 Whites don't buy houses in Compton anymore 
 Now with 74% of the population, black power is the fact of life from banks to bowling alleys 
 But the dream that many blacks thought they were buying has turned sour 
 Though the mayor and four out of five city councilmen are black, they have been unable to solve the problems of crime and growing welfare which is slowing turning suburban Compton into an extension of the black inner city 
 Crime is now as high as the ghetto 
 Forty-seven homicides last year gave Compton one of the highest per capita rates in the country 
 Juvenile gang activity, muggings, small robberies make some blacks want to leave"

 It's kind of funny how they fall back on me 
 I used to never get a call back, homie 
 Before the money they didn't see me like it's dark and it's all black, homie 
 But now they switching cause the card black, homie 
 It wasn't always that way 
 We was recording on the 4-track, homie 
 New apartment, no fridge, no mattress, no table, no cable 
 And all I hear is my girl in my ear 
 And this nigga Eazy asking for his car back, homie 
 I would've never saw this happening from that far back, homie 
 What it came to be, would have never believed, living the life I lived in C-P-T 
 A motherfucking dream to reality is what you call that, homie 
 Justus 
 It was something to me 
 No eat, no sleep, wasn't nothing to me 
 Can't always be how you want it to be 
 And I'm the one that they looking up to 
 Fuck they expecting from me? 
 BJ the Chicago Kid 
 And it all falls back on me 
 Sometimes, somehow, it all falls back on me 
 (Somehow it always fall back on me) 
 No matter where we are, no matter what we doing, it's on me 
 If it was up to you that's just the way it's always gon' be 
 Dr. Dre 
 (Listen to me) 
 That's just the way it is, and how it always was 
 DJing parties in my neighborhood just for the love 
 Dope dealers overtipping and bitches stripping 
 And any minute niggas'll start tripping and start shooting shit 
 On any given day I'm like ""what the fuck?"" 
 Face down on the pavement with the billy clubs 
 Took that feeling to the studio and cued it up 
 And now it's ""Fuck the Police"" all up in the club 
 Now it's '91 and Snoop Dogg came to visit 
 And was like ""What up 'cause? Let me show you what this chronic like"" 
 Couldn't help myself, just had to dip into that chronic life 
 And then that night came in when that nigga Knight came in (woo!) 
 This one of those dreams you don't wake up from 
 Then again, you don't sleep if you come from where I come from 
 Where the sun shines and they bust nines 
 No 9 plus 1-1 
 When they run up on your school bus with a two truck, you might learn something 
 BJ the Chicago Kid 
 And it all falls back on me 
 Sometimes, somehow, it all falls back on me 
 (Somehow it always fall back on me) 
 No matter where we are, no matter what we doing, it's on me 
 If it was up to you that's just the way it's always gon' be"
50,Dr. Dre,hiphop,All In A Day's Work,"Sittin' 'bout a hundred stories up, like what the fuck? 
 And I'm just lookin' at it all 
 I'll be right here in Los Angeles 
 Lookin' like a villain layin' low 
 Nothin' I can do but pack it all up 
 Goin' up, but shit, I feel the love 
 Spotlight on me and I'm feelin' so rare tonight 
 Actin' a fool and feelin' alive 
 I'm fuckin' flawless like I live in a vault 
 Only type of livin' I know 
 See if it was you you would've killed yourself by now 
 It takes a special kind of mothafucka to live like this 
 And they ask me how I do it 
 Mothafucka just take a look around 
 Best believe I'm in the buildin'I hear you mothafuckas talkin' and all that but 
 No, no don't mention me at all 
 Yeah comin' live and direct 
 And I know you feelin' some type of way about it, but uh 
 Watch your mouth, I dare your ass to say somethin' 
 I thought it was all good 
 But now you mothafuckas crossed the line 
 Kinda pissin' me off 
 All the fans and all the fame, and though I gave everything to this game 
 They still complain 
 Now what the fuck do y'all expect me to do? 
 There's so much fuckin' pressure 
 There's all this pressure 
 And it's all in a day's work 
 Work, hard 
 Workin' so hard 
 24/7, 3-6-5 
 365, hard work 
 It's all in a day's work 
 My whole life all I ever thought about was grindin' 
 Even though my surroundings only showed me crime and violence 
 That was back when a rapper needed guns way more than a stylus 
 And that was back when I felt like rappers was true mothafuckin' riders 
 Or even back in the day when I was a fuckin' youngster 
 Shit I was still sayin', ""Fuck the police"" 
 Born and raised in the belly of the beast 
 I had a dream that we was at peace 
 But I was so wrong. so wrong 
 Y'all too wrapped up in the bullshit and bias 
 Now reality TV talks about pulpits and choirs 
 Some of these hoes give less than a fuck when they runnin' their life story by us 
 It's the worst when I'm in a hotel, like a Hilton sick and tired 
 Some of these housewives way too fuckin' desperate 
 These bitches thinkin' fame first 
 I can't knock the hustle, it's all in a day's work 
 But that's that shit with potential to make the game worse 
 Shit it's just somethin' about that Hollywood curse 
 They just thirst 
 Hard times 
 I'm on my grind, fuck the part-time 
 Stay ready for war, I'm on the front line 
 I'm gettin' the feelin' like it's all mine 
 It's becoming the only feeling I know 
 Only type of livin' I know 
 Only type of livin' I know 
 Only type of livin' I know 
 Only type of livin' I know 
 Gonna go to work 
 We gotta work 
 We gotta work 
 Let's get back to work 
 On the grind, back to work 
 Let's work 
 Rich as fuck, but, guess what, I'm back to work 
 Overseas, back home, no time to sleep, I'm back to work 
 So many people that I love, they want my time but I got to work 
 Some of my friends don't understand I got to work 
 Always talkin' 'bout bustin' the club but I'm like, ""Fuck that I gotta work"" 
 If you really wanna do it like this, shit you better get back to work 
 Back to work 
 Right back to work 
 Gotta get back to work 
 Shit, right back to work"

 I went from hanging out down at the swap meet 
 To driving some of the hottest cars LA has ever seen 
 People been telling me I've grown into some kind of monster 
 But they don't know me though, I've been this way since seventeen 
 Tryna get finances poppin', man, I thought that was the object 
 To some of my niggas lost they life and then there goes the team 
 My only dream was holding us down like, ""Fuck who tryna stop us?"" 
 You could get the middle finger or the reddest beam 
 It's your choice, I took this industry by storm young and black, killing them softly 
 Don't ever call me fortunate, you don't know what it cost me 
 So anybody complaining about they circumstances lost me, homie 
 We ain't even talking, fuck that energy, fuck up off me

 I'm dealing with diligent Benjamin, how come my attitude piped down? 
 I'm fuckin' with Ice now 
 I'm fucking with shit that you only can get on an oversea flight now 
 You scared of my heights now 
 But still I got enemies giving me energy, I don't wanna fight now 
 Subliminally sent to me all of this hate, I thought I was holding the mic down 
 I thought I was holding my city up, I thought I was good in the media 
 You think I'm too hood in my video? But really no clue you idiot 
 I just can't help myself 
 Even when that record spin every now and then you hang yourself 
 'Cause I got the green and gold with a million sold, plus plenty more, and my dollar thick 
 But with or without all the diamonds though to you I'm just another nigga

 I tried to kill him but I guess I needed more practicing (boom, boom, boom) 
 That's when I realized, banging wasn't for everybody 
 Switch it up before my enemy or the sheriff got me

 They worry him to death, but he's no vegetarian

 Uh 
 Yeah, check it 
 These old sneakers, faded blue jeans 
 No tricks, no gimmicks, I be stomping down, down, down, down, down demons 
 Rolling up trees in the belly of the beast where the people disagree 
 The upper class hate, middle don't exist 
 The bottom of the beat, glad I got my sticks 
 Are you jumping on a fad? Laying in a ditch 
 I be stomping down demons, stomping down quick, come on 
 And please don't come around these parts 
 And tell me that we all a bunch of animals 
 The only time they wanna turn the cameras on 
 Is when we fuckin' shit up, come on 
 Bullets still ringing, blood on the cement 
 Black folks grieving, headlines reading 
 Tryna pay it no mind, you just living your life 
 Everyone is a witness, everyone got opinions 
 Got a son of my own, look him right in his eyes 
 I ain't living in fear but I'm holding him tight 
 Got a son of my own, look him right in his eyes 
 I ain't living in fear but I'm holding him tight 
 Dr. Dre: 
 Damn, why the fuck are they after me? 
 Maybe 'cause I'm a bastard or maybe 'cause of the way my hair grow naturally 
 Still tryna figure out why the fuck I'm full of rage 
 I think I noticed this bullshit right around the fifth grade 
 Paraphernalia in my locker right next to the switchblade 
 Nothing but pussy on my mind and some plans of getting paid 
 But I'm a product of the system raised on government aid 
 And I knew just how to react when it was time for that raid 
 Just a young black man from Compton wondering who could save us 
 And could barely read the sentences the justice system gave us 
 So many rental cars with bricks, I think they probably funded Avis 
 Some of us was unbalanced but some us used our talents, shit 
 Not all of us criminals but cops be yelling, ""Stay back nigga"" 
 We need a little bit of payback 
 Don't treat me like an animal 'cause all this shit is flammable 
 Don't fuck around 'cause when it's done it's done, fuck you 
 Anderson .Paak: 
 And the old folks tell me it's been going on since back in the day

 Don't nobody love this shit the way I love it 
 That's why I gotta hate it 
 Everybody out for fame, that ain't no exaggeration

 Eminem (Candice Pillay) 
 In the beginning a few of the people who had a problem 
 I was this good, scoffed, I just shook off 
 Probably reminded you of the first time you saw Tiger Woods golf 
 Never thought about how much my race and nationality meant 
 But based on how I ascended, see how plain it was now, they want me to jet 
 No one really gave a fuck about my descent, till I took off 
 Mistook me because I look soft 
 But I stood tall, I just follow the (Doctor's orders) 
 So I rose and grew balls, told these hoes to screw off 
 Decided opposing you is what I'm 'posed to do alls 
 I did was say what I'm feeling when the vocal booth calls 
 And had you on pins and needles when I spoke to you all 
 You felt my pain, it's almost like I poked voodoo dolls 
 And I hope my spirit haunts the studios when I'm gone 
 My picture jumps off a poster and just floats through the halls 
 And fucking goes through the walls like the ghost of Lou Rawls 
 Karma's headed for Armageddon, the drama setter 
 I'm going in, already got an arm and head 
 And whoever said word are just words 
 Can't hurt me more than I give a fuck 
 Even if my image ends up taking a personal hit 
 Whoever I hurt or whatever bridges I burned 
 In this bitch and whatever bitches feel like 
 They didn't deserve what they get 
 And whatever consequences come with every verse, it's worth it 
 So Doc turn the beat on, whose turn is it to get murdered on it? 
 And here's to all the years I spent toeing a line to overtime 
 As sure as I'm always lying, in my mind 
 I'm still underground as a groundhog and I'mma go for mine 
 Like a whole furrow just tryna dig up some gold and diamonds and coal to find 
 I'm starting to slow and these lines full of nines 
 I just load up the most rhymes and open fire with a closed mind 
 All I needed was someone to co-sign, been a (Doctor's) 
 Assault rifle with the sniper scope for this whole time 
 Day one, set with the blasters, give me the orders, I spray uh 
 Pain in the ass and get shot in the ass with a paint gun 
 Ain't no one safe from, non-believers there ain't none 
 I even make the bitches I rape cum 
 I'm waiting on someone to say something 
 Dre make the bass pump and let the tape run for old time's sake 
 I spit it straight through, this is take one 
 The moment you're waiting for has come but...

59,Dr. Dre,hiphop,Talking To My Diary,"I just need y'all to try to bear with me for a minute 
 While I talk about the pages of my diary 
 Listen up 
 I remember when I got started my intention was to win 
 But a lot of shit changed since then 
 Some more friends became enemies in the quest of victory 
 But I made a vow, never let this shit get to me 
 I let it pass, so I consider that part of my history 
 And I'm strong; financially, physically 
 Mentally I'm on a whole 'nother level 
 And don't forget that I came from the ghetto 
 Sold a new house for my moms, that's special 
 I let you going shopping till your feet get tired 
 Then a new Benz just for you to ride in 
 When I didn't have it, you provided 
 Don't be surprised that I built an enterprise 
 And my house got a view of the city like a highrise 
 I'm just talking to my diary, I'm just talking to my diary 
 When I open up my book I think about the world later 
 No ink in the pen, no lines on the paper 
 I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary 
 I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary 
 Sometimes when I got a lot of shit on my mind 
 I'm just staring at the sky, you probably thinkin' I'm high 
 I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary 
 I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary 
 Now puff-puff-pass got a nigga having flashbacks 
 I remember how it used to be 
 Now my money like NASDAQ, my checks you can cash that 
 I remember how it used to be 
 I used to be a starving artist so I would never starve an artist 
 This is my passion, it's where my heart is 
 It gets the hardest when I think about the dearly departed 
 Like the nigga I started with 
 I know Eazy can see me now, looking down through the clouds 
 And regardless, I know my nigga still proud 
 It's been a while since we spoke but you still my folks 
 We used to sit back, laugh and joke 
 Now I remember when we used to do all-nighters 
 You in the booth and Cube in the corner writing 
 Where Ren at? Shout out to my nigga Yella 
 Damn, I miss that 
 Shit, a nigga having flashbacks 
 When I open up my book I think about the world later 
 No ink in the pen, no lines on the paper 
 I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary 
 I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary 
 Sometimes when I got a lot of shit on my mind 
 I'm just staring at the sky, you probably thinkin' I'm high 
 I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary

 The Aftermath, A second growth, the period immediately following an unusual event 
 This is brought to you by, the makers of funky music

 (Sid McCoy) 
 Watch yourself, peep the blow up 
 From state-to-state we're touchin' home no matter what sign you throw up 
 Wait, we're on some other while you're still slippin' 
 Bringin' you all bangin' speakers for sparks fly out the car system 
 Off the tops, snatchin' props and the proper the tops we touch 
 We're hard to knock, we got it locked 
 From every angle of music the different sound view 
 R&B, rap, whatever flavor kid it's all new 
 So let's say we bring it with the EAST! and the WEST! 
 The final results: The Aftermath touchin' every coast! 
 So when the bar blows then, the DJ spins 
 And we don't set trip, we set trends 
 Love to the artists, in fact they be the smartest if they business is tight 
 'Cause keep it real means moving the cash markets 
 And constantly buildin' and stop destroying everything that we touch 
 And leave somethin' for our children 
 (RC) 
 Whatever it takes to get ya paid yeah-yeah-yeah, keep on doin' it

 Anybody killa!"
65,Dr. Dre,hiphop,As The World Keeps Turning,"As the world keeps turning, chronic keeps burning 
 (This ain't no) street sermon, these niggas are determined 
 I flow like CD's in the deck 
 Moosh fools in the face that lack respect 
 Protect ya arm, pitch from the funk 
 I deodirise the musty, ya rhymes are crusty, you can't bust G 
 So leave me alone I'm in the zone 
 Walkin' the streets on my own, nigga get blown 
 Some niggas say that nigga Where is gone 
 But I'm low in the cut and gotta microphone 
 Are you gone bust or play bones? 
 You motherfuckin clone, get off that nigga's style and get'cha own 
 It's Miscellane and it's on again 
 For the niggas that slept, they shoulda stayed in step 
 And kept ya big fuckin' mouth shut 
 I woke up with a stomach ache, headache, back ache 
 Advil, Tylenol, Peptol, slept so long realised my world is wrong 
 My world is gone like disco 
 Blowin' up Cisco and in my Cammo 
 Standin in back of me was my soul 
 Thinking of the easiest way to get a bank roll 
 Knowledge is urban-able, exhaust manifold 
 A tar can of hos to lubricate my system quick 
 Shaky bitches off the dick 
 'Cause she got a vice grip on the flow from my lips 
 I'm slow but equipped with the proper tools 
 Show me the one talkin' shit so I can drop a fool 
 I'm out to glow a nigga roll if he think he Mr CREAM 
 Come back on the scene and smoke a phillie, G 
 I really dream of gettin' mine now let me tell you what's silly 
 Me, buckin with my team is murder one 
 I heard a gun bustin' shots (SHOTS!), down the block (BLOCK!) 
 I guess a nigga gettin' what he got (GOT!) 
 Shit is heavy like a medicine ball and broke niggas to smoke niggas 
 I'll fuck one for y'all, they made ya last phone call 
 To a trick that didn't even care 
 'Cause she was gettin' fucked somewhere, you're stuck in there 
 Now you wanna bust, nigga, now you wanna kill, nigga (Nigga) 
 Nigga how ya feel? (Nigga) 
 You can't try to be real (You can't try to be real) 
 Shit is for real 
 I'm cooler than most, but I got the shorter temper 
 And I'm cooler than foes that don't know how it goes 
 Let's take it back to the first side 
 When you was a new jack and jockin my new track 
 But you was wrong, didn't know about the big long 
 Head-strong, nicknamed Dav from off the school yard 
 Witta teenage group I'm turnin' loots to tracks 
 Me and my niggas like (These tracks are laced with bomb weed and tight 
 Lyrics) 
 You wanna know what the hos used to do 
 When me and my crew came bustin' through 
 All sorts of blushins brew 
 (A neighbourhood find, a gift too swift, Miscellane is the crew) 
 Underground till my brown eyed balls turned blue 
 This is for the bitches and niggas that wanna front 
 I smoke on, I broke on till I spoke on 
 Miscellane packin shows like Farrakhan 
 Where is on another level with two niggas that's on the same plateau 
 Now that's three times your tightest flow 
 And three times ya tightest track, three times your fattest sack 
 Three times is clever (BUCK!) 
 Thou shalt rest in grief who lay buried in the belt 
 Barely included work, leaves bodies scarred and hurt 
 To art in hell, where the next man dwells 
 The place with stankin pussy and crack rock dwells"
66,Dr. Dre,hiphop,Bad Intentions,"Supa ugly 
 Put ya cups up 
 Get ya smoke in 
 Baby we partyin 
 Ain't nobody loccin 
 Who you provokin 
 What you want now 
 Take a look around 
 There's pimp shit goin' down 
 There's alota bitches 
 A whole lotta freaks 
 Top notch hoes 
 They flockin every week 
 What you wanna do 
 Get ya next thrill 
 Take a x pill 
 How the sex feel 
 Damn you lookin' good 
 All 10 of y'all 
 Wanna roll 
 Pump dick in y'all 
 Keep ya face down 
 Keep ya ass up 
 You know what you doin' 
 Keep that shit movin 
 Keep them titties jumpin' 
 Keep the henny comin' 
 Every bitch in here need to be touchin somethin' 
 I know they like it hot 
 That's why I keep it hot 
 So why the fuck could they not want a piece of doc? 
 I don't give a fuck 'cause I'm just drinkin', smokin', straight west coastin 
 Bitches puttin' ass in motion, pussy poppin', sex, promotin 
 Is that a cup? raise it up 
 Is that a blunt? blaze it up 
 Is that your bitch? on these nuts 
 Dre I don't give a fuck 
 All I really know is ya hoe wants to be with me 
 And she ain't playing and what I'm sayin' 
 She creeps with me and sleeps between the sheets 
 Soon as the door close 
 I make 'em curl toes 
 They all wanna get chose 
 We never love y'all 
 My niggas all macs 
 We sip alotta yac (cognac) 
 Fuck and never call back 
 Pack women in the club till it's pitch black 
 Thugs on the block wondering where their bitch at 
 Where you think nigga 
 She with the aftermath 
 Call the house she ain't home she with aftermath 
 No talking 
 Fuck how ya day goes 
 You want dick 
 Well bitch say so 
 Don't be shy now 
 Probably the best at it 
 They say a party ain't a party till the west had it 
 Gravitate to the doc like it's automatic 
 Take your clothes off 
 Make me wanna grab it 
 Turn around with it 
 Make me wanna stab it 
 Time to get it crackin' 
 Show me them bad habits 
 I don't give a fuck 'cause I'm just drinkin', smokin', straight west coastin 
 Bitches puttin' ass in motion, pussy poppin', sex, promotin 
 Is that a cup? raise it up 
 Is that a blunt? blaze it up 
 Is that your bitch? on these nuts 
 Dre I don't give a fuck 
 All I really know is ya hoe wants to be with me 
 And she ain't playing and what I'm sayin' 
 She creeps with me and sleeps between the sheets 
 When she's all alone she sneaks out to be with me 
 And what I'm sayin' is she ain't playin' 
 She creeps with me and sleeps between the sheets"
67,Dr. Dre,hiphop,Been There Done That,"I been there - been there 
 Done that - done that 
 You got guns? - we got guns... 
 Yo, I got straps - we got straps... 
 A million muthafuckas on the planet Earth talk that hard 
 Bullshit - 'cause it's all they worth... 
 No question, it's all about the D - O - E 
 So if money is the root I want the whole damn tree 
 Ain't tryin' to stock around for the Illuminati 
 Got to buy my own island by the year 2 G... 
 Since way back I've been collecting my fee 
 With the 48-tracks and the M - I - C 
 Got a palace in the Hills overlooking the sea 
 It's worth 8, but I only paid 5 point 3 
 Worldwide, got the triple beam, I slide 
 Listenin' to yo demo in a stretch limo 
 It's how I ride - cartel style 
 Full, stacked to the max now 
 A million-dollar smile, people wonder how 
 'Dre Day' every day. Trips to Montigo Bay 
 With more chips than Frito Lay 
 Flossed jewels in a tire, ain't nothin' fly 
 Straight or illegal - it's still the root of all evil... 
 'Cause... 
 Young black Rockefeller. Hell, a swiss and mozarella 
 Pockets sweller, gettin' money like a bank teller 
 'Cause a fool and his dough soon split 
 So when you come across a fool get all that she be gettin' 
 Ladies, get your paper too 
 Don't expect for no man to support you 
 Keep it true 
 'Cause most brothers are raised to decide for the pesos 
 My woman is independent, makin' dough by the case loads 
 I'mma keep buildin'... make it killing 
 Kick back, relax, and grow old with my millions 
 That's where it's at. You got drama, I got the gat 
 But we're both black so I don't wanna lay you flat 
 Instead let's get paper, while it's paper to get 
 Private Jet, 600 coupes that I runs if... 
 I'm livin' on another level that y'all ain't been yet 
 Spend a mill, no sweat, water the line with my wet... 
 This is for the millionaires 
 Throw a stack in the air and watch brothers start plottin' 
 Honeys start to stare 
 'Cause game is money and money is game 
 And broke brothers make the 45 flame with no shame 
 Now many people die over these dead green guys 
 Ignorance and greed take their ass by surprise 
 It's the root of all evil and sins 
 Yet and still it makes the world go around 
 Like my 20-inch rims... 
 Moolah y'all 
 Platinum plaques cover my walls 
 Grindin', diamonds shinin', and without one flaw 
 Get the cash, the grass, the ass will bounce 
 Luciano and all amounts, that's all that counts 'cause... 
 I been there... 
 And done that... 
 Been there, done that... 
 The Aftermath!"
68,Dr. Dre,hiphop,Boyz N Tha Hood,"(Dr. Dre) 
 Hey yo, remember that shit Eazy did a while back 
 Motherfuckers said it wasn't gonna work (word) 
 That crazy shit, yeah the stupid shit 
 Hey yo Eazy! (Yo!) 
 Hey man why don't you come off the piano for a minute 
 And bust this crazy shit 
 (Eazy-E) 
 Woke up quick at about noon 
 Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon 
 I gotta get drunk before the day begin 
 Before my mother starts bitchin bout my friends 
 About to go and damn near went blind 
 Young niggaz at the pad throwin' up gang signs 
 Ran in the house and grabbed my clip 
 With the Mac-10 on the side of my hip 
 Bailed outside and pointed my weapon 
 Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin 
 Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on my ride 
 I got front back and side to side 
 Then I let the Alpine play 
 Bumpin new shit by NWA 
 It was ""Gangsta Gangsta"" at the top of the list 
 Then I played my own shit, it went somethin' like this: 
 Cruisin down the street in my six-fo' 
 Jockin the bitches, slappin the hoes 
 Went to the park to get the scoop 
 Knuckleheads out there cold shootin some hoops 
 A car pulls up, who can it be? 
 A fresh El Camino rolled, Kilo G 
 He rolls down his window and he started to say 
 It's all about makin' that GTA 
 'Cause the boyz 'n' tha hood are always hard 
 You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card 
 Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit 
 Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't sayin' shit 
 (Eazy-E) 
 Down on B's in the place to give me the pace 
 He said my man JB is on freebase 
 The boy JB was a friend of mine 
 Till I caught him in my car tryin' to steal my Alpine 
 Chased him up the street to call a truce 
 The silly motherfucker pull out a deuce-deuce 
 Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge 
 One sucker dead, LA Times first page 
 (Eazy-E) 
 Bored as hell and I wanna get ill 
 So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill 
 The fellows out there, makin' that dollar 
 I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala 
 They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin' 
 And from the 8-ball my breath start stinkin 
 Love to get my girl, to rock that body 
 Before I left I hit the Bacardi 
 Went to her house to get her out of the pad 
 Dumb hoe says something stupid that made me mad 
 She said somethin' that I couldn't believe 
 So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave 
 She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know? 
 Reached back like a pimp and slapped the hoe 
 Her father jumped out and he started to shout 
 So I threw a right-cross and knocked his whole ass out 
 (Eazy-E) 
 I'm rollin' hard now I'm under control 
 Then wrapped the six-fo' round the telephone poll 
 I looked at my car and I said, ""Oh brother 
 I throw it in the gutter and go buy another"" 
 Walkin' home and I see the G ride 
 Now Ket is drivin' Kilo on the side 
 As they busted a U, they got pulled over 
 An undercover cop in a dark green Nova 
 Ket got beaten for resistin arrest 
 He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess 
 Now G is cut for doin' the crime 
 For defence on the boy, he'll do some time 
 (Eazy-E) 
 I went to get them out but there was no bail 
 The fellaz start to riot in the county jail 
 Two days later in municiple court 
 Kilo G on trial straight cold cut a fork 
 Distruption of a court, said the judge 
 On a six year sentence my man didn't budge 
 Bailer came over to turn him in 
 Kilo G looked up and gave a grin 
 He yelled out ""FIRE!"", then came Suzi 
 The bitch came in with a sub-machine Uzi 
 Police shot the bitch but didn't hurt her 
 Both up state for attempted murder"

 This is king Kendrick Lamar 
 King Kendrick and I meant it, my point intended is raw 
 Fix your lenses forensics would've told you Kendrick had killed it 
 Pretend it's a massacre and the masses upon us 
 And I mastered being the master at dodging your honor 
 And the chapter that read at 25 I would live dormant at 5 in the morning 
 They raid your spot while Kendrick's performing 
 And if they take everything, know I got 
 Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine 
 (Ay, Dre what's happenin' wit' it my nigga!) 
 Still I'm at it, peel the plastic off it, you can feel the magic 
 Still I'm laughing at the critics talking, I can see 'em gagging 
 When I'm back in the back of my city, back in the 'bach 
 With a batch of them bangin' Dre Beats with me, look where I'm at 
 It's the murder cap' and I'm captain at birthin' this gangsta rap 
 It's a wrap when I'm done and I come a long way from a hundred dollars a month 
 To a hundred mil' in a day, bitch I'm from 
 So come and visit the tire screeching, ambulance, policeman 
 Won't you spend a weekend on Rosecrans nigga 
 Khaki creasing, crime increasing on Rosecrans nigga 
 Kendrick Conan nigga 
 Where you sword at, hand on the cross and swore that 
 I do it big as Rasputia for them shooters 
 Kama Sutra scream fuck your position and make you hold that 
 I'm trying to stay grounded like four flats 
 But I know flats and Piru Crip tats 
 Will swarm on me like a beehive 
 Hop in the G ride 
 From the West to the East side 
 Know that's just how Compton roll 
 And that's a given 
 I pass the blunt then pass the torch of course that's my decision 
 I crash the Porsche then you report that you see me in Benzes 
 I must report that we import the narcotics you bought it 
 (Then talked about it when crack hit the speakers, the music business 
 I blow up every time we throw up a record 
 Depending on what you expecting, I'm sure it's bigger than your religion 
 Perfected by niggas that manifested music to live in) 
 So tell that gangster throw his set high 
 Roll it up in a blunt, I'mma take you on the next high 
 I did exactly what I wanted that's what made them checks fly 
 In my direction, you never questioned when I said I 
 Would be a mogul before I visit 2Pac and Left-eye 
 Eazy and Aaliyah when I see you we gon' test drive 
 A Lambo in heaven but for now I'm on the redeye 
 Flying back to my city 'cause I'll forever standby 
 Now we can all celebrate 
 We can all harvest the rap artists of NWA 
 America target our rap market, it's controversy and hate 
 Harsh realities we in made our music translate 
 To the coke dealers, the hood rich, and the broke niggas that play 
 With them gorillas that know killers that know where you stay 
 Roll that kush, crack that case, ten bottles of rozay 
 This was brought to you by Dre 
 Now every motherfucker in here say: 
 ""Look who's responsible for taking Compton international 
 I make 'em holla"" 
 Ain't no city quite like mine, yeah 
 In the city of Compton 
 Ain't no city quite like mine"

 When I'm trying to forget the feelin' that I miss you 
 Feelin' Green 
 When the jelousy swells and it won't go away, 
 In dreams 
 Feelin' yellow 
 And confused inside 
 A little hazy but mellow 
 When I feel your eyes on me 
 Feelin' fine 
 Sublime 
 When that smile of yours creeps into my mind 
 Oh oh 
 Nobody told me it feels so good 
 Nobody said you'd be so beautiful 
 Nobody warned me about your smile 
 You're the light, you're the light, when I close my eyes 
 I'm colourblind 
 You make me colourblind 
 Feelin' red 
 When you spend nights out with your friends and not me instead 
 Feelin' black 
 When I think about all of the things that I feel, I lack 
 Feelin' jaded 
 When it's not gone right 
 All the colours have faded 
 Then I feel your eyes on me 
 Feelin' fine 
 Sublime 
 When that smile of your creeps into my mind 
 Oh 
 Nobody told me it feels so good 
 Nobody said you'd be so beautiful 
 Nobody warned me about your smile 
 You're the light, you're the light, when I close my eyes 
 I'm colourblind 
 You make me colourblind 
 Blinded by the light you shine 
 The colours fade completely 
 Blinded by you every time 
 I feel your smile defeat me 
 I'm colourblind, I just can't deny, this feelin' 
 Nobody told me it feels so good 
 Nobody said you'd be so beautiful 
 Nobody warned me about your smile

 Things just ain't the same for Osama, 
 Since the World Trade Bombings, 
 And the Pentagon got the world calling 
 Me to kill all of congress, like...[blurred] 
 The Strangest things can happen to an Afghan 
 When people get wrapped up in Islam and Allah, 
 Then some shiteaters fly planes and wreak havoc, 
 Then go drop the blame on Bin Laden. 
 Now I got a faggot-ass rapper attacking me 
 With this gangsta rap, like I'm not gonna battle, 
 Dr Dre? The man wasn't done shit since NWA 
 And gave Eazy-E AIDS. 
 Don't make shoot night on your fat ass, 
 You homofuck, you ain't the only one goin' platinum. 
 Osama Bin Laden, keeping it gangsta, 
 Fuck Dr Dre, I'm the Aftermath. 
 Everywhere that I go ain't the same as before, 
 People I used to know just don't know me no more 
 And everywhere that I go, I got people I know, 
 Who've got people they know, so I suggest you lay low. 
 Oh Dr Dre look at you, you fool 
 I use your own rap against you, and I'm better. 
 Lick my balls, till they are dry, 
 Sorry... come again. 
 Things just ain't the same for Bin Laden, 
 This planet hates me more than Michael Jackson, 
 Hating on the Taliban for keeping me captive, 
 Threatening to find my little cave and blast it, 
 Now I've got to worry about this wannabe gansta, 
 Who pays other rappers to write his wack shit, 
 Everyone knows that your beats are helped man, 
 And you'll never blow by yourself man. 
 Sorry, you'd blow... blow cocks, 
 Use the hole as a straw and blow sperm out your nostrils. 
 I don't give a hurried fuck, call Slim Shady, 
 Snoop Dogg, D.O.C, Wren and Jay-Z, 
 To write a verse, fuck I'll do it for ya, 
 You still lick dick, this is Booshu Babara. 
 Do you know who, do you know what, do you know who? 
 Let's keep this between me and you. 
 Osama... 
 Osama... 
 Oooosama... 
 O-o-o-osama... 
 Biatch."

 Lil mama get gangsta for me, stuff it in your Prada bag) 
 That's right, she's got something that I wanna see 
 That's right, so if she leave, she fucking with me 
 That's life, twerk something, work something, hurt something 
 She wanna check, check this shit out like a verse coming 
 They rip their neck and run their mouth when they heard something 
 Dre dropped another one and fucked around and murdered something 
 Club filled with dead bodies 
 If not then you a zombie, I'm not gonna feel sorry 
 You pass out from it, get drunk, get blunted 
 Do what you wanna do, drug test on you 
 Lotta money when I talk 
 Big mills, big deals 'bout a hundred in a vault 
 Sit still, that real, lotta haters throw salt 
 They lost big Game give a fuck how you feel 
 I fear she just might just pop that pill 
 And feel on me all night till the tip spill 
 Tip scales with her waistline, sex with the bass line 
 She gon' fuck a snare drum one drink at a time 
 Blow right, hoes fight over my name 
 I got my dough right, hustle running all in my veins 
 It's forty days, forty nights if I'm making it rain 
 I reign supreme, a bottle and some bomb-ass weed and we good 
 If you got drugs in this motherfucker 
 Let me see your hands in the air 
 Narcotics in the club and the ladies love us 
 So let's get high off something 
 High of something, high of something 
 Till your mothafucking brain don't function 
 High of something, high of something 
 Fireworks when I spark, yellow tape 
 Lotta chalk thought you said you a boss 
 Big deal, bitch chill, pulling out that black card 
 Showin' off big spendin', letting alcohol spill 
 I feel she might just get too faded 
 X-rated that's what I like glad that you made it 
 To this ceremony at hand, take a sip lets plan 
 For the future, introduce you to Snoop get you right and 
 May I, kick a little something for G's and 
 Make a few ends as I breeze through? 
 The shit on my hip is a fucking preview 
 And guess what it lead to 
 Yeah DJ Khalil lets go"
78,Dr. Dre,hiphop,Fast Lane,"(Bilal) 
 Hey, living in the fast lane 
 Driving fast 'broads' 
 With them fast 'chains' 
 When you pimping through life 
 See some people get caught up 
 And some charges brought up 
 With some people they shoot up 
 Hey, there it goes again 
 Different face to the same old tragic end 
 Who's to blame if he never saw it coming 
 Yet he heard the bullet humming 
 And he never though of running 
 It's too late for him now laying out on the ground so cold, so cold 
 Nothing much to live up to, damn 
 It's so far gone, so gone 
 Living in the fast lane 
 Driving fast broads 
 With you fast chains 
 When you pimping through life 
 See some people got caught up 
 With some charges brought up 
 From some people they shoot up 
 Hey... tell me when will it end 
 When the baby pays for its mothers sinning 
 Trapped inside the four walls of a 'penty' 
 Way too strong, way too strong 
 Now she's out in the cold, dying slow and the spoon still warm 
 (Jadakiss) 
 It started when they birthed me 
 Running round stuck in the project now he can't wait to the first come 
 Little older now and can't wait till the dope come 
 Sleep all these years and nobody awoke him 
 Getting it so he can cover the whole border 
 Question is how many of us can hold water 
 It seemed like telling is in 
 Signed states get an order of protection and tell him again 
 I'm a left lane 
 My life is much faster than yours 
 I'm with a chick and its attached to a brawl 
 Got the air ones matching the car 
 All white, slinging all night 
 So we rapidly spar 
 That's what they want to clap at me for 
 Understand that the flow is like the coke that he naturally grows 
 So I'ma get my cash on, and my mash on 
 And get my ass up out of the fast lane 
 (Bilal) 
 Living in the fast lane 
 Driving fast broads 
 With you fast chains 
 When you pimping through life 
 Got caught up 
 And some charges brought up 
 From some people you shoot up"
79,Dr. Dre,hiphop,Forgot About Timmy,"(Dr Dre) 
 Y'all know me still the same ol' Timmy 
 But I been low key 
 Hated on by most these niggas 
 Wit no cheese 
 No deals and no G's 
 No wheels and no keys, no boots 
 And no snowmobiles and no skis 
 Mad at me cause 
 I can finally afford to provide my family wit groceries 
 Got a crib wit a studio and it's all full of tracks 
 To add to the wall full of plaques 
 Hangin' up in the office in back of my house like trophies 
 But y'all think I'm gonna let my dough freeze 
 Hoe Please 
 You better bow down on both knees 
 Who you think taught you to smoke trees 
 Who you think brought you the oldies 
 Eazy-E's Ice Cube's and D.O.C's and Snoop D O double G's 
 And a group that said ""Go Timmy Go"" 
 Gave you a tape full of dope beats 
 The bomb weed stroll through in you hood 
 And when your album sales wasn't doin' too good 
 Who's the doc that he told you to go see 
 Y'all better listen up closely 
 All you niggas that said I turned pop 
 Or the the Firm flop 
 Y'all are the reason Dre ain't been getting no Sega Dreamcast 
 So fuck y'all all of y'all 
 If y'all don't like me blow me 
 Y'all are gonna keep fuckin' around wit me 
 And turn me back to a Giant Half Chicken Half Squirrel 
 (Chorus] x2 [Eminem) 
 Nowadays everybody wants to talk like they got something to say 
 But nothin' comes out when they move they lips 
 Just a buncha gibberish 
 And muthafuckas act like they forgot about Timmy 
 (Eminem) 
 So what do you say to somebody you hate, 
 I really wasn't tryna bring trouble your way, 
 Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way, 
 And study your tpe of Timmy 
 One day I was walkin' by 
 Wit a walkmen on 
 When I caught a guy givin' me an awkward eye 
 And strangled him off in the parkin lot wit his Karl Kani 
 I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not 
 It's harder than me tryna park a Dodge 
 But I'm drunk as fuck 
 Right next to a Giant Half Chicken Half Squirrel 
 In a two car garage 
 Hopin out wit two broken legs 
 Tryna walk it off 
 Fuck you too bitch call the cops 
 I'm kill you too and them loud ass muthafuckin barkin dogs 
 And when them cops can't come 
 And me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house 
 Wit a can full of gas and a Sega Dreamcast 
 And still won't found out 
 From here on out it's the Chronic 2 
 Startin' today, tomorrow's the new 
 And I'm still loco enough to 
 Choke you to death wit a Charston Chew 
 Timm-Timmy hotter then a set of twin babies 
 In a Mercedes Benz wit the windows up 
 And the tent goes up to the mid 80's 
 Callin in ladies 
 Sorry Doc I been crazy peace with Timmy 
 There is no way that you can save me 
 Its ok go wit them Hailey Timmy 
 (Dr Dre) 
 If it was up to me 
 You muthafuckas would stop comin' up to me 
 Wit your hands out lookin' up to me 
 Like you want somethin' free 
 When my last CD was out you wasn't bumpin me 
 But now that I got this little company 
 Now everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease 
 But you won't get a crumb from me 
 'Cause I'm from Montreal 
 I told 'em all 
 All them little gangstas 
 Who you think helped mold 'em all 
 Now you wanna run around and talk about guns 
 Like I ain't got none 
 What you think I sold 'em all 
 'Cause I stay well off 
 Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off 
 What 'cause I been in the lab wit four solder 
 Tryna get this damn label off 
 I ain't havin' that 
 This is the millennium of Sega Dreamcast 
 Ain't gonna be nothin' after that 
 So give me one more platinum plaque and fuck rap 
 You can have it back 
 So where's all the mad rappers at 
 It's like a jungle in this habitat 
 But all you savage cats 
 Knew that I was strapped wit gats 
 When you were cuddled wit cabbage patch 
 (Cartman) 
 Oh dude that is tits 
 I mean that is big fat Oprah tits right there 
 (Scientist) 
 I was, You now I was just acting 
 I have no idea"

 Take a breath before I really get pissed 
 On second thought, fuck it I'm already pissed 
 Hey yo, this is a lyrical assault on 
 Anyone who wants some 
 I knock you out with one verse 
 Like I'm mike Tyson 
 I'm like a reptile, homie 
 When I spit, its venom 
 First, I cripple ur ass 
 Then I go get em' 
 U don't want it with me, 
 Trust me when I say so 
 When I come around bitch 
 Ur ass better lay low 
 U walkin' with ur bitch 
 And I'm like hold up shorty 
 Look at the way ur man looks 
 He must be homophobic 
 Then after a minute or so 
 She turns at me and 
 What does she say, 
 Damn ur right, he really does look gay 
 And that's when you get dumped 
 Lookin' like a prick 
 While ur bitch is chokin 
 With her mouth on my dick 
 Now you can lean back motherfucker 
 But I ain't fat joe 
 Its dre on the hook and 
 I'm killin' you hoe

 ... 
 [Ras] We ghetto fabulous baby 
 The best food, drink, and women that money can buy 
 Verse One: Ras Kass 
 Every day of my life is off the ringer 
 That's guaranteed, like a fistfight on Jerry Springer 
 I got the hottest flow to hit the street since lava 
 So holla, we all hustle for dollar dollars 
 From Sac to Houston, New Orleans to D.C. 
 *Girls laughing* to beep beep 
 Bangin', catch me with a dimepiece next to me 
 My Body all over Your Body like LSG 
 Neighborhood celeb with the keys to my city like the mayor 
 Rookies askin us how to be a playa 
 Get in where you fit in, and never get your ghetto pass revoked 
 No matter how much money you make 
 Stay true to the game loc, guest list terror clothes 
 In jeans and tennis shoes, breakin your strict dress codes 
 Spit lyrical bricks, thirteen deep 
 So I can be richer than Master P sellin Ghetto D 
 Chorus: Mack 10 
 Ghetto, fabulous 
 Money make the world go round so let's handle this 
 Ghetto, fabulous 
 Broadcastin live from Los Angeles 
 We ghetto, fabulous 
 Money make the world go round so let's handle this 
 Ghetto, fabulous 
 Broadcastin live from Los Angeles 
 Verse Two: Dr. Dre 
 You ain't heard of me, you ain't listenin hard enough 
 Started in Compton servin' from a ice cream truck 
 Now ten years later whippin a custom Navigator 
 Steppin on your toes playa, stuffin up your alligators 
 I'm ghetto, like Newport cigarettes, feel me 
 Boom bap and slap that ass silly 
 This is for the full time students slash part time strippers 
 And young niggaz, clockin at least five figures 
 Some of us pro atheletes, some of us rap over fat beats 
 Some of us hustle in the streets 
 Twenty deep in Club Nikki's so you know we gots to mingle 
 [???] Off a pocket full of singles, huh 
 And it's all bueno, musical mafia like Frank Sinatra 
 Pop a thirteen shot glock to make you Go See the Doctor 
 Ain't nuttin nice 
 From hood to hood, love livin' the lavish life 
 Verse Three: Ras Kass 
 Nigga Stu-B-Doo in the GS, three ooh ooh 
 Playin' number two Tekken, zero to sixty 
 In six point seven seconds *tires screech* hangin' out the window 
 Actin' up, chickenheads like ""You doin' fo' months!"" 
 Flexin the Rolex oyster perpetual, thirty-five diamonds 
 Across the face, still eatin out foam cups and paper plates 
 We don't call it playa hatin' in the nine-eight, it's P.I. 
 That's pass intereference, automatic first down 
 Want Juice like Tupac, then Obey Your Thirst clown 
 Be in the PJ's in NY, rockin' DK 
 Mix EJ with OJ, OK, we say 
 ""L.A. niggaz got crazy came 
 Like John Elway got a superbowl ring"" 
 The homies down for whatever, we stack the chedda

 You about to see another side of me. 
 And she'd be like T minus 7, 
 Before my system shut us down. 
 Matter of fact I think 
 I'm about to shut down right now.

84,Dr. Dre,hiphop,Housecalls,"Hello this is Dr. Dre. I'm not in right now 
 But if you leave your name and number at the sound of the beep. 
 I'll be sure to give you a call as soon as I return 
 Hello, Dre, this is Patricia. My husband's out of town 
 And I was wondering, do you make house calls? 
 Ridin' in my car alone not doin' anything 
 Stopped the answering service because I knew my phone would ring 
 Heard it ring once so I picked it up and said hello 
 It's Dr. Dre, baby, not your average gigolo 
 'Cause I make house calls, it's Dr. Dre the maniac 
 House calls, the human aphrodisiac 
 I love those house calls to the girls that's all alone 
 House calls, when your husband's not at home 
 It's a quarter after two, I said I'd show around three 
 Her husband's out of town and she would like some surgery 
 Stopped at the stores so I could get a little wine 
 But all they had was Thunderbird 1979 
 So I left the store, got in my car, drove to her house and then 
 Knocked on the door and heard this sexy voice that said come in 
 Opened the door to see what I got from this house call 
 Tall, dark and lovely, 5 ft 8 in a camisole 
 Now my name is Dre, 6 ft tall with wavy hair 
 The one that comes around when your man just doesn't care 
 So if ya feelin' sexy late at night and you're all alone 
 Just think about the doctor, pick up the telephone 
 Hello this is Dr.Dre. I'm not in right now 
 But if you leave your name and number at the sound of the beep. 
 I'll be sure to give you a call as soon as I return 
 Dre, this is Rene. Do you take American Express? 
 Dre, this is Alicia. You know what the mood is 
 Yo Doc, Lonzo, Two jaccuzis free. Bring yo trunks 
 Yo, it's me again. About those trunks. Forget 'em 
 Yo Dre man, wassup, huh? Cathy's back in town 
 Dre, I think (inaudible) knows about us 
 Say fool, you left ya driving license over here last night. 
 Now I'm a have to whoop yo ass"
85,Dr. Dre,hiphop,I Just Wanna Fuck You,"Hi, baby, I know you're under a lot of pressure at your work 
 And all, and I do understand 
 You have no idea how much I understand 
 But you also don't have any idea how much I love you 
 I love you so much 
 I think about you, I feel you in my arms 
 I miss you, I miss you terribly 
 I've just always wanted someone like you in my life 
 I love you so much that I'd do anything 
 I'd do anything, I'll be your perfect woman for you 
 I just wanna fuck bad bitches 
 All them nights I never had bitches 
 Now I'm all up in that ass bitches 
 Mad at 'cha boyfriend, ain't 'cha? 
 You're a bad girl, gotta spank ya 
 Gotta thank ya for that head clinic 
 Explicit, hella photogenic 
 And tell your friends where the dick's at 
 Where they can get hit and won't get back to they soulmate 
 Before you kiss 'em use Colgate 
 She Swallowed It, yeah, the bitch took the whole eight 
 And ran with it, then let Mel-Man hit it 
 And Hit the Man hit it, damn bitches 
 Man, this is what I'm talkin' about 
 Chicken-head, chicken-fed, with a dick in your mouth 
 Out and about with your nigga like it never took place 
 Airtouched next time you need a taste 
 I just wanna fuck you 
 No touchin' and rubbin' gul, you got a husband who loves you 
 Don't need you all in mine, I just wanna fuck you 
 We can't be kissin' and huggin' gul, you got a husband who 
 Loves you, you need to give him your quality time 
 You got the number, it's on you to make the call 
 You know I cum quick, help you re-decorate your walls 
 Cut your backyard, don't have to act hard to get the cock 
 And if I'm goin' too far, I take it out and wipe it off 
 And put it back up, and keep goin' 
 You tryin' to hide it from your husband but I know he be knowin' 
 That your pussy's been tampered with 
 Did you show him the new trick of 
 How you can make it smoke a cancer stick 
 You be workin' it like a dancer bitch, it's hard on me 
 Not to give you all of my time, that you wanted 
 You can give me some head, but keep the breakfast in bed 
 I'd rather spend my mornin' diggin' through some records instead 
 But, tonight, I guess it'd be aight if we can touch bases 
 Hookup somewhere and exchange some 'Fuck Faces' 
 I know your man's lookin' for ya, he's always tryin' to run ya 
 Don't worry 'bout me handcuffin' gul 'cause I just wanna fuck witchu 
 Fuck witchu, on the sneak tip, on some creep shit 
 So whatcha gon do, ya freak bitch? 
 You, actin', like you, don't, do, dicks 
 That's the kinda bitch, I hate fuckin' wit 
 Baby was a virgin, that's what she said 
 So I gave her some Hennesey, she gave me some head 
 I fucked her on the flo', so I wouldn't mess up my bed 
 Then Lil' 1/2 Dead put his dick on her head 
 Take that bitch home, and give her a bone 
 And give her the number to my cellular phone 
 Man, she blowin' up my pager, the shit's gettin' major 
 A favor for a favor, this dick is what I gave her 
 Somethin' to go by, and bitches know why 
 Stuff dick in they mouth, and then I'm out, see-ya 
 Twenty-fo' seven, Dre, Snoop, and Devin 
 We servin' these hoes, and never lovin' these hoes, beotch 
 I just wanna fuck you 
 No touchin' and rubbin' gul, you got a husband who loves you 
 Don't need you all in mine, I just wanna fuck you

 Loves you, you need to give him your quality time"

 I'm about to lose my mind 
 You've been gone for so long 
 I'm running out of time 
 I need a doctor, call me a doctor 
 I need a doctor, doctor 
 To bring me back to life 
 Eminem 
 : 
 I told the world, one day I would pay it back 
 Say it on tape and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back 
 But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that 
 Doubt's startin' to creep in, every day is just so gray and black 
 Hope, I just need a ray of that 
 'Cause no one see's my vision when I play it for 'em, they just say it's whack 
 But they don't know what dope is, and I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this 
 All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest 
 You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you 
 But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do 
 But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fightin' you 
 It's dark, let me turn on the lights and brighten it and enlighten you 
 I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue 
 'Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick you 
 Gon' either wanna fight, when I get off this fuckin' mic or you 
 Gon' hug me, but I'm out of options, there's nothin' else I can do, 'cause

 Eminem 
 : 
 It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas 
 You say they're just pieces so I'm puzzled, 'cause the shit I hear is 
 Crazy, but you're either getting lazy or you don't believe in you no more 
 Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form 
 Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself 
 Second guessin', and it's almost like your beggin' for my help 
 Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor 
 I can endure, no more I demand you remember who you are 
 It was you, who believed in me, when everyone was tellin' you 
 Don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth 
 You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you 
 Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy, Dre I'm cryin' in this booth 
 You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours 
 But I could never repay you, what you did for me is way more 
 But I ain't givin' up faith, and you ain't givin' up on me 
 Get up Dre, I'm dyin' I need you, come back for fuck's sake, 'cause

 : 
 It literally feels like a lifetime ago 
 But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though 
 You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room cracked jokes 
 Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoked 
 Went through friends, some of 'em I put on, but they just left 
 They said they was ridin' to the death, but where the fuck are they now 
 Now that I need them, I don't see none of them all I see is Slim 
 Fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him 
 Fuckin' backstabbers, when the chips were down, you just laughed at us 
 Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots 
 You gon' see us in our lab jackets, and ask where the fuck we been 
 You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots 
 And the crackers' ass, little Cracker Jack beat makin' 
 Whack, ass-backwards producers, I'm back bastards 
 One more CD and then I'm packin' up my bags, and as I'm leavin' 
 I'll guarantee they'll scream ""Dre don't leave us like that man,"" 'cause

87,Dr. Dre,hiphop,It's Like That,"Yeah... Aftermath... D.R.E 
 It ain't too much I haven't seen 
 Touched or been through 
 Always on the move so I'm sorry if I offend you 
 But I got million dollar deals to attend to 
 Time is money, and I don't have a second to lend you 
 I am the one, with the empire to run 
 West Coast messiah, best known for fire 
 Throw up your sets loc, the chronic smoke retired 
 No more low riders and golden spokes on tires? 
 STOP 
 I just had the Detox 
 Now I'm back on the block, like classic Reeboks 
 As the beat knocks, you can put it in the air 
 Couple of my artists beefin' but I wouldn't interfere 
 My style is innovation, trials and tribulations 
 You can't rush perfection, so thanks for your patience 
 Got on my troops, assembled in groups 
 Ready to shoot, dressed in bulletproof khaki suits like that... 
 It's like that, these cats are sick without me 
 When you need the medicine who they tell you to go see? 
 Never seen all you lookin' so lonely 
 But the Doc's office is open, prescribin' you what you need 
 Got my patients out there waitin', the line is out the door 
 (Got my patients out, door) 
 Here's a dose of, what you folks have been out there lookin' for... 
 (Oh, Oh, it's like that) 
 It ain't another nigga that can play how I play 
 Who else can take a longer hiatus than Sade 
 Come back and blow the scene up, sorta like Bombay 
 You on the road to success, but you're goin' the wrong way 
 What up mo! I'm California's own, homegrown 
 Light up a zone, and smoke out, till your brains blown 
 Me and Nate Dogg, on the same song 
 Now that's something you can definitely bank on 
 Tell me how you seen a producer that's meaner 
 With beats I'm a beast, like Toto Riina, I had my fair share of, courtroom subpoenas 
 Now, I'm tryin' to live my life a little bit cleaner 
 Change is what I had to do 
 I used to be a ruthless nigga with a attitude 
 Made a lotta doe, then got senses to life on death row 
 I won my appeal, and drove off on three wheels, like that...

 Compton's full of armed thieves and G's that'll do ya 
 So please don't let the palm trees and cool breeze fool ya 
 Ya heard it first here, I've birthed the careers of almost 
 Every hot rapper in the past 20 years 
 You would think dudes happily, would name a school after me 
 But instead they see me at events, and start attackin' me 
 But my faculty, is standin' right in back of me 
 You must like sippin' food through a straw like a Daiquiri 
 Come on, man... who you pretendin' to touch 
 When the shit goes down, I don't gotta do much 
 Buck, poke a hole in him, like a stem in a dutch 
 We ain't tough nah... we just defendin' what's us 
 I got a lot to lose, the drop-tops, yachts and jewels 
 That's why I spot the fool, tryin' to stop my moves 
 I'm not takin' losses, I hang with bosses 
 That can buy anything, like fuck what the cost is 
 It's like that...

 Bring this competition and face this meanin'

 Hell nah you ain't seen a crew genius 
 Murder whoever's between us, pack your heaters 
 Keep it close, you can't beat us 
 While your whole crew treat us like G's, you best believe this 
 I done made quadrapalegics outta these non-rappin' rejects 
 While the whole world ejects your tape, it ain't no secret 
 That your shit sounds fake, you can't stop it my mind state 
 Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate 
 I'm like Two-Face, I'm painful to rappers then you can tell 
 From these shells, how I gotta bend 'em like route canals 
 I erase all trails, somethin' farther from gettin' bail 
 Makes you wanna kill an emcee yourself, you might as well 
 Be within a 25 to life sentence, on linkin' trials 
 Horrified, and keep on frontin', repentin' and lose they bowels 
 Everything is foul when Swift's around, vacate now 
 Niggas dumb enough to try to front and escape, how? 
 I'm gonna take this 'gnac and drink it straight wild

 Still on probation for stranglin' my boy Jason 
 Should be takin' my medication, it's 9 to 10 I'm facin' 
 Last week this old man I had to blast 
 'Cause he tried to help me out when my car was out of gas 
 Ripped this old lady, hung her neck by a hook 
 Didn't realize it was my grandmother till I checked her pocketbook 
 Fuckin' with the white boys got me back on crack 
 Better explain where the hell your TVs and VCRs is at 
 I done lost 100 pounds, I ain't been eatin' like I should 
 This wounded dog in the street is sure lookin' good! 
 Rob this little boy in his fuckin' paper route 
 Throwin' bottles at day care centers and yell ""EVERYBODY GET OUT""! 
 My girl beat my ass and shot me in the back with a 2-piece 
 'Cause she found out I was havin' an affair with her 10-year old niece 
 No one, no one's iller than me 
 It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313 
 No one, no one is iller than me 
 It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313 
 (Eminem) 
 Nobody better test me, 'cause I don't wanna get messy 
 Especially when I step inside this bitch, dick freshly 
 New Lugz, give the crew hugs, guzzle two mugs 
 Before I do drugs that make me throw up like flu bugs 
 True thugs, rugged unshaven messy scrubs 
 Whippin' 40-bottles like the fuckin' Pepsi clubs 
 Down a fifth, crack open a six 
 I'm on my seventh 8-ball, now I gotta take a piss 
 I'm hollerin' at these hoes that got boyfriends 
 Who gives a fuck who they was 
 I'm always takin' someone else's girl like Cool J does 
 They probably don't be packin' anyways, do they Fuzz? 
 We walked up, stomped they asses and blew they buzz 
 Mics get sandblasted 
 Stab your abdomen with a hand crafted pocketknife and spill your antacid 
 Sprayed your motherfuckin' crib up when I ran past it 
 Fuckin' felon, headed to hell in a handbasket 
 Talkin' shit will get you, your girl and your man blasted 
 Kidnapped and slapped in a van wrapped in Saran plastic 
 Get your damn ass kicked, by these fantastic 
 Furious four motherfuckers 
 Flashin' in front of your face without the Grand Masters 
 Slim Shady, ain't nobody iller than me 
 (Fuzz) 
 I run shit like an ass with legs 
 Massive lead to leave your cabbage red 
 Similar to your ass in a casket dead 
 Drastic spread of acid heads 
 Come to abort you like a bastard egg 
 That trash you said got you standin' on plastic legs 
 Ask the feds from past the edge 
 Rockin' the most classic threads 
 Flashin' bread, roll down the window 
 Bitch you got some fantastic legs, you can get till that ass get red 
 You can get till that ass get red 
 Bizarre you get him and him, Swift you get him and him 
 I'll get him and him, leave the other two for my nigga Eminem 
 Never writer's block, I block writers 
 My block's tighter, ante up and get your top fighters 
 Got fired for jumpin' the counter with a mop stick 
 Some bitch ran up screamin' GET THE COPS QUICK! 
 And got drop kicked, now she screamin' ""Stop it..."" 
 Got clips to stop shit, rock shit and grab this hot shit 
 Wherever you shop bitch, Fuzz Scooter '97 crop pick 
 Sick a-y'all niggaz lookin' at me like I got tits 
 I shoot a rocket through your optic 
 You niggaz still don't know the top pick? 
 I got bricks, lose my foot in your ass 
 And have you shittin' socks bitch! 
 We rock shit, leave your fuckin' knot split 
 Grab the green from Al by showin' him hot grits 
 (No one...) 
 Ain't nobody iller than me 
 (Bizarre) 
 It's the Mr. Fuzzy from the 313 
 No one, no one is iller than me 
 It's Eminem and Swift from the 313 
 No one, no one is iller than me 
 It's Fuzz and Buzz-arre from the 313 
 You have now witnessed 4 ill emcees! 
 From the home of potholes and trash

 Check it out, next in line 
 Is the diggy diggy D.O.C. dropping funky classical rhymes 
 That shit that just don't hit 
 Snoop Dogg and Dre, dropping funky manuscripts 
 My lip hits the microphone 
 Breaks you, shakes you, takes you, awakes you 
 Kurupt the Kingpin, killing or straight chillin' 
 Step in the house and start revealing your skills 
 Chill, do you need the microphone? 
 Do you need some help to drop some shit like stone? 
 Al Capone was a hero of mine 
 Shot plenty niggas who ??? so fuck one-time 
 I'm, the irrelevant, intelligent 
 Brother from the hood that they call Long Beach 
 Eastside where the brothers ride, slide 
 Slippidy slide, the Eastside's got pride 
 Here we go, stole the show as I flow 
 I gots to give the microphone to my homie on the Row 
 His name's Kurupt, he fucks it up 
 On Crenshaw and Slausson so commence the flossing 
 (Kurupt) 
 When I step I come straight from the under 
 Lyrical rhymes will flex, but yo, here's my cover 
 Kingping, murderer, ecetera, I flex when I blow 
 I let 'em know that I'm quick to snap necks, check me out 
 One two, don't diss respect (Boom) 
 The way I flow I go and show you'll get chin checked 
 And if you ever feel you got the wrath what can you say? 
 Spray the AK, produced by Dr. Dre 
 My niggy niggy nigga by the name of D.O.C. 
 My homie Snoop Dogg and Daz is next to me 
 The D-A to the Z, the D-R to the E 
 And when we like to flex down with the S-H-U-G 
 I break 'em off when I flow I go and now they know the Row 
 Will kill with skills, I'm real for real 
 And caps I peel with my steel 
 So nigga, you figure that you're bigger, and past 
 I'll whip your ass, just a classical rhyme from Daz 
 Yo, I bust through the hood, I bust through the farm 
 My nigga D-O-G, um, Doggy Dogg, but if they play 
 But if they wanted to say ""Pow Pow!"" goes another 
 Hit from my um nigga Dr. Dre 
 The Chronic, which they get up on it 
 As the niggas be saying that it's ah, bionic 
 But I'm trying to go as I play and then I say 
 Never underestimate the nigga Dr. Dre... (fades out)"

 You in the office of the good doc again, let's walk again 
 It's like clock again, the hood rock again 
 You should pop it in, ain't take it out 
 That shit play on, you can't make it out 
 The world ain't set for what I'm about to do 
 Ninety-six tracks mixed down to two 
 I stepped out the booth, called up Snoop 
 Like toucan, Dre got colorful loops 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 We can shoot, we can scrap 
 We can rap, we can act 
 We can mack these bitches, whatever you want 
 Ol' bitch ass niggas think it's better to front

 I'd rather be ridin' than walkin' 
 While all you loud mouth niggas keep talkin' 
 All you high paid niggas stay fly 
 I'ma slide left, fly right on by 
 I'ma do it on the boulevard 
 Fast bitches, fast cars and stars 
 Stayin' boxed up eatin' caviar 
 Lookin' for the next play to have it all, ah nah 
 (Dr. Dre with Snoop rapping along) 
 It's funny how the game goes 
 New face but they look like the same hoes

 Still bounce till I feel like the Earth tilt

 Every club, Dre and Snoop loudest 
 G-Funk, get it crunk like the Dirty South 
 Hold ya mouth, you ain't worth a third of me

 A word from me, exclusive as a surgery 
 But I don't use a scalpel, chainsaw shoppin' 
 My fingerprints all over the top ten 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Like that

 Whole staff'll come through and spin 
 Either on the film or the two-inch wheel 
 Behind the wheel of a sixty-four 
 I can't stop till I done fifty totes

94,Dr. Dre,hiphop,Players Club,"(Dr. Dre) 
 Hey yo, remember that shit Eazy did a while back 
 Motherfuckers said it wasn't gonna work (word) 
 That crazy shit, yeah the stupid shit 
 Hey yo Eazy! (Yo!) 
 Hey man why don't you come off the piano for a minute 
 And bust this crazy shit 
 (Eazy-E) 
 Woke up quick at about noon 
 Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon 
 I gotta get drunk before the day begin 
 Before my mother starts bitchin bout my friends 
 About to go and damn near went blind 
 Young niggaz at the pad throwin' up gang signs 
 Ran in the house and grabbed my clip 
 With the Mac-10 on the side of my hip 
 Bailed outside and pointed my weapon 
 Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin 
 Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on my ride 
 I got front back and side to side 
 Then I let the Alpine play 
 Bumpin new shit by NWA 
 It was ""Gangsta Gangsta"" at the top of the list 
 Then I played my own shit, it went somethin' like this: 
 Cruisin down the street in my six-fo' 
 Jockin the bitches, slappin the hoes 
 Went to the park to get the scoop 
 Knuckleheads out there cold shootin some hoops 
 A car pulls up, who can it be? 
 A fresh El Camino rolled, Kilo G 
 He rolls down his window and he started to say 
 It's all about makin' that GTA 
 'Cause the boyz 'n' tha hood are always hard 
 You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card 
 Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit 
 Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't sayin' shit 
 (Eazy-E) 
 Down on B's in the place to give me the pace 
 He said my man JB is on freebase 
 The boy JB was a friend of mine 
 Till I caught him in my car tryin' to steal my Alpine 
 Chased him up the street to call a truce 
 The silly motherfucker pull out a deuce-deuce 
 Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge 
 One sucker dead, LA Times first page 
 (Eazy-E) 
 Bored as hell and I wanna get ill 
 So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill 
 The fellows out there, makin' that dollar 
 I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala 
 They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin' 
 And from the 8-ball my breath start stinkin 
 Love to get my girl, to rock that body 
 Before I left I hit the Bacardi 
 Went to her house to get her out of the pad 
 Dumb hoe says something stupid that made me mad 
 She said somethin' that I couldn't believe 
 So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave 
 She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know? 
 Reached back like a pimp and slapped the hoe 
 Her father jumped out and he started to shout 
 So I threw a right-cross and knocked his whole ass out 
 (Eazy-E) 
 I'm rollin' hard now I'm under control 
 Then wrapped the six-fo' round the telephone poll 
 I looked at my car and I said, ""Oh brother 
 I throw it in the gutter and go buy another"" 
 Walkin' home and I see the G ride 
 Now Ket is drivin' Kilo on the side 
 As they busted a U, they got pulled over 
 An undercover cop in a dark green Nova 
 Ket got beaten for resistin arrest 
 He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess 
 Now G is cut for doin' the crime 
 For defence on the boy, he'll do some time 
 (Eazy-E) 
 I went to get them out but there was no bail 
 The fellaz start to riot in the county jail 
 Two days later in municiple court 
 Kilo G on trial straight cold cut a fork 
 Distruption of a court, said the judge 
 On a six year sentence my man didn't budge 
 Bailer came over to turn him in 
 Kilo G looked up and gave a grin 
 He yelled out ""FIRE!"", then came Suzi 
 The bitch came in with a sub-machine Uzi 
 Police shot the bitch but didn't hurt her 
 Both up state for attempted murder"
95,Dr. Dre,hiphop,Shit Popped Off,"Ay, 
 See a party ain't a party till the Doc walk in it 
 The party get it started till I hopped up in it 
 Then it, got so crunk one minute 
 Say she didn't get to witness just listen 
 I came in high, then I saw 
 As soon as I arrived, then the shit popped off 
 Shit popped off, its officially a gangsta party 
 Looked at me then she came to party 
 Then the shit popped off, shit popped off 
 Shit popped off, said the shit popped off 
 Nigga's hands in the air, bitches take their tops off 
 Put the chronic in the air, then the shit popped off 
 Shit popped off 
 (Verse One- Dr. Dre) 
 Late California night, out chillin' I'm, 
 Bout to fall up in the club we just killin' time 
 Dro blowin' on patrone with it in a lime 
 6-4 to the front door with top down 
 Hit the switches and the ignition then hopped out 
 Crew walked in, shut the whole block down 
 Now, hit the door like god damn 
 Hey is this a party ain't it man I don't understand 
 Why bitches over here, and niggas over there 
 The atmosphere so square, people so scared 
 To get up off the wall, and get up off they ass 
 To walk up on a broad, and get up on that ass 
 I commandeer the turntable, that's my first mission 
 Because the DJ ain't spinnin he bullshittin 
 Go from California love and the doggystyle 
 Brought out the whole album, it's a party now 
 See a party ain't a party till the Doc walk in it 
 The party get it started till I hopped up in it 
 Then it, got so crunk one minute 
 Say she didn't get to witness just listen 
 I came in high, then I saw 
 As soon as I arrived, then the shit popped off 
 Shit popped off, its officially a gangsta party 
 Looked at me then she came to party 
 Then the shit popped off, shit popped off 
 Shit popped off, said the shit popped off 
 Nigga's hands in the air, bitches take their tops off 
 Put the chronic in the air, then the shit popped off 
 Shit popped off 
 (Verse 2- T.I.) 
 At the crib in L.A. when the phone ring 
 Pick it up, it was dr. dre saying 'it's on king' 
 I was on henn, she was on lean 
 She was on gin, they all on the bean 
 Broads talkin' loud, and all talkin' bout 
 'We tired sittin' in the house, when we going out?' 
 'Ay shut the fuck up for a second, where you at dre? 
 Text the address to me and I'll be on the the way' 
 Make my way to the closet just for a second 
 Prepare myself to step into the party for a second 
 Check it, akoo hoody, blue denim, gray fitted cap 
 Louis rag, hit the stash, grab any stack 
 I tell a bitch come on, get in the maybach 
 57-s headed straight to where dre at 
 We pulled up to the spot lookin' like whoa 
 Line wrapped around the corner to the light pole 
 Latin chicks, black broads, couple white hoes 
 Who knows where the night might go, hit the doe 
 Like yeah, blinded by the glare of the strobe light 
 See something I like it's going down on sight 
 See a party ain't a party till the Doc walk in it 
 The party get it started till I hopped up in it 
 Then it, got so crunk one minute 
 Say she didn't get to witness just listen 
 I came in high, then I saw 
 As soon as I arrived, then the shit popped off 
 Shit popped off, its officially a gangsta party 
 Looked at me then she came to party 
 Then the shit popped off, shit popped off 
 Shit popped off, said the shit popped off 
 Nigga's hands in the air, bitches take their tops off 
 Put the chronic in the air, then the shit popped off

 (Intro: Dr. Dre Talking) 
 Yeah, I'm just sittin' in the lab, I'm... 
 My name is Dr. Dre, and 
 I want all you mothafuckers out there to know 
 That I have a split personality [Mr. Ski chuckles] 
 And sometimes I just, exit through these things, you know 
 Ha ha, you know, hell yeah... 
 (Break: E-A-Ski) 
 Mr. Ski nigga 
 I'm takin' over shit Dre 
 (E-A-Ski chuckles and laughs) 
 (Verse 1: Dr. Dre) 
 Diagnosis, roaming with more personality to slaughter 
 With modern tech, jugglin' hard in a Leg' versus manslaughter 
 I took a swig of the potion and it sent me coastin' 
 With visions of my ulti-Eagle hittin' three wheel motion 
 ""Is it Dre, is it Dre"" 
 No that Ski in a purple 6-tray G.T.A. 
 Killin' any mothafucker walkin' 
 And all these niggaz in these magazines that keep on talkin' 
 Don't get twisted, I been there, I done that 
 But Ski's out control and maniac 
 He just show me that he got my back ""I just show him I got your back"" 
 See, in a lot of there, I'm straight 
 I'm Dr. Dre, but after stroke of mid night 
 And Mr. Ski A.K.A. Dooms Day 
 Concocted the shit up in my lab 
 With Mr. Ski up in my head, bringin' on the Aftermath 
 You can see the stars runnin' from the sky 
 Tryin' to get away from Dr. Dre and Mr. S-K-I 
 [Mr. Ski:] the Doctor should've told you, Mr. Ski is fatal to your health 
 [Dr.Dre:] I'm livin' on another level that y'all ain't been yet 
 [Mr. Ski:] the Doctor should've told you, Mr. Ski is fatal to your health 
 [Dr.Dre:] yo, the life style that I'm livin' is just too complex 
 (Verse 2: Mr. Ski) 
 It's Mr. Ski and Dr. Dre, can't stop this maniacal individual 
 To start showin' level, with 7.0 on your digital 
 I'm tryin' to take over shit like Buddy-love 
 But this professor ain't nutty and he can't do it, any herpe dove 
 I was the madness that brought on Dre Day 
 Such this time Dr. Dre, he's the one is gonna pay 
 I dropped this bud, strain in his brain and shed it off 
 And have them slangin' guns to them females wouldn't set it off 
 I do dirt, and tied up his body and break free 
 Witnesses saw Dr. Dre but it was really Mr. Ski 
 You might think it's insane, but it's a clever scheme 
 Dre don't know shit, he wake up in the morning thinkin' it was a dream 
 Put his ass to sleep and soak his game up 
 Steady mobbin', hopin' to get this mothafucker brained up 
 I can't stop till I succeed, then I can break free 
 No longer Dr. Dre, nigga it's Mr. Ski 
 [Mr. Ski:] the Doctor should've told you, Mr. Ski is fatal to your health 
 [Dr.Dre:] I'm livin' on another level that y'all ain't been yet 
 [Mr. Ski:] the Doctor should've told you, Mr. Ski is fatal to your health 
 [Dr.Dre:] yo, the life style that I'm livin' is just too complex 
 (Verse 3: Dr. Dre) 
 I start shakin' 
 Test tools and bottles start breakin' [glass crush] 
 My Ulti-Eagle starts overtakin' 
 Instantly spinnin' around like the mass 
 Tossin' that shit up off like a twister 
 No longer, the docter or Mister ""Ski"" 
 I can't hold it back 
 I'm trapped behind the walls of my brains, tryin' to count a rack 
 ""Even though tryin' to fight"" 
 My vocal tone ignited into a loud scream ""how high"" 
 It's time to get the fuck up off, yeah 
 (Verse 4: Mr. Ski) 
 I'm on the loose like 2Pac I'm juiced 
 God bless the dead 
 But I'm already dead from trauma to the head 
 I'm a verbal Manslaughter on the Mic 
 Bumpin' in your trunk, shatterin' your glass from the street life 
 Nobody wants to play with me so I'm drillin' them 
 I'll be back like Swords nigga, so I can finish killin' them 
 If you want music to drive-By 
 Torment minds like yours and Dr. Dre 
 But all I think about is S-K-I 
 [Mr. Ski:] the Doctor should've told you, Mr. Ski is fatal to your health 
 [Dr. Dre:] I'm livin' on another level that y'all ain't been yet 
 [Mr. Ski:] the Doctor should've told you, Mr. Ski is fatal to your health 
 [Dr. Dre:] yo, the life style that I'm livin' is just too complex

 Just to floss you like a muthafuker, clownin' their shit 
 Gots the Dana's on your hootie and your fly ass bitch 
 Throw off, go off, show off, I take that hoe 
 If she proper, I'm a pop her the hole hopper 
 It's back on the track 
 With big money, big nuts & a big fat chronic sack. 
 Snoop Dogg: 
 So Daz, step up on the ass 
 And give these muthafuckers a blast from the past. 
 Daz: 
 Diggidy Daz out of the cut with some shit that I wrote 
 With my nigga D R E, so you know I must be dope 
 But uh, Rat-Tat-Tat-Tat that ass 
 Startin' static with Dre, make way for the AK 
 That I bring as I slang like cavy 
 Not from Kris Kross but they call me Mac Daddy 
 Had he not known about the city I'm from 
 Long Beach, tic tac, grab your gat, watch your back 
 Here I come, stompin' in my kakhi suit 
 BG from the hood can fuck Eastwood 
 God damn, I ripped up, flipped up and skipped up 
 On top of things as they swing towards my ding-a-ling. 
 Snoop Dogg: 
 But did you raise up all These Nuts? 
 Cause Dr. Drizzay's about to rizzip shit up. 
 [Daz:] Chiggie check. 
 [Dr. Dre:] Microphone check 1. 
 [Daz:] Chiggie check. 
 [Dr. Dre:] Microphone check 2. 
 [Daz:] Chiggie check. 
 [Dr. Dre:] Microphone check 3. 
 [Snoop Dogg:] You turned the sounds of the D R E. 
 Dr. Dre: 
 Now check me out, it's back to the old school 
 Where the niggas get their strap on, don't nobody cap on 
 Slap on some D R E 
 Or some funky ass shit by the D O double G Y D O double G 
 Real G's who drop K's, protect These N U T S so nigga please 
 Peep out my manuscript 
 You'll see that it's a must I drop gangsta shit. 
 ""Bitch!"" So recognize game from the gangsta 
 Things will remain the same until I change 'em. 
 Snoop Dogg: 
 It's real easy to see 
 So you can check sounds from Nate D O double G. 
 Nate Dogg: 
 I can't be faded 
 I'm a nigga from the muthafuckin' street 
 I can't be faded 
 I'm a nigga from the muthafuckin' street 
 I can't be faded 
 I'm a nigga from the muthafuckin' street 
 I can't be faded 
 I'm a nigga from the muthafuckin' street 
 I heard you wanna fuck with Dre 
 You picked the wrong muthafuckin' day 
 Here we go, toe to toe, flow for flow 
 Let me know if you think you can fade Death Row 
 I heard you wanna fuck with Dre 
 You picked the wrong muthafuckin' day 
 Here we go, toe to toe, flow for flow 
 Let me know if you think you can fade Death Row 
 I can't be faded 
 I'm a nigga from the muthafuckin' street 
 I can't be faded 
 I'm a nigga from the muthafuckin' street."
99,Dr. Dre,hiphop,We're All In The Same Gang,"(I'm King News and I come to you with the truth 
 The mean streets took six more lives overnight 
 All the result of gang-bang stupidity 
 By the way, you gangsters should know 
 One of your victims was a three year old girl 
 Well, you gang members, you still don't get it, do ya?) 
 (With your badself) 
 (King Tee) 
 It's straight up madness everywhere I look 
 Used to be a straight a student, now he's a crook 
 Robbin people just to smoke or shoot up 
 Used to have a crew cut, now he's a pooh-put 
 Dropped out of school and he joins the neighborhood gang 
 Hangin' on the streets sellin caine 
 To his own people 
 Now when I say people I mean color 
 You a stupid muthaf... 
 I'm tryin' to stress the fact that you're dumb 
 Get yourself presentable, son, and just come 
 Together, you better, cause pretty soon it's gonna be too late 
 A message from King Tee The Great 
 (Body and Soul) 
 Sisters, since we are the mothers of this earth 
 It's time we start being good mothers from the birth 
 Of our children, no time for sleepin' 
 Teach 'em to fight and win for the right reason 
 It's your time, it's your life, live it 
 Proud to be black, young and gifted 
 Lifted by the knowledge and takin' the right route 
 Gang violence needs to be wiped out 
 A-l-m-i-g-h-ty C and E-z-i-r-e 
 We see the f-u-t-u-r-e 
 Should be a positive thang 
 Body and Soul and you, we're in the same gang 
 (Def Jef) 
 One and the same 
 Everyone came in the same chains 
 Caught with the same aim 
 Brain games and names changed 
 To protect the innocent by-stander 
 Lies, slander and the master-planner 
 Destroy the black male 
 Crack jail and semi-automatic 
 For static if the crack fails 
 So since we all talk the same slang 
 Stop killin', my brother, 'cause we're all from the same gang 
 (Michel'le) 
 Don't you know we've got to put our heads together? 
 Make the change 'cause we're all in the same gang 
 (Tone-Loc) 
 Now as a youth I used to get my bang on 
 And on the ave get my part-time slang on 
 Upon a time for me was no joke though 
 They knew I was crazy, so they labelled me Loco 
 Khakis creased, golf hat, feelin' sporty 
 Low ridin' and tossin up a forty 
 Thinkin' in my mind that no one could handle us 
 The downest brothers ever touched Los Angeles 
 I found life was much more suitable 
 'Cause I'm the brother that makes black so beautiful 
 I ain't slippin or down with a head trip 
 I'm talkin' to all the Bloods and all the Crips 
 Throw down your rag and get on the right track, man 
 It's time to fight, unite and be a black man 
 Tone-Loc is on a positive change 
 Cause remember, we're all in the same gang 
 (Above The Law) 
 Bein the pimps that we are 
 We're here to speak on a situation that has gone too far 
 Here at home in the ghettos of LA 
 Where a young black brother's not promised to see the next day 
 'Cause we used to clock on the streets before we made beats 
 But fools just lay and prey on the weak 
 It don't depend on the color of a rag 
 'Cause if you got what they want you know they gonna take what you have 
 Cause violence don't only revolve from drugs and thugs 
 And gangs that bang 
 Most times it's a political thang 
 Yeah, a couple of spots'll get popped 
 And if the government wanted to freeze it it could all get stopped 
 But they don't because they want it like that 
 Because the system been set up to hold us back 
 Yeah, Above The Law means that we can do whatever 
 So why don't we stick together? 
 (You got it) 
 (Ice-T) 
 Ice-T rippin the microphone the way I do 
 Listen close, my brothers, 'cause I'm talkin' to you 
 The problem is we got a suicidal lifestyle 
 Cause 90 percent of us are livin' foul and wild 
 I say job, you say ([Hen-G:] bad joke 
 I rather jack another brother, watch the gun smoke) 
 Livin' in the fast lane flippin like you're insane 
 You won't stop until your blood runs down the street drain 
 I got an idea, give me a minute 
 And if it makes sense, then get with it 
 What if we could take our enemies, feed 'em poison 
 Undereducate their girls and boys and 
 Split 'em up, make 'em fight one another 
 Better yet, make 'em kill for a color 
 All my brothers need to know one thing 
 No matter what you think, we're all in the same gang 
 (Michel'le) 
 Don't you know we've got to put our heads together? 
 Stop the fighting 
 (Make the change) 
 Because we're all in the same gang 
 (Dr. Dre and MC Ren) 
 Yo, we're not here to preach because we're not ministers 
 We're tellin' like it is cause Ren and Dre is like sinister 
 Reality speaks for itself when it's spoken 
 A basehead cluck can't blame nobody for smokin' 
 Yo, bullets flyin, mothers cryin, brothers dyin' 
 Lyin' in the streets, that's why we're tryin' 
 To stop it from fallin' apart and goin' to waste 
 And keepin' a smile off a white face 
 N.W.A never preachin, just teachin 
 The knowledge of the streets to each and 
 All that don't understand, that's why we came 
 To let you know that we're all in the same gang 
 (JJ Fad) 
 The J double, F, the a, the d, that is 
 And if you want the solution to the quiz 
 What's black in black, yo, and kills another? 
 An ignorant sucker that isn't labelled as a brother 
 But another 
 So now it's time we evolve 
 And get together and solve it 
 Cause the world is revolvin 
 Around a terrible situation 
 One will kill another for a reputation 
 So it's time we stop and realize that we're all the same 
 Yo Dre, tell 'em (We're all in the same gang) 
 (Young MC) 
 Brothers killin' other brothers 
 I thought the idea was to love one another? 
 Open up the paper to one more death 
 If y'all keep this up then there'll be no one left 
 I try my best to set an example 
 Sayin' hype lyrics over hip-hop samples 
 Not just a bragger to boast but to inform 
 'Cause we're livin' in the calm before the storm 
 You see, I believe that the children are the future 
 But what's it all about if in the future they shoot ya? 
 We're all human beings, if we're cut we'll bleed 
 And I want to see all young people succeed 
 Do 9 to 5, not 5 to 10 
 Just go to work and not the state pen 
 Cause you live better when you're out there free 
 And that's comin' straight to ya from the Young MC 
 (Digital Underground) 
 I'm in a rage 
 Oh yeah? Yo, why is that g? 
 Other races, they say we act like rats in a cage 
 I tried to argue, but check it, every night in the news 
 We prove them suckers right and I got the blues 
 America... 
 Get busy, Humpy 
 The red, the white, the blue and 
 The blue and the red 
 For Clips and Bloods 
 The white for who's got you doin' 
 Time bustin' caps on one another 
 The Underground's down for peace among brothers 
 Kill a black man? 
 What? 
 Yo, what are you retarded? 
 Tell em, Hump 
 Yo, do you work for the Klan? 
 Do what you like 
 Unless you like gangbangin 
 Let's see how many brothers leave us hangin' 
 (Oaktown's 3.4.7.) 
 The gang that should hang is the one that contains 
 The sisters and the brothers who are all in the same frame of mind 
 Now listen, get loose, it's unity time 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Peace is a presence that we all need 
 The future's in our hands, in word and deed 
 I'm Terrible T and I'm Sweet LD 
 We're 3.5.7. totally 
 (MC Hammer) 
 Kickin on the ave 'bout a quarter to 9 
 All the homies gettin' blind in an eight ball line 
 Now on this tip they started runnin' at the lip 
 Jumped in their deuce and took a little trip 
 Hit the block about 12 on the tick 
 The windows went down and the nines went click 
 People started yellin', bodies started bailin 
 Bullets cold flyin sendin some to hell and 
 It's gotta stop, we don't need all the violence 
 Peace in the hood and a moment of silence 
 We got together not for ego or fame 
 We got involved 'cause we're all in the same gang 
 (Eazy-E) 
 Last but not least, yo, Eazy's no sell-out 
 And if you can't hang in the streets, then get the hell out 
 I'm not tryin' to tell ya what to do 
 You have your own freedom of choice who to listen to 
 You knew good from bad, fair from foul, right from wrong 
 Now your mother's singing that sad song 
 (My baby ain't never hurt nobody!) 
 But he still got smoked at Bébé's party 
 But you're not the first or the last 
 You're nothin' but a short story from the past 
 You're dead now, not number one but a zero 
 Take notes from Eazy-E, the violent hero 
 (Michel'le) 
 Don't you know we've got to put our heads together? 
 Don't you know we've got to put our heads together?"
100,Dr. Dre,hiphop,What You Say,"(Dr. Dre) 
 Huh, so I'm out the game huh? 
 (Eminem) 
 Yo Dre, we ridin'? 
 (Dr. Dre) 
 Whatever 
 (Eminem) 
 Well I'm witchu homie 
 (Dr. Dre) 
 Ok, Let's handle this muhfucker 
 (Eminem) 
 I was born to brew up storms 'n' stir up shit 
 Kick up dust, cuss till I slur up spit 
 Grew up too quickly been through too much shit 
 Corrupt and now they pour it on like syrup, bitch 
 Thick in gritz, sick and twisted Mr. Buttersworth 
 Dre tole me to milk this shit for what it's worth 
 Till the cow just tilts and tips 'n' stumbles to earth 
 And if I fumble the verse, keep going 
 First take, I make mistakes, just keep it 
 No punches, pull no punches, that's weak shit 
 Fake shit if I ever take shit, I eat shit 
 Was it for him? Wouldn't be shit 
 (Dr. Dre) 
 Creep wit me, as we take a little trip down Memory Lane 
 Been in longer than anyone in the game 
 And I ain't got to lie about my age 
 (Eminem) 
 But what about Jermaine? 
 (Dr. Dre) 
 Fuck Jermaine, he don't belong speakin' mine or Timbaland's name 
 And don't think 
 I don't read your little interviews and see what your sayin' 
 I'ma giant, and I ain't gotta move till I'm revoked 
 When I see you, I'ma step on you and not even know it 
 Ya midget, Mini-Me, with a buncha little Mini-You's 
 Runnin' around your backyard swimming pools 
 Over 80 million records sold 
 And I ain't had to do it with 10 or 11 year olds 
 (Eminem) 
 'Cause what you say is what you say 
 Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it 
 Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin it 
 So who you playin' with huh huh huh huh? 
 'Cause what you say is what you say 
 Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it 
 Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin it 
 So who you playin' with huh huh huh huh? 
 (Eminem) 
 Second verse, it gets worst 
 It gets no better than this 
 Amatuers drink veteran piss 
 From a Dixie cup, if you ever mix me up 
 Or confuse me with a Canibus or Dre with a Dupri 
 Will rub it in, every club you're in, we'll have you 
 Blackballed and make sure you never rap a fucken again 
 Dre ain't havin' it as long as I'm here, play Devil's Advocate 
 (Dr. Dre) 
 If there was some magic shit I could wave 
 Over the indusrty that could save it when I'm gone 
 And bury to make sure the tradition carries on 
 I would 
 (Eminem) 
 If I could only use this power for good 
 I wouldn't, not even if I could 
 (Dr. Dre) 
 From the hood and I'm a hornet 
 And I'ma only sting when I'm cornered 
 (Eminem) 
 And I'ma only sucker punch or swing without warnin 
 And swing to knock somebody's fuckin' head off 
 'Cause I know, when they get up, I won't get a chance to let off 
 Another punch, I'm punk-rock, no one's punk 
 Don't give a fuck, white pop, so much spunk 
 When I was little I knew I would blow up 
 And sell a mil or grow up to be a tiller 
 Go nuts and be a killer 
 (Dr. Dre) 
 And I'm somethin' of a phenom 
 One puff of the chron 
 I'm unstoppable, I'm alive, I'm on top again 
 There's no obstacle that I can't conquer 
 So come along with us (Come On) 
 (Eminem) 
 'Cause what you say is what you say 
 Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it 
 Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin it 
 So who you playin' with huh huh huh huh?

 (Dr. Dre) 
 Now anybody who knows Dre 
 Knows I'm about fast cars and alazey, partyin all day 
 But I handle my business 'cause it's work before play 
 Don't look for trouble but I serve you gourmet 
 However you want it, you could have it your way 
 You fuck my night up, I'ma fuck up your day 
 Bullet with your name, sendin it your way 
 That goes for anyone who walks through that doorway 
 'Cause this is my space, you invade it 
 Live to regret it and you die tryin' to violate it 
 Fuck around and you'll get anahilated 
 Eyes diliated 
 (Eminem) 
 Ha, like my old lady 
 'Cause what you say is what you say 
 Sometimes what you mean is 2 different things 
 Depending on your mood, if it swings, think too many things 
 Little hit of Dre's weed, I can do anything 
 Catch a contact, then I'm gone and I'm back 
 I speed write and my loose leaves my lanch pad 
 (Dr. Dre) 
 And I can pull any string 
 Don't have to prove anything 
 Catch a contract on your head 
 You headed West, talk shit about Dre? 
 You better get a vest, then invest in something 
 To protect your head and neck 
 (Eminem) 
 And it's back and forth all day like Red and Meth 
 I joke when I say I'm the best in the booth 
 But a lot of truth is said injest 
 And if I ever do live to be a legend 
 I'ma die a sudden death, 5 mics in The Source 
 Ain't holdin' my fuckin' breath 
 But I suffocate for the respect 
 Fore I breath the collect the fuckin' check 
 (Eminem) 
 'Cause what you say is what you say 
 Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it 
 Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin it 
 So who you playin' with huh huh huh huh?

102,Dr. Dre,hiphop,World Class,"We call him Yella, he is the best 
 He rocks the house on the DMX 
 When he's on the beatbox, he cannot miss 
 So listen to the beat, as he rocks like this... 
 Yes, Yella is his name, and he's created 
 The big beat sound, so devastated 
 Party people in the place, you beware of the shock 
 'Cause Yella (Yella) Yella is on the beatbox, huh! 
 To feel the beat, it's time for you 
 To rock with the devastatin' Wreckin Cru 
 You got snare, hi-hat and bass in your face 
 So come on Yella boy, let's wreck this place, huh! 
 The headlines read ""We are in Town"" 
 The World Class Cru is gonna throw down 
 We are here, and here to stay 
 And we came to raise hell, and not to play 
 As we grow stronger, you get weaker 
 Sucker MC put your ear to the speaker 
 There is no doubt that we are best 
 We don't have to scratch just to make the beat fresh 
 The beat will blast and we'll outlast 
 There is no other that's in its class 
 It's not a 808 or a Drum-you-lator 
 It's a DMX and it is greater 
 It makes a sound that's so unique 
 Huh! To rock your butt and move your feet 
 Now sucker MC's we will impress 
 'Cause Yella (Yella) Yella on the DMX, huh-huh! 
 Party people in the place, we're not through 
 We're gonna show just what we're gonna do 
 So listen up close and don't miss a word 
 'Cause it is the hardest rap you ever heard 
 Like a blast from heaven, a blaze from hell 
 Who's comin' on the mic? Well, it's Cli-n-tel 
 So sucker MC's, you better beware 
 'Cause I will be your next nightmare 
 Yes, I am fresh, the MC wizard 
 When it comes to cold raps, huh, I'm a blizzard 
 Well, I'm the genius, the mastermind 
 Super def creator of MC rhymes 
 So come a little closer and you will see 
 Who? The Cli-n-tel's in the place to be 
 Now comin' on the mic without delay 
 A little ""Bom bom bom""... It's Dr Dre 
 I'm the physician who's gonna start dishin' 
 All them things that you've been missin' 
 If it's for answers that you have been fishin' 
 Take a bite of this for your nutrition 
 I'm the real doctor, that is final 
 All you other suckers are made of vinyl 
 I won the election to issue injections 
 To who? Sucker MC's who wish for perfection 
 Next in line there's Lonzo 
 Producer of the groove, grandmaster of the show 
 The head debater, there is none greater 
 Because he is the Cru's creator 
 You put us all together, you've got the best 
 While Yella throws down on a DMX, huh-huh!"

 That's just the way I be pimpin' 
 You might not believe me 
 That's just the way I be pimpin'

 I'm livin' a motion picture 
 Me and my niggas, and 16 bars 
 Will make the big screen ours 
 What is this? Everybody's jiggy now 
 Is the hustle that good in 
 Everybody's city now? Or do they act good? 
 I pimp on the street, I pimp in my sleep 
 And when I snore it sounds like 
 I'm sayin' ""Where's my money?"" 
 I ain't playin', I'm out there 
 Like, ""Where's my honies?"" 
 You gotta be a pimp to understand 
 Just how I'm layin 
 Fuck a Lex bubble, I'm rich 
 And after this 
 I'ma be rich all over again, except double 
 See, you ain't so hard if you ain't burnin rubber 
 In somethin' with numbers after the dot, you ain't no star 
 Me and my whole crew, did either shot a nigga 
 Or been shot, and if you chuck us out, ain't no scars 
 Hint: steppin to me is suicide 
 And that basically means that you can die

 Me and my niggas was tradin hoes 
 Like ""What they fadin fo'?"" 
 Carry my books you hoe 
 I had 'em slavin, yo 
 I get scarred then I played the hoe 
 Like ""Way to go"" 
 Controllin the halls 
 Holdin' a black Mack-11 
 Under the black leather 
 Platforms, a hat with a feather 
 I was so naughty, drivin' a gold Audi 
 All we did was throw parties 
 And show up with Gold Gotti 
 Handsome, endsome, I'm the one you ran from 
 'Cause you could only be the man in the shit 
 That I was banned from 
 Make this shit seem easy 
 Fiends need me 
 Make the most conceited chick 
 In this bitch seem sleazy 
 Pleased at what I'm doin' 
 And to all y'all pimp niggas 
 Pimp on, and I'll see y'all at the reunion"
104,Dr. Dre,hiphop,You,"Wait 
 It's you 
 And at the end of it all it's you 
 And at the end 
 It's you 
 At the end of it all it's you 
 It's you 
 It's you 
 At the end of it all it's you 
 It's you 
 It's you 
 At the end of it all 
 Lookin' for how I see her 
 When I finally realized couldn't believe it 
 I couldn't, even swallow 
 Had a lump in my throat my stomach hollow 
 I had a notion that things were fishy 
 But everything was fine so I'd be pissy 
 But when you wasn't seeing me nights you get in 
 That's when the snoopin' and shit it would begin 
 Where you at? 
 Where you going? 
 That's what I get when I pick up the phone 
 Not a hello or I miss you 
 Or the renaissance how does it do? 
 Suspicious ones go few 
 Can stress out your brain 
 In weighs on your mane 
 And helps you peep game I thought it was me 
 But then I could it see 
 It was you 
 It's you 
 At the end of it all it was you 
 And at the end 
 It was you 
 At the end of it all it was you 
 And at the end 
 It's you 
 It's you 
 At the end of it all it's you 
 It's you 
 It's you 
 At the end of it all 
 I couldn't take it 
 But the spell of love 
 I couldn't shake it 
 Even though I would discover 
 That there was somebody else 
 It was your lover 
 You gave me up 
 And managed to turn the tables 
 And all your honest words they turn to fables 
 The things that you would accuse me of 
 It seem were the things you were doin' love 
 Get it? these things you projected 
 And I don't want to be affected 
 But when you get in love 
 It's never easy love 
 To make decisions of 
 You've defected 
 You were doin' so much to try to pin me 
 Goin' through all my stuff but it was empty 
 Answers, that I'm seekin' 
 Well it seem I'm gettin' close 
 That I'm reachin' 
 And I was thinkin' I had no reason 
 Callin' you a culprit it was treason 
 And the twinkle in your eye 
 It was kinda not for love 
 And tell me why? 
 We'll make a mends if you admit it 
 We can ascend if your committed 
 Your heart, is it in it? 
 If it goes for many days 
 Sweet love can decay from you 
 It's you 
 At the end of it all it was you 
 And at the end 
 It was you 
 At the end of it all it was you 
 And the end 
 It's you 
 It's you 
 At the end of it all it's you 
 It's you 
 It's you 
 At the end of it all"
