 The human mile, they're never coming back 
 Hold out your hand and ask for some 
 Now and again she sits beneath the tree 
 The sign above reads 
 Hard Work will Set you Free 
 Hold out your hand and ask for some 
 Too late for another direction 
 Always what we've got in store 
 Hurry back we've all been waiting 
 We can't take much anymore 
 Where are the days where brothers are brothers 
 A childless mother 
 Leave it except for one"

 I hear her scream from down the hall 
 Amazing she can even talk at all 
 She cries to me, 
 ""Go back to bed."" 
 I'm terrified that she'll wind up dead in his hands 
 She's just a woman... Never again 
 Been there before but not like this 
 Seen it before but not like this 
 Never before have I ever seen it this bad 
 She's just a woman... Never again 
 Just tell the nurse you slipped and fell 
 It starts to sting as it starts to swell 
 She looks at you, she wants the truth 
 It's right out there in the waiting room with those hands 
 Lookin' just as sweet as he can... Never again 
 Seen it before but not like this 
 Been there before but not like this 
 Never before have I ever seen it this bad 
 She's just a woman... Never again 
 Never again 
 Father's a name you haven't earned yet 
 You're just a child with a temper 
 Haven't you heard ""don't hit a lady""? 
 Kickin' your ass would be a pleasure, oh oh 
 He's drunk again, it's time to fight 
 Same old shit, just on a different night 
 She grabs the gun, she's had enough 
 Tonight she'll find out how fuckin' tough is this man 
 Pulls the trigger fast as she can... Never again 
 Seen it before but not like this 
 Been there before but not like this 
 Never before have I ever seen it this bad 
 She's just a woman... Never again 
 Seen it before but not like this

 Out in the back in the old corn field 
 Underneath the tractor wheel 
 Thought I'd dig till I found it first 
 Broke my back and died of thirst 
 Well you can bribe the devil, you can pray to God 
 You can sell off everything you've got

 Scared to face, the dyin' nothin' 
 See the cycle I've waited for 
 It ain't like that anymore 
 Where I go is when I feel I'm able 
 How I fight is why I'm feelin' sore 
 In my Mind, not forgotten 
 Feel as though, a tooth were rotten 
 Behind the smile, a tongue that's slippin' 
 Buzzards cry, when flesh is rippin' 
 See the cycle I've waited for 
 It ain't like that anymore 
 Here I sit writing on the paper 
 Trying to think of words you can't ignore 
 In my eyes, what I'm lacking 
 Score at face, a ten for slacking 
 Sign the deal, set in motion 
 Smaller fish, so huge the ocean 
 See the cycle I've waited for

 From what you do, because of you 
 You know I can't be there 
 Each time that you call 
 I swore not to come 
 But I'm here after all 
 I know by the look that I see in your eye 
 I won't stand around and I won't watch you die 
 From what you do 
 (What you do, what you do, what's because of you 
 What you do, what you do, what's because of) 
 From what you do 
 Hands on the mirror 
 Can't get much clearer 
 Can't make this all go away 
 Now that you're bleeding 
 You stare at the ceiling 
 And watch as it all fades away 
 From what you do, because of you 
 You know I can't be there 
 Each time that you call 
 I swore not to come 
 But I'm here after all 
 I know by the look that I see in your eye 
 I won't stand around and I won't watch you die

 Blew every dollar that we ever made 
 The cops hated us hangin' out 
 They say somebody went and burned it down

 Maybe a little too well 
 Finger on the trigger, loaded bullet 
 He hit the stage so full of rage 
 And let the whole world know it 
 Six feet away, they heard him say 
 ""Oh God, don't let him pull it"" 
 Please God, don't let him pull it 
 How could you put us through it? 
 His brother watched you do it 
 How could you take his life away? 
 (What made you think you had the right...) 
 How could you be so full of hate? 
 (...To take away somebody's life?) 
 And when I heard you let him die 
 And made the world all wonder why 
 I sat at home and on my own, 
 I cried alone 
 And scratched your name 
 On the side of a bullet 
 And in the wake of his mistake 
 So many lives are broken 
 Gone forever from a loaded bullet 
 And no excuse that you could use 
 Could pull somebody through it 
 And to this day so many say 
 ""God why'd you let him do it?"" 
 How could you let him do it? 
 How could you put us through it? 
 His brother watched him do it 
 How could you take his life away?

 And I borrow things that I don't need

 There's gotta be somebody for me out there

 And, damn it, this feels too right 
 It's just like déjà vu; me, standing here with you

 She had her eyes on the prize as the girl next door 
 You grow up quick when you grow up poor 
 It's the only way to LA that she knows 
 The Hollywood pose: teeth, tits, and toes 
 It didn't take her long to leave the boulevard 
 So many five star friends with black credit cards 
 She'd try anything once 
 'Cause anything goes 
 It never comes easy when you're digging for gold 
 (Hey, hey) 
 Well she ain't no Cinderella 
 When she's getting undressed 
 'Cause she rocks it like the naughty Wicked Witch of the West 
 Far too pretty to be giving it cheap 
 That's why she's making six figures working three days a week 
 Yeah she'd even break a promise in the promised land 
 She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands 
 She'd shake her money maker twice as hot as anyone can 
 She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands 
 (Hey, hey) 
 I doubt she'd even let the Devil buy her little black book 
 City Hall would probably fall off if anyone got a look 
 Every A-list player is a favorite friend 
 Since they all taste the fame in the back of the Benz 
 A congressman would call her every once in a while 
 Got the school girl skirt on the top of the pile 
 She's done everyone once 
 And everyone knows 
 You got to get a little dirty when you're digging for gold

 She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands 
 Well someone spilled the beans and now her name's in the press 
 Tough to keep it all a secret when you're one of the best 
 The judge is going easy 'cause he paid for her chest 
 Yeah he loves his little naughty wicked witch of the west 
 Far too pretty to be giving it cheap 
 That's why she's making six figures working three days a week

72,Nickelback,rock,If Today Was Your Last Day,"My best friend gave me the best advice 
 He said each day's a gift and not a given right 
 Leave no stone unturned, Leave your fears behind 
 And try to take the path less traveled by 
 That first step you take is the longest stride 
 If today was your last day 
 And tomorrow was too late 
 Could you say goodbye to yesterday? 
 Would you live each moment like your last? 
 Leave old pictures in the past 
 Donate every dime you have? 
 If today was your last day, 
 If today was your last day. 
 Against the grain should be a way of life 
 What's worth the price is always worth the fight 
 Every second counts 'cause there's no second try, 
 So live like you'll never live it twice 
 Don't take the free ride in your own life 
 If today was your last day 
 And tomorrow was too late 
 Could you say goodbye to yesterday? 
 Would you live each moment like your last? 
 Leave old pictures in the past 
 Donate every dime you have? 
 Would you call old friends you never see? 
 Reminisce old memories 
 Would you forgive your enemies? 
 Would you find that one you're dreamin' of 
 Swear up and down to God above 
 That you finally fall in love 
 If today was your last day 
 If today was your last day... 
 Would you make your mark 
 By mending a broken heart? 
 You know it's never too late 
 To shoot for the stars, 
 Regardless of who you are 
 So do whatever it takes 
 'cause you can't rewind 
 A moment in this life 
 Let nothin' stand in your way 
 'cause the hands of time 
 Are never on your side 
 If today was your last day 
 And tomorrow was too late, 
 Could you say goodbye to yesterday? 
 Would you live each moment like your last? 
 Leave old pictures in the past 
 Donate every dime you have? 
 Would you call old friends you never see? 
 Reminisce old memories 
 Would you forgive your enemies? 
 Would you find that one you're dreamin' of 
 Swear up and down to God above 
 That you finally fall in love 
 If today was your last day"
73,Nickelback,rock,This Afternoon,"Looking like another 
 Bob Marley 
 day 
 Hitting from the bong like a diesel train 
 And I'm down with hanging out 
 This afternoon 
 We got weeds in the backyard four feet tall 
 Cheech & Chong 
 probably would'a smoked them all 
 So I'm out on the couch 
 This afternoon 
 Beer bottles layin' on the kitchen floor 
 If we take 'em all back we can buy some more 
 So I doubt we'll go without 
 This afternoon 
 You better hang on 
 If you're tagging along 
 'Cause we'll be doing this 
 'Til six in the morning 
 Nothing wrong with going all night long 
 Tough to put the brakes on 
 Doesn't matter when you gotta 
 Get up, and go out 
 Me and all my friends 
 We drink up, we fall down 
 And then we do it all again 
 Just sitting around 
 Hanging out this afternoon 
 Landlord says I should buy a tent 
 But he can kiss my ass 'cause I paid the rent 
 So I doubt he'll kick me out 
 This afternoon 
 Down on the corner in a seedy bar 
 Jukebox cranking out the 
 CCR 
 Had a few to 
 Susie Q 
 This afternoon 
 You better hang on 
 If you're tagging along 
 'Cause we'll be doing this 
 'Til six in the morning 
 Nothing wrong with going all night long 
 Tough to put the brakes on 
 Doesn't matter when you gotta 
 Get up, and go out 
 Me and all my friends 
 We drink up, we fall down 
 And then we do it all again 
 Yeah we get up, and go out 
 Me and all my friends 
 We drink up, we fall down 
 And then we do it all again 
 Just sitting around 
 Hanging out this afternoon 
 Don't wanna wrist watch 
 Or an alarm clock 
 To see what time it is 
 From the moment I wake up 
 I just love being with my friends 
 We barely get by 
 But have the best times 
 And hope it never ends 
 We drink all day 
 Until we fall down 
 So we can do it all again 
 It's not the human walk 
 It's the human race 
 If you ain't livin' on the edge 
 You're takin' too much space 
 So I doubt I'll figure out 
 Just what to do 
 'Bout to kick it around 
 Hangin' out this afternoon 
 You better hang on 
 If you're tagging along 
 'Cause we'll be doing this 
 'Til six in the morning 
 Nothing wrong with going all night long 
 Tough to put the brakes on 
 Doesn't matter when you gotta 
 Get up, and go out

 We drink up, we fall down 
 And then we do it all again 
 Yeah we get up, and go out 
 Me and all my friends 
 We drink up, we fall down 
 And then we do it all again 
 Just kicking around 
 Hanging out this afternoon 
 Sitting around 
 Hanging out this afternoon (Last call, you sons of bitches!) 
 Just kicking around 
 Hanging out this afternoon 
 Yeah, just sitting around 
 Hanging out this afternoon (Drinks on the house!) 
 Just kicking around 
 Hanging out this afternoon 
 Just sitting around

 Oh, she grabbed a bottle of tequila and a lime for her lips 
 Laid her body on the bar and put the salt on her hips

 Hotter than a barrel on a squeezed machine gun, oh 
 Well, she can get it lower then a Maserati 
 Never seen somebody move that way 
 Everywhere she goes there's an instant party 
 Everybody wants to know her name

 Get her hands on anything to stand on, anything to dance on

 What I'm waiting for 
 Will wash this pain away 
 And it's never too late 
 Never too late 
 And if forever never comes then I 
 And if forever never comes then I 
 And if forever never comes then I 
 I'll hold on, and hold on... 
 (And hold on... and hold on...) 
 Now you know why... 
 I'm lost without you 
 And there's nothing I can do 
 You're the one I can't go without 
 If I ain't holding on to you then I'll be holding out forever 
 I've got you now and 
 I'm not letting go of you 
 Never be together long enough 
 'Cause every moment I'm with you it's like I'm holding on to heaven 
 And if forever never comes then I 
 And if forever never comes then I 
 And if forever never comes then I 
 'Cause every moment I'm with you it's like I'm holding on to heaven

 I've got two tickets to the game 
 It'd be great if I could take you to it this Sunday 
 And I'll walk you home when the whole thing's done 
 If you're there I don't even care which team won 
 We could stop at the coffee shop 
 And make fun of the cops in the parking lot 
 And we could laugh as we both pretend 
 That we're not in love and that we're just good friends 
 Well I'm tired of pretending 
 But I'm terrified of it ending 
 I know when I'm with you 
 There's nothing I could do

 Saturday I'm gonna take her out 
 'Cause her favorite band is going to play downtown 
 Gonna sing the song we've all heard of 
 About those two young friends that should've fell in love 
 Later on we'll cut through the park 
 And she can hold my hand because she hates the dark 
 And we can laugh as we both pretend 
 That we're not in love and that we're just good friends

 About Sunday night just her and I 
 Sittin' side by side in the full moon light 
 I pulled her close just to hold her tight 
 And the both of us could tell it just felt right 
 She looked at me in the sweetest way 
 Like she could tell what the hell I was about to say 
 Must have took a while just to find the words 
 'Cause she cut me off and finally said it first 
 Well I'm tired of pretending 
 But I'm terrified of it ending 
 I know when I'm with you 
 There's nothing I could do

 Take one of those and two of these 
 Then watch the walls begin to breathe 
 I can taste the color of the lights 
 Wings are growing out of me 
 The floor is floating underneath 
 I can see the future burning bright 
 Yeah, future's burning bright! 
 The ceiling has us mesmerized 
 It feels like we could never die 
 Heading for the dark side of the moon 
 As we lift up into the sky 
 Invincible and so alive 
 Ten feet tall and fucking bulletproof 
 Insanity is setting in, reality is getting thin 
 The universe just started slowing down 
 And suddenly we're travelling 
 A million miles an hour 
 A million miles an hour 
 We're going a million miles an hour 
 A million miles an hour 
 When shadows soon start breaking free 
 No longer held by gravity 
 (How did we get so far from the ground?) 
 Speaking to the galaxy 
 Received and sending back to me 
 I can finally hear the speed of sound 
 The speed of fucking sound! 
 I like this everlasting pill 
 'Cause time itself is standing still 
 Why's the room still spinning just the same? 
 Turn off your phone so no one calls 
 'Cause you and I are tripping balls 
 I can still hear ringing in my brain 
 Insanity is setting in, reality is getting thin 
 See no signs of ever coming down 
 And suddenly we're travelling 
 A million miles an hour 
 A million miles an hour 
 We're going a million miles an hour 
 A million miles an hour 
 Insanity is setting in, reality is getting thin 
 Particles are dancing all around 
 I can't deny the hardest thing for me 
 Is finding time to finally breathe 
 Ain't no signs of ever coming down 
 Another wave is coming in... 
 A million miles an hour 
 A million miles an hour 
 We're going a million miles an hour 
 A million miles an hour 
 A million miles an hour 
 A million miles an hour 
 A million miles an hour 
 A million miles an hour."

 Packed all of my shit and moved across the country 
 And now we buying diamonds sayin'

 On that blonde girl 
 Keep up with what you're doing, ain't nothing wrong girl 
 Looks like we got another, come along girl

 And I can see this song will be about you 
 I can't believe that I can breathe without you 
 But all I need to do is carry on 
 The next line I write down 
 And there's a tear that falls between the pages 
 I know that pain's supposed to heal in stages 
 But it depends which one it's standing on 
 I write lines down then rip them up 
 Describing love can't be this tough 
 I could set this song on fire, send it up in smoke 
 I could throw it in the river and watch it sink in slowly 
 Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon 
 Play it for the world but it won't mean much 
 Unless I sing this song to you 
 I'm dying to show you 
 This could end happily ever after 
 There doesn't ever have to be disaster 
 And all you have to do is sing along 
 I write lines down then rip them up 
 Impossible describing love 
 I could set this song on fire, send it up in smoke 
 I could throw it in the river and watch it sink in slowly 
 Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon 
 Play it for the world but it won't mean much 
 Unless I sing this song to you 
 I could set this song on fire 
 Sing this song to you 
 I could set this song on fire 
 Light this old guitar on fire, I'd still hear the notes 
 Drown the melody in water, I'd still hear its ghost 
 Sing it with somebody else but we'd be out of tune 
 Play it for the world but it won't mean much 
 I could set this song on fire, send it up in smoke 
 I could throw it in the river and watch it sink in slowly 
 Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon 
 Play it for the world but it won't mean much 
 Unless I sing this song to you 
 I could set this song on fire

 Spend your days happy and grateful 
 Avoid the taste of wanting and wasteful 
 Every good thing will come in moderation 
 Envy and greed will only lead to frustration 
 Choose your friends carefree and kindly 
 Choose your words careful and wisely 
 Always be there to lend a comforting shoulder 
 One will be there to share a day when you're older

 Every regret is a debt that you live with 
 Never forget to remember forgiveness

 And we drank more tequila than any man alive

 And not really on what you've spent 
 When it's obvious that you bore me 
 I'm not worried, 'cause it's five minutes to your glory 
 Well, I'm drowning in your ocean 
 It's much cooler in slow motion 
 Leave it up to me and I will 
 Be the one here to see that you stand still 
 Everyone sees your eyes getting wider 
 Everyone here believes you're a liar 
 Well, that straw just broke 
 I'm a line in your tasteless joke 
 Right after you've a punched a hole in 
 Don't worry, 'cause it's not broken, it's just swollen 
 Could anticipate 
 How you're feeling from day to day 
 Since it's obvious that you bore me 
 I'm not worried, 'cause it's five minutes to your glory 
 Leave it up to me and I will 
 Be the one here to see that you stand still 
 Everyone sees your eyes getting wider 
 Everyone here believes you're a liar, you're a liar"

 So perfect, so worthless 
 If I could take it all back think again, I would

 I'll know it by the feeling 
 The moment when we're meeting 
 Will play out like a scene straight off the silver screen 
 So I'll be holdin' my breath 
 Right up 'til the end 
 Until that moment when 
 I find the one that I'll spend forever with! 
 'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there 
 'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares 
 Someone to love with my life in their hands 
 There's gotta be somebody for me like that 
 'Cause nobody wants to go it on their own 
 And everyone wants to know they're not alone 
 There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere 
 There's gotta be somebody for me out there 
 Tonight 
 Out on the street, out in the moonlight 
 And, this feels too right 
 It's just like déjà vu 
 Me standin' here with you 
 So I'll be holdin' my breath 
 Could this be the end? 
 Is it that moment when 
 I find the one that I'll spend forever with?

 Someone to love with my life in their hands 
 There's gotta be somebody for me like that

 There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere 
 There's gotta be somebody for me out there

 When you're lookin' for a diamond in the rough 
 Because you'll never know when it shows up 
 Make sure you're holdin' on

 'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there 
 And everyone wants to feel like someone cares 
 Someone to love with my life in their hands

 Twisted so tightly, and sorted so carefully

 I'm Alone in a room with these taunted sheets 
 I can see what you see 
 And it wanted to me 
 The same old conversaton

 You swore, I would regret it 
 Now thanks to you I can't forget it

 Won't even miss you at all 
 Free from the slap that you go

 You gave to me

 Of ups and downs

 Can turn around 
 In an instant 
 It feels so good to reunite 
 Within yourself and 
 Within your mind
