 The lines that crack your face 
 Famine, your body, it has torn through 
 Withered in every place 
 Pestilence, for what you had to endure 
 And what you have put others through 
 Death, deliverance, for you, for sure 
 Now there's nothing you can do 
 So, gather 'round, young warriors, now 
 And saddle up your steeds 
 Killing scores with demon swords 
 Now is the death of doers of wrong 
 Swing the judgement hammer down 
 Safely inside armor, blood, guts, and sweat 
 The Horsemen are drawing nearer 
 On leather steeds they ride 
 They've come to take your life 
 On through the dead of night 
 With the Four Horsemen ride

 Flash before my eyes 
 Now it's time to die

 I can feel the flame 
 Wait for the sign to flick the switch of death

 Constant chill deep inside 
 Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey 
 On they fight, for the right, yes, but who's to say? 
 For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know 
 Stiffened wounds test their pride 
 Men of five, still alive through the raging glow 
 Gone insane from the pain that they surely know 
 For whom the bell tolls 
 Time marches on 
 For whom the bell tolls 
 Take a look to the sky just before you die 
 It's the last time he will 
 Blackened roar, massive roar, fills the crumbling sky 
 Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry 
 Stranger now are his eyes to this mystery 
 He hears the silence so loud 
 Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be 
 Now they see, what will be, blinded eyes to see 
 For whom the bell tolls 
 Time marches on 
 For whom the bell tolls"

 Drifting further every day 
 Getting lost within myself 
 Nothing matters, no one else 
 I have lost the will to live 
 Simply nothing more to give 
 There is nothing more for me 
 Need the end to set me free 
 Things not what they used to be 
 Missing one inside of me 
 Deathly loss, this can't be real 
 Cannot stand this hell I feel 
 Emptiness is filling me 
 To the point of agony 
 Growing darkness taking dawn 
 I was me but now he's gone 
 No one but me can save myself but it's too late 
 Now I can't think, think why I should even try 
 Yesterday seems as though it never existed 
 Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye

 Can't get caught in the endless circle 
 Ring of stupidity 
 Out for my own, out to be free 
 One with my mind, they just can't see

 Rape my mind and destroy my feelings 
 Don't tell me what to do 
 I don't care now 'cause I'm on my side 
 And I can see through you 
 Feed my brain with your so called standards 
 Who says that I ain't right 
 Break away from your common fashion 
 See through your blurry sight 
 Out for my own, out to be free 
 One with my mind, they just can't see 
 No need to hear things that they say

 Soldier boy, made of clay, now an empty shell 
 Twenty-one, only son but he served us well 
 Bred to kill, not to care, do just as we say 
 Finished here, greetings Death, he's yours to take away 
 Back to the front, you will do what I say, when I say 
 Back to the front, you will die when I say, you must die 
 Back to the front, you coward, you servant, you blind man 
 Why am I dying? 
 Kill, have no fear 
 Lie, live off lying 
 Hell, hell is here 
 Why am I dying? 
 Kill, have no fear 
 Lie, live off lying 
 Hell, hell is here 
 I was born for dying 
 Life planned out before my birth, nothing could I say 
 Had no chance to see myself, moulded day by day 
 Looking back I realize, nothing have I done 
 Left to die with only friend, alone I clench my gun 
 Soldier boy, made of clay, now an empty shell 
 Twenty-one, only son but he served us well 
 Bred to kill, not to care, do just as we say 
 Finished here, greetings Death, he's yours to take away 
 Back to the front, you will do what I say, when I say 
 Back to the front, you will die when I say, you must die

 Tied to machines that make me be

 Unspoiled, unspoken

 Opposition - Contradiction 
 Premonition - Compromise 
 Agitation - Violation 
 Masturbation... On our face 
 Darkest color: Blistered Earth... True death of life 
 (Frayed Ends of Sanity: Verse 1) 
 Never hunger - Never prosper 
 I have fallen prey to failure... 
 Struggle within triggered again 
 Now the candle burns at both ends... 
 (And Justice For All: Verse 1) 
 Halls of Justice painted green, money talking 
 Power wolves beset your door, hear them stalking 
 Soon you'll please their appetite, they devour 
 Hammer of Justice crushes you, overpower 
 (AJFA: Pre-Chorus) 
 The ultimate in vanity 
 Exploiting their supremacy 
 I can't believe the things you say 
 I can't believe, I can't believe the price you pay 
 Nothing can save you 
 (AJFA: Chorus) 
 Justice is lost - Justice is raped - Justice is gone 
 Pulling your strings... Justice is done 
 Seeking no truth - Winning is all 
 Find it so grim, so true, so real 
 (AJFA: Verse 2) 
 Apathy, their stepping stone, so unfeeling 
 Hidden, deep animosity, so deceiving 
 Through your eyes, their light burns, hoping to find 
 Inquisition sinking you with prying minds 
 (AJFA: Pre-Chorus) 
 The ultimate in vanity 
 Exploiting their supremacy 
 I can't believe the things you say 
 I can't believe, I can't believe the price you pay 
 Nothing can save you

 Justice is lost - Justice is raped - Justice is gone 
 Pulling your strings... Justice is done 
 Seeking no truth - Winning is all 
 Find it so grim, so true, so real

 Blackened is the end - Winter it will send 
 Throwing all you see into obscurity 
 Death of Mother Earth - Never a rebirth 
 Evolution's end - Never will it mend... Never 
 (Blackened: Chorus) 
 Fire, to begin whipping dance of the dead 
 Blackened is the end 
 To begin whipping dance of the dead 
 Color our world blackened 
 (Blackened: Chorus (alt)) 
 Fire is the outcome of hypocrisy 
 Darkest potency 
 In the exit of Humanity 
 Color our world blackened! Blackened!"

 Other times you can 
 Oh, the same old clichés

 Every ounce of energy 
 You try to give away 
 As the sweat pours out your body 
 Like the music that you play, yeah 
 Later in the evening 
 As you lie awake in bed 
 With the echoes of the amplifiers 
 Ringing in your head 
 You smoke the day's last cigarette 
 Remembering what she said 
 What she said

 Back into the past 
 You are the fish for which I cast 
 And what of the future? 
 What is to be? 
 As the rivers flow into the sea 
 And I try to get through to you 
 In my own special way 
 As the barriers crumble 
 At the end of the day 
 Do not take for granted 
 Powers out there 
 Don't step into the demon's lair

123,Metallica,metal,The Unforgiven III,"How could he know this new dawn's light 
 Would change his life forever?

 With his careless dreaming? 
 Been afraid, always afraid 
 Of the things he's feeling 
 He could just be gone 
 He would just sail on 
 He'll just sail on 
 How can I be lost 
 If I've got nowhere to go? 
 Search for seas of gold 
 How come it's got so cold? 
 How can I be lost 
 In remembrance I relive? 
 And how can I blame you 
 When it's me I can't forgive? 
 These days drift on inside a fog 
 It's thick and suffocating 
 This sinking life, outside it's hell 
 Inside intoxicating 
 He's run aground like his life 
 Water much too shallow 
 Slipping fast, down with his ship 
 Fading in the shadows 
 Now a castaway 
 They've all gone away 
 They've gone away 
 How can I be lost 
 If I've got nowhere to go? 
 Searched for seas of gold 
 How come it's got so cold?

 In remembrance I relive? 
 And how can I blame you 
 When it's me I can't forgive? 
 Forgive me 
 Forgive me not 
 Forgive me 
 Forgive me not

 Forgive me, why can't I forgive me?

 Selfish ridden dead goodbyes

 Bow down 
 Surrender unto me 
 Submit infectiously 
 Sanctify your demons 
 Into abyss 
 You don't exist 
 Cannot resist 
 The Judas kiss 
 When the storm has blacked your sky 
 Intuition crucify 
 When the ego strips your reign 
 Assassinate the living flame 
 So what now? 
 Where go I? 
 When you think it's all said and done 
 Venom of a life insane 
 Bites into your fragile vein 
 Internalize and decimate 
 Patronize and complicate 
 So what now?

 Cannot resist 
 The Judas kiss 
 Judas lives, recite this vow 
 I've become your new God now 
 Followed you from dawn of time 
 Whispered thoughts into your mind 
 Watched your towers hit the ground 
 Lured your children never found 
 Helped your kings abuse their crown 
 In the heart of feeble man 
 Plant the seeds of my own plan 
 The strong and powerful will fall 
 Find a piece of me in all 
 Inside you all 
 So bow down 
 Sell your soul to me 
 I will set you free 
 Pacify your demons 
 Bow down 
 Surrender unto me 
 Submit infectiously 
 Sanctify your demons 
 Into abyss 
 You don't exist 
 Cannot resist
