 All their hopes and visions, of what they want you to be 
 Crucial times, made up minds, A.I.R. 
 So high and mighty, though much too blind to see 
 Who are you gonna live your life for? 
 Conformity will trap you like a locked door 
 Independence means owning your decisions 
 Authority will put your soul in prison 
 Fight, or go insane, there's no one else to blame 
 Stop, their influence, you can't give them a chance 
 Break, right through the wall, that separates us all 
 Start, your second life, without their hands in sight 
 You got your pride, you got your visions 
 Don't subside, don't ever give in 
 Don't compromise just keep on grinning 
 The games they play you just keep on winning 
 Keep on winning 
 Keep on winning 
 Keep on winning

 Intentions, of the truth and nothing more 
 Burn 'em, clear the streets as he rides into the town, 
 Cause the nameless one's gonna have some fun 
 He's gonna bring an outlaw down 
 Wasted, it's over quick he's nailed 'em three for three 
 Then with his squint-eyed grin and stubbled chin, 
 He rides through history 
 The jury, in his mind the choices weigh 
 The trials, if you're guilty you're his prey 
 No judgment otherwise can change the lust 
 That's in his eyes 
 The sentence, will be carried out in stride 
 No name, like a shadow on a moonless night 
 Real game, he'll be there to uphold 
 Justice, law and order 
 And you'll pay, the highest fee 
 When the gunslinger takes his piece 
 The money, it's the price you have to pay 
 When he calls, drop your eyes and look away 
 The man has taken life to balance scales 
 Of wrong and right 
 Existence, each day a moral fight"

 The public enemy's not the man who speaks his mind 
 The public enemy's the man that goes and acts blind 
 Searching for an answer that he'll never find 
 An action from reaction and you can't make a retraction 
 Once you put your head out 
 And then you're blue in the face 
 As you try to state your case 
 You can think with your dick but it can't shout 
 Yo 
 I try to understand what the hell is going on 
 I can't imagine how things ever got so far gone 
 You separatists, say you want your own state 
 I'll give them a state, a state of unconsciousness 
 Retribution, no solution, Constitution 
 Discrimination, through the nation, raining hatred 
 I yell, when there's schism you must rebel 
 I yell, so you'll hear 
 I yell, I refuse to live, in, your hell 
 I am what you fear 
 I'm the truth, I don't keep it in the family 
 Live your life, take someone else

 You can't keep it in the family

 Keep it in the, keep it in the, keep it in the,

 Don't even try to tell me what you think is right 
 When to you blacks are niggers, and Jews are kikes 
 And you expect to be taken seriously 
 But your actions, they're more than curiously 
 Juvenile, you emulate what you hate 
 And you don't even know why you feel this way 
 'Cause Daddy hated this, and Mommy hated that 
 And your own ability to reason's like a tire gone flat

 You've got the longest way to fall... 
 When you keep it in the, when you keep it in the 
 When you keep it in the family 
 When you keep it in the, when you keep it in the 
 When you keep it in the family 
 Acting out of pure cold hatred 
 'Cause of what another's race is 
 Color of another's face is 
 Different, and your own frustrations 
 Taking on a violent nature 
 Full of hate, so full of hate 
 You'd kill a man is that your fate 
 Your street becomes a police state 
 Why the hell do you hate?! 
 Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate 
 Hate, hate! 
 I'm not gonna stand for it 
 Someone's gonna pay for it

 'Cause we stretched our boundaries 
 We opened the door 
 That no one attempted before 
 Five guys in shorts, who gives a shit 
 We do what we like, we don't care where we fit 
 All you new jacks, what is it? 
 You're kidding me, get off our dicks

 Beat the beats the beats you beat 
 The only thing harder's the smell of my feet 
 So listen up close or you might get dissed 
 Go drain the lizard or take a piss... 
 Watch the beat 
 I'm on your case, I'm in your face 
 Kick you and your father back in place 
 Step off sucker understand 
 Don't you know 
 I'm the man 
 We got real def rhythms and fresh new jams 
 If ya think we've got egos well we're just hams 
 Scott plays stickball and likes to skate 
 Frankie's never on time he's always... 
 Drinking the drinks, the drinks I drank 
 I put my money in the bank 
 They cut their crack, they offer joints 
 We don't do drugs do you get our meaning... 
 Point, point, point, point, and watch the beat 
 For a heavy metal band raps a different way 
 But we like to be different and not cliche 
 Well they say rap and metal can never mix 
 Well all of them can suck our...(dicks) 
 Fart the farts the farts he farted 
 I pick my nose but I'm not retarded 
 Like El Duce says ""Smell my anal vapor"" 
 And wipe my butt, with your fuckin' face

 So, as this rap is winding down 
 It's plain to see I forgot my crown 
 You know Anthrax is number one

66,Anthrax,metal,Cowboy Song,"I am just a cowboy lonesome on the trail 
 A starry night, a campfire light 
 The coyote call, the howling winds wail 
 So I ride out to the old sundown 
 I am just a cowboy lonesome on the trail 
 Lord, I'm just thinking about a certain female 
 The nights we spent together riding on the range 
 Looking back it seems so strange 
 Roll me over and turn me around 
 Let me keep spinning till I hit the ground 
 Roll me over and let me go 
 Running free with the buffalo 
 I was took in Texas, I did not know her name 
 Lord, all these southern girls seem the same 
 Down below the border in a town in Mexico 
 I got my job busting broncs for the rodeo 
 Roll me over and turn me around 
 Let me keep spinning till I hit the ground 
 Roll me over and let me go 
 Riding in the rodeo 
 Roll me over and set me free 
 The cowboy's life is the life for me"

 Oh 
 Oh 
 Ah 
 You left 
 You're tired of family grieving 
 And you think they're sad because you're leaving 
 But did you see jealousy in the eyes 
 Of the ones who had to stay behind? 
 And do you think you've made the right decision this time? 
 You left 
 Your girlfriend on the platform 
 With this really ragged notion that you'll return 
 But she knows 
 That when he goes, he really goes 
 And do you think you've made the right decision this time?"

 Fuzzy navel y'all making me see red 
 Rapid fire Louie like Rambo got bullets 
 I'm a gonna die harder like my man Bruce Willis 
 I love girlies waxing and milking 
 Got more excuses than my man Dave Scilkin 
 Predetermined destiny is who I am 
 You got your finger on the trigger like the Son of Sam I am 
 Like Clockwork Orange going off on the town 
 I've got posse bonanza to beat your ass down 
 I'm mad at my desk and I been writing all curse words 
 Expressing my aggressions through my schizophrenic verse words

 Locked forever in a veil of shame 
 Deny extraction 
 Thirst for disgrace 
 Watch him rage 
 The emperor's killed 
 Light of the day 
 Shadows from beyond 
 Scaffold of steel 
 The door has shut 
 Dethroned emperor 
 Dethroned emperor 
 The foot of the stairs, dimension in might 
 The king sits, his eyes are glass 
 Growing of the small 
 The laughter's fall 
 Can you deny 
 Remaining cries? 
 The castle of the lords 
 Into the trap 
 Existence and hate 
 Unseen gate 
 Dethroned emperor 
 Dethroned emperor"
83,Anthrax,metal,Celebrated Summer,"Love and hate was in the air 
 Like pollen from a flower 
 Somewhere in April time 
 They add another hour 
 I guess I'd better think up a way to spend my time 
 Just when I'm ready to sit inside, it's summertime 
 Should I go fishing or get a friend to hang around 
 It's back to summer, it's back to basics, hang around 
 Getting drunk out on the beach 
 Or playing in a band 
 And getting out of school 
 And getting out of hand 
 I know, I know 
 Was this your celebrated summertime? 
 Was that your celebrated summertime? 
 Was this your celebrated summertime? 
 When the sun disintegrates between a wall of clouds 
 I summer where I winter at and no one is allowed there 
 Do you remember when the first snowfall fell 
 When summer barely had a snowball's chance in Hell? 
 Was this your celebrated summertime? 
 Was that your celebrated summertime? 
 Was this your celebrated summertime? 
 Summertime is always, always on your mind 
 Summertime is always, always on your mind 
 Summertime is always, always, always on your mind

 Tears for somebody and this lonely boy 
 Out in the madness, the all seeing eye 
 Flickers above us to light up the sky 
 Unchain the colors before my eyes 
 Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies 
 Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher 
 I shall return from out of fire"
86,Anthrax,metal,No Time This Time,"No time for the complexities of conversation 
 No time smiles, no time for knowing 
 No time for the intricacies of explanation 
 No time for sharing, even less for showing 
 If I could, I'd slow the whole world down 
 I'd bring it to it's knees 
 I'd stop it spinning 'round 
 But as it is 
 I'm climbing up an endless wall 
 No time at all 
 No time this time 
 No time at all 
 No time this time 
 No time for a quick kiss at the railway station 
 No time for a suitcase, sandwich and a morning paper 
 Only time for time tables, calls and transportation 
 No time to think, no time to dare 
 If I could, I'd slow the whole world down 
 I'd bring it to it's knees 
 I'd stop it spinning 'round

 As long 
 That was the day that I convinced myself 
 That I found my god 
 I tip my cap and I step up 
 I fix myself to the right 
 I move right into the firing zone 
 And I scream drink or fight 
 It's just a matter of respect 
 Or is that something I missed 
 This ain't no peace train that you are 
 Jumping on 
 So shake my hand and shake it strong 
 And everybody come along 
 Long, strong (am I) 
 Sometimes I can't stop the shaking 
 At least I know I'm not dead 
 I don't remember whose blood this is 
 I've got a hammer inside my head 
 I get put up, I get put down 
 And I don't even try 
 I've burned a bridge, I've burned a 
 Whole town 
 'Cause I'm fortified 
 I tell the truth or just gilded lie 
 And then I charge like a bull with his 
 Balls tied 
 A heavy dose of reality 
 With a side of piss and vinegar

 Staring at the clock 
 And my patience is wearing thin 
 One more down the gullet 
 Keeps me from jumping out of my skin 
 I'm lost in the fog of contradiction 
 I toast to the extras 
 I drink to them 'cause they don't talk to much 
 They fill up space and entertain 
 And when I cut 'em loose they don't make a fuss 
 They all add up to zero in my life 
 They're just here to cure boredom for the night 
 Now sometimes all this leaves me feeling hallow 
 That's when I take refuge with my pillow 
 I'm not even ready for confession

 Maybe that's why I touch but can't feel 
 Sittin' pretty, as I sit up straight 
 Trying to find means to an end I move into harms way 
 I move into harms way 
 I see my face in the mirror 
 I feel my feet but I can't seem to walk in my shoes 
 When it hurts I feel closer to you 
 Closer than you ever knew 
 And the bottom line is knowing 
 I will die and the worms will eat me 
 The bottom line is knowing

 Feet of clay that are stuck to the floor

 Carrying the weight of the world

 Originally performed by D.R.I. 
 No, there are no easy answers 
 To sum up the problems which we face 
 History's a lesson, let us learn by our mistakes 
 Just don't expect to make sense 
 Out of what you see 
 For I can tell you now that 
 Knowing is believing 
 So if you open your mind you might understand 
 You're the victim of a big time government scam 
 And though you may not be inclined to believe 
 The man behind the desk does get paid to deceive 
 You live in your little dream world 
 You're much too cool to care 
 I really have to warn you 
 I think it's only fair 
 They await the final hour 
 As happy as they are sick 
 Laughing so hysterically 
 At all those who they've tricked 
 Who an I to tell you who to believe in 
 When all the masks they seem so damn deceiving? 
 How can I say to you, ""You be free"" 
 That would never bring about mass anarchy 
 Now, would it? 
 From sun up to sun down 
 Decisions make my head spin round 
 Make me drunk, sick and tired 
 Keep me up 'til I retire 
 And while I could be out barhopping 
 Meat market, rocker chick shopping 
 Out there, chasing my dick 
 In it's never ending search for chicks 
 But, I'd rather be sleeping 
 In my bed, crashed out 
 A slice of death, wrapped up 
 All in wool, passed out 
 Drunk, you stupid fool 
 In my bed, crashed out 
 A slice of death, wrapped up 
 All in wool, passed out 
 Drunk, you stupid fool 
 No more waking hassles 
 Weary of the daily battles 
 So on my bed, I lay curled 
 No more waking hassles 
 Weary of the daily battles 
 So on my bed, I lay curled 
 A ""could be"" man of the world 
 But, I'd rather be sleeping 
 In my bed, crashed out 
 A slice of death, wrapped up 
 All in wool, passed out 
 Drunk, you stupid fool 
 In my bed, crashed out 
 A slice of death, wrapped up

 Crusading for hypocrisy 
 Under our nose the holy bleed 
 Crumbling under it's own weight 
 Apologies if you relate 
 'Cause 
 You cannot kill 
 What doesn't die 
 Live up to my promise 
 My full potential realized 
 Death lives right inside your pocket 
 Take him out and have a laugh 
 Go and piss your life away 
 Another ugly waste of clay 
 And up above there's no one home 
 Why don't you answer your phone? 
 Reminding me to learn that poem 
 First in last out overthrown 
 Because 
 You cannot kill 
 What doesn't die 
 Live up to my promise 
 My full potential realized 
 A stream of consciousness flows into a river of blood 
 Stem this tide of violence 
 As it rises like a flood 
 You cannot kill

 Live up to my promise

 Still you're gasping for air 
 Miles and miles you move 
 Into abyss you stare 
 Running form the plight 
 Mighty grip it's hold 
 And that hunger's hanging on 
 But never to the fold 
 With endurance 
 As the earth behind you burns 
 You can feel heat 
 Keep your will and never turn 
 Come on, follow closely 
 Come on, end this slavery 
 Come on, where you're going 
 Any place but here 
 And you pray for more hope 
 So this will run its course 
 Every day you move 
 Handcuffs they lose their force 
 Abandon all you know 
 So destitution hides 
 United in despair 
 Still makes it harder to divide 
 With exhaustion 
 As the earth behind you melts 
 You can feel heat 
 But your need for living fails 
 A logical reason for being 
 Is quickly drifting away 
 People prove fiendishly greedy 
 Each time you try to believe 
 It's hard to be defiant 
 There's ways to kill the giant 
 Slaughtered by pins"

 I've given you everything for nothing in return; 
 And I'm so tired of bleeding for the respect that I've earned 
 Because no! 
 Nobody knows! 
 Nobody knows! 
 Because nobody knows anything! 
 I don't know how much generosity that I can take; 
 Until I leave a trail of bodies lying in my wake; 
 How many times do I lose my mind till I realize; 
 Give me the high hat and you think that I should compromise? 
 'Cause it's always been a bone of contention!

 Think about an end you can live with 
 Think about an end I can give you 
 Think about an end that would satisfy 
 Think about an end you can live with

 All I see is hatred caused by years of inbred guilt 
 Resurrecting genuflecting 
 Killing in the name 
 You disavow the right to choose 
 It's medievally insane 
 Your God is dead or doesn't care 
 Tell me which one's worse 
 An uncaring God 
 Or knowing that you're unheard on this earth?

 And repulsion for this old world reality 
 Forcing fear to dominate 
 Hate a loaded gun

155,Anthrax,metal,Jailbreak,"Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak 
 Somewhere in this town 
 See me and the boys we don't like it 
 So were getting up and going down 
 Hiding low, looking right to left 
 If you see us coming, I think it's best 
 To move away, do you hear what I say 
 From under my breath 
 Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak 
 Somewhere in the town 
 Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak 
 So don't you be around 
 Don't you be around 
 Tonight there's gonna be trouble 
 Some of us won't survive 
 So, me and the boys and me mean business 
 Bustin' out dead or alive 
 I can hear the hound dogs on my trail 
 All hell breaks loose, alarm and sirens wail 
 Like the game if you lose 
 Go to jail 
 Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak 
 Somewhere in the town 
 Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak 
 So don't you be around 
 Tonight there's gonna trouble 
 I'm gonna find myself in 
 Tonight there's gonna trouble 
 So woman stay with a friend 
 You know it's safer 
 Breakout 
 Tonight there's gonna be a breakout 
 Into the city zones 
 Don't you dare try and stop us 
 No one could for long 
 Searchlight on my trail 
 Tonight's the night all systems fail 
 Hey you, good lookin' female 
 Come here 
 Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak 
 Somewhere in the town 
 Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak 
 So don't you be around 
 Tonight there's gonna be trouble 
 I'm gonna find myself in 
 Tonight there's gonna be trouble 
 So woman, stay with a friend"
156,Anthrax,metal,Love Her All I Can,"I remember the times I was lonely without her 
 Now she's mine and I spend my times dreamin' about her 
 Love her all I can and try and understand 
 The things that make her mad 
 The things that make her sad 
 I'm a lucky guy, I hardly ever cry 
 And when the world looks bad 
 She's never ever sad 
 She's so easy to please and it doesn't take money, no no 
 We can have a good time when the skies aren't sunny 
 Ah, I love her all I can and try and understand 
 The things that make her mad 
 The things that make her sad 
 I'm a lucky guy, I hardly ever cry 
 And when the world looks bad 
 She's never ever sad 
 Wow 
 I remember the times I was lonely without her 
 Now she's mine and I spend my time dreamin' about her 
 Love her all I can and try and understand 
 The things that make her mad 
 The things that make her sad 
 I'm a lucky guy, I hardly ever cry 
 And when the world looks bad 
 She's never ever sad"

158,Anthrax,metal,Next To You,"I can't stand it for another day 
 When you live so many miles away 
 Nothing here is gonna make me stay 
 Took me over, let me find a way 
 I sold my house, I sold my motor, too 
 All I want is to be next to you 
 I'd rob a bank and Maybe steal a plane 
 You took me over, think I'm goin' insane 
 What can I do? 
 All I want is to be next to you 
 What can I do? 
 All I want is to be next to you 
 I've had a thousand girls or maybe more 
 But I never felt like this before 
 But I just don't know what's come over me 
 You took me over, take a look at me 
 What can I do? 
 All I want is to be next to you 
 What can I do? 
 All I want is to be next to you 
 All I want is to be next to you 
 All I want is to be next to you 
 All I want is to be next to you 
 So many times I used to give a sign 
 Get this feeling, gonna lose my mind 
 When all it is is just a love affair 
 You took me over baby, take me there 
 What can I do? 
 All I want is to be next to you 
 What can I do? 
 All I want is to be next to you 
 What can I do? 
 All I want is to be next to you 
 What can I do? 
 All I want is to be next to you 
 (What can I do?) 
 All I want is to be next to you

 I'm running 
 I'm trying to break away 
 It's getting heavy 
 There's no way I can stay 
 I'm going under 
 It's burning up my mind 
 Release the feeling 
 I'm running out of time 
 (Raise hell, raise hell, raise hell) 
 I'm on fire 
 (raise hell, raise hell, raise hell) 
 Can't hold back desire 
 Only desire, ooh 
 I'm on the outside 
 Always looking in 
 You know the heat's on 
 And ready to begin 
 And when I'm inside 
 You stare into my eyes 
 But when it's over 
 You see through my disguise 
 (Raise hell, raise hell, raise hell) 
 I'm on fire 
 (raise hell, raise hell, raise hell) 
 Can't hold back desire 
 Only desire 
 Raise hell 
 Raise hell 
 Raise hell 
 Raise hell

162,Anthrax,metal,Bordello Of Blood,"I speed to beat the sunrise 
 Weigh a million on the road to sanity 
 My heart, my soul, my love, it's taunt 
 And I question each turn that I make in my mind 
 If I could be any other 
 Please, I'd trade make the devil, my lover 
 Pullin' my eyes, burn my eyes 
 And I'm gone, I make my move strong 
 I break and then I take it to the whore and you say 
 All the eccles in the world be mine 
 'Cause it's got me, it's got me 
 I can hear 'em laughing as a big scar marks me 
 On my own, on my own, on my own 
 I gotta go, I gotta go 
 Go home 
 Nowhere is my home 
 I've given blood for years 
 Where has it got me? 
 Dead stop on the road to sanity 
 I've seen that best that life has rock bottom works for me 
 Like a .44 caliber dose of reality 
 It's got me, it's got me 
 I can hear 'em laughing as a big scar marks me 
 On my own, on my own, on my own 
 I gotta go, I gotta go 
 Go home 
 Nowhere is my home 
 I've given blood for years 
 Where has it got me? 
 I just got to go home 
 Nowhere is my home 
 I've given blood for years 
 Where has it got me? 
 Not a damn thing 
 So I cry 
 Checking the pulse to see if I might breathe 
 Finding out if death is my date 
 State of limbo 
 Checking the pulse to find it's too late 
 Knowing now that death is my fate 
 State of limbo 
 I'm home 
 I'm home 
 I'm home 
 I'm home 
 I'm home 
 I'm home 
 I've gone home 
 I'm home 
 Go home 
 Nowhere is my home 
 I've given blood for years 
 Where has it got me? 
 I just got to go home 
 Nowhere is my home 
 I've given blood for years 
 Where has it got me?"
163,Anthrax,metal,Phantom Lord,"Sound is ripping through your ears 
 The deafening sound of metal nears 
 Your body's waiting for his whips 
 The taste of leather on your lips 
 Hear the cry of war 
 Louder than before 
 With his sword in hand 
 To control the land 
 Crushing metal strikes 
 On this frightening night 
 Fall onto your knees 
 For the Phantom Lord 
 Victims falling under chains 
 You hear them crying dying pains 
 The fist of terror breaking through 
 Now there's nothing you can do 
 Hear the cry of war 
 Louder than before 
 With his sword in hand 
 To control the land 
 Crushing metal strikes 
 On this frightening night 
 Fall onto your knees 
 For the Phantom Lord 
 The leathered armies have prevailed 
 The Phantom Lord has never failed 
 Smoke is lifting from the ground 
 The rising volume metal sound 
 Hear the cry of war 
 Louder than before 
 With his sword in hand 
 To control the land 
 Crushing metal strikes 
 On this frightening night 
 Fall onto your knees 
 For the Phantom Lord 
 Fall to your knees 
 And bow to the Phantom Lord"
164,Anthrax,metal,Poison My Eyes,"I always knew I had what it took 
 To jump over any obstacle 
 Together and separate we've been through 
 Fight for me, I'd kill for you 
 I always knew things were the same 
 But there's a caution light in your brain 
 I won't help with your cement shoes 
 If bailing out is what you choose 
 You've been spending years and years 
 Carrying your darkest fears too long 
 You've been sucked in through a whole 
 With your vision of control so long 
 If you leave your defenses down, 
 Who won't pick you up? 
 Poison My Eyes 
 Better men have tried, tried to bring me down 
 A man is a man is a man you can't see clear 
 Now you're forced to hear 
 All that you dread, better to keep it in 
 Believe it's what you deserve 
 You make me feel everything I do 
 Better than me, a thousand times as you 
 All endurances leave you behind 
 As you disconnect from the grind 
 Drowning in your own denial 
 It's a simple as a smile 
 One is strong, one insecure 
 Who dies first in our private war? 
 You've been spending years and years 
 Carrying your darkest fears too long 
 You've been falling through a hole 
 Now your vision of control is gone 
 Be dangerous, unpredictable and make a lot of noise!"

 Originally performed by KISS 
 She walks by moonlight 
 No one really knows 
 Enchanted starlight 
 Never goin' home 
 I know she's goin' down, goin' 
 Everybody knows she's so good 
 Doin' well for others 
 She doesn't really know 
 The powers are within her 
 As she takes off her clothes 
 I know she's goin' down, goin' 
 Everybody knows she's so good 
 Doin' well for others 
 She doesn't really know 
 The powers are within her 
 As she takes off her clothes 
 I know she's goin' down, goin' 
 Everybody knows she's so good"
166,Anthrax,metal,Destroyer,"(Snider) 
 Twisted Forever (Twisted Sister tribute album) 
 He spent his life 
 A silent sentinel 
 For all to fear 
 He walks, he talks, he thinks, he feels 
 But no one dare to go near 
 He takes in all he sees 
 Nothing escapes his gaze 
 And when he strikes 
 He strikes for right 
 A glourious sight 
 Destroyer, Destroyer, 
 Destroyer 
 He's in town 
 He came to be 
 From a grand mistake 
 A mystical charade 
 Created to decide the good 
 And reprecussive aid 
 As awardness filled his fame 
 He examined those who leered 
 Then he cleaved the air 
 With his fiery stare 
 Rend all those there 
 Destroyer, Destroyer, 
 Destroyer 
 He's in town 
 Destroyer, Destroyer, 
 Destroyer 
 He's in town 
 A day will come 
 You'll be drawn into 
 The center of your town 
 A came upon a mass of steel 
 The cracks the very ground 
 Prepare to meet your judge 
 Don't think to run away 
 Just pray your face 
 Holds no disgrace 
 For the deadly ace 
 Destroyer, Destroyer, 
 Destroyer 
 He's in town 
 Destroyer, Destroyer, Destroyer 
 He's in town"
167,Anthrax,metal,It's Late,"You say you love me and I hardly know your name 
 And if I say I love you in the candlelight 
 There's no one but myself to blame 
 But there's something inside that's turning my mind away 
 Woah, I could love you if I could let you stay 
 (It's late) 
 And I'm bleeding deep inside 
 (It's late) 
 Is it just my stickly pride 
 (Too late) 
 Even now the feeling seems to slip away 
 (So late) 
 Though I'm crying I can't help you but hear you say 
 (It's late, it's late, it's late)

 But after all this time, the more I'm trying 
 The more I seem to let you down, yeah

 Though you know I can't be true 
 Oh you made me love you 
 Don't tell me that we're through

 And it's driving me so mad 
 (It's late) 
 Yes I know but don't try to tell me that it's 
 (Too late) 
 Save our love you can't turn out the light 
 (So late) 
 I've been wrong but I'll learn to be right 
 (It's late, it's late, it's late)

 I've been so long 
 You've been so long 
 We've been so long trying to work it out 
 I ain't got long 
 You ain't got long 
 We've gotta know what this life's all about 
 Try to work it out 
 Too late 
 Much too late 
 You're staring at me with suspicion in your eye 
 Was that a game you were playing? 
 What's this that your saying? 
 I know that I can't reply 
 If I take you tonight 
 Is it making my life a lie? 
 Oh you know you make me wonder 
 Did I live my life alright 
 (It's late) 
 But it's time to set me free 
 (It's late) 
 Yes I know but there's no way it has to be 
 (Too late) 
 So let the fire take our bodies this night 
 (So late) 
 So let the waters take our guilt in the tide 
 (It's late, it's late, it's late, it's late 
 It's late, it's late, it's late, it's late) 
 Oh, it's all too late 
 Too late, too late 
 It's all late

 So I string you up to keep you hanging around 
 You dish the hot stuff up but you keep me waiting
