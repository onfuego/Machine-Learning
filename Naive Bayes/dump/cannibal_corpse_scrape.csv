 Hidden of the prying eyes' curiosity

 His head is rotting but his body lives on as a worthless vegetable 
 Unknown to mankind, the incredible power of his mind 
 Hideous heredity, genetic imbalance, resorting to cannibalism 
 A feast begins as the patients skull is cracked open like a walnut 
 Brains devoured in a frenzied slaughter, thirst for gore nothing more 
 Bile is dripping, puss from wounds, as the coroner drinks it down 
 The sights before your eyes you can't describe 
 A trip through this living hell will rot away your skull 
 Genital lasceration, anal asphyxiation 
 Blockage of bowel passage, defication, haemmorhage 
 Cadaverous mutalation, metamorphial radiation 
 Devourance of arteries, decapitated extremeties 
 Cranial excavation, cerebral liquidation

 Shredded cartilage victim lies

 Prophecy of the wisemen of old 
 Now comes true, as the corpses break the soil 
 Ancient spell breaks the sleep of the dead 
 The dead awake, what the populace is fearing 
 Panic strikes as the nations run in fear 
 Oceans boil with blood of human victims 
 Suicide, the only way to avoid being eaten by the undead 
 Grave yards coming alive with zombies, hungry for living flesh 
 Psychotic, transmuted corpses, upsuring the population 
 Sickening disaster of epidemic proportions, devouring us 
 Tables turn as a victim I've become now 
 State of death only waiting to return 
 Vital signs that show I'm dead 
 This can't happen, I'm rising from my own grave 
 Hunger grows not nutritionnal but instinctual 
 Flesh becomes my only crave of this live 
 Unthinking state, a state of metamorphosis 
 Seeking food to keep me dead 
 Degenerate, a product of man's frustration for his error 
 Insatiable hunger for mankind, building with each kill 
 Seeking human victims to meet my fill 
 Cannibal I've become, what's happened to my brain 
 Feast on the corpse, suck out his brain 
 As its fluids drip down the drain 
 Chew on the bones, drink from its bladder 
 The vile stench only makes me madder

 Violent surge, a spear through the skull 
 Felt the urge, now my heart's full 
 I crave gore, I'll eat your guts 
 I love gore, blood drives me nuts 
 I drink blood, I don't like water 
 Intestines my cud, I feast in the slaughter

 What a rotting stench 
 My imagination runs wild at what it could be 
 Open up the can to discover a dead body 
 Or what was left of one, pieces in a bag 
 Blood is everywhere what a retched sight 
 Cut up really small by a razor sharp knife 
 Lying in the garbage no one else knows 
 What I have found, what should I do 
 Take it to the police or make it into stew 
 This was an evil committed by the insane 
 Looking down laughing, I am the same 
 The sight of death drives me nuts, I must kill 
 To control my brain 
 Swept away by my lust to cause pain, 
 Mutilation is my only want 
 The evil inside me gives me the strength 
 To kill at will 
 My life is the means to cause death 
 In the most sinister way 
 I see it in your eyes the fear that keeps me alive 
 I'll take it away, your life will end today 
 I'll leave you to rot, what a sick odor 
 Scream all you want, but you can't stop this horror 
 Tasting your life as I drink your blood 
 Ripping out your insides, chewing on your spleen

 Violent ways of insanity, there is no end to this cruelty 
 In my grasp, I'll kill you fast, I'll send your soul to hell 
 Butchery of Human beings is the only life I know 
 My armies of zombies will inherit the earth, and answer to my spells 
 Mutilate the human race in search for immortals

 Incantation of the devil to rob it of its soul 
 Consume the lifeless cadaver, I drink your blackened blood

 I slice through the limb, a human dissection 
 Portions of half-eaten flesh in my mouth 
 Starting to chew your now bleeding stump 
 I will swallow your pus your own rectal slime 
 I'll force you to drink 
 Vessels explode as needles injected 
 My brain tormented 
 Slit from head to toe, die through the torture 
 Disease engulfs you 
 Internal rot 
 Fresh cut wounds, beginning to clot 
 Ripping through flesh is what I do best 
 Tear off an arm, amputated neck 
 Eyes removed, cranium smashed 
 Decomposing remains, severed in half 
 Dying slowly never to rest, nerves are quivering as I rip 
 Removal of life on the blade of my knife 
 Inserted in your spine, smashing through bone 
 Feel my hell, I feed on fright 
 Rape the limbless cadaver"

 Hungry for the blood 
 Life is to decay 
 Victims meet my blade, carving out organs 
 A world of pain and terror 
 Visions of the future 
 Premonition of the evil, forthcoming eve of darkness 
 The chosen one will come 
 Eyes torn out bodies cut in half 
 Twisted corpses hang from broken necks 
 Demented madman 
 Unholy rampage 
 Impaled cranium beginning to drain 
 Sodomize the carcass, chew the anal rot 
 Sewn within the body the dark becomes my light 
 Live inside the shell 
 Feed upon infection 
 At one with the dead 
 I rip my way through 
 Easy prey, disfigured bodies decompose 
 Chewed limbs drip with pus, intestinal strangulation 
 Humans left ripped apart 
 Lap up the dripping goo 
 Wretched chunks of bleeding flesh 
 Internally you rot away 
 My need to kill 
 Induced by hate, betrayal of trusted ones 
 My mark left on this earth, victims of my slaughter 
 Souls of my dead, murdered by my 
 Hand 
 Blood on my face, innards decay 
 Snapping necks chewing flesh 
 Insatiable thirst 
 For blood 
 Slicing throats viciously uncontrollable insanity 
 Tear out the beating heart 
 Engulf the quivering spleen, chew the meat

 It's, it's coming out 
 I feel like killing you 
 Let loose the anger, held back too long 
 My blood runs cold 
 Through my anatomy, dwells another being 
 Rooted in my cortex, a servant to its bidding 
 Brutality now becomes my appetite 
 Violence is now a way of life 
 The sledge my tool to torture 
 As it pounds down on your forehead 
 Eyes bulging from their sockets 
 With every swing of my mallet 
 I smash your fucking head in, until brains seep in 
 Through the cracks, blood does leak 
 Distorted beauty, catastrophe 
 Steaming slop, splattered all over me 
 Lifeless body, slouching dead 
 Lecherous abcess, where you once had a head 
 Avoiding the prophecy of my new found lust 
 You will never live again, soon your life will end 
 I'll see you die at my feet, eternally I smash your face 
 Facial bones collapse as I crack your skull in half 
 Crushing, cranial, contents 
 Draining the snot, I rip out the eyes 
 Squeezing them in my hands nerves are incised 
 Peeling the flesh off the bottom of my weapon 
 Involuntarily pulpifying facial regions 
 Suffer, and then you die 
 Torture, pulverized 
 At one with my sixth sense, I feel free 
 To kill as I please, no one can stop me 
 Created to kill, the carnage continues 
 Violently reshaping human facial tissue 
 Brutality becomes my appetite 
 Violence is now a way of life 
 The sledge my tool to torture 
 As it pounds down on your forehead"

 Twisted and half decayed

 I pissed in her maggot filled asshole 
 Fucking the rotting 
 My semen is bleeding 
 The smell of decay 
 Seeps from her genital cavity 
 The smell was unbearable as I unburied her 
 I cum blood from my erection 
 I feel it run 
 Down her throat, swallow 
 Eyes glassy and vacant 
 Body dug up to play with 
 Skin greasy and naked 
 Tonguing her rotted anus 
 I need a live woman 
 To fill with my fluid 
 A delicate girl, to mutilate, fuck and kill 
 Her body exceptional 
 She thought I was normal 
 But I wanted more 
 I came blood inside of her 
 Choking on the clot 
 Gagging on my snot 
 Gushing blood, from her mouth 
 Bloody gel leaking out 
 Body buried in a shallow grave 
 Unmarked for none to find 
 The sickness I have left behind 
 Undetected go my crimes 
 The greatest thrill of my life 
 Was hacking my hard cock with a knife 
 Violent, climax 
 Serging serum 
 On my skin 
 Back from the dead 
 I am resurrected 
 To spew, putrification"
22,Cannibal Corpse,metal,Addicted To Vaginal Skin,"A relapse of my body

 Are his now 
 His evil consuming me 
 Ever telling me 
 Begin the clit carving

 By the vaginal skins of young women

 Rotted 
 After I sucked the blood from her ass 
 I feel more alive 
 More alive than I've ever been 
 Even though now I'm dead within 
 My mouth drools 
 As I slice your perinium 
 My body smeared 
 With the guts I've extracted 
 Through her hole, came swollen organs 
 Cunnilingus with the mutilated 
 My spirit returned from the dead 
 Released by the priest 
 But I felt more real 
 When I was dead 
 The curse is broken 
 I have a dependence on vaginal skin 
 It's become my sexual addiction 
 I must slit, the twitching clit 
 Rotted cavity hold the juice 
 Between the legs, I love to carve

23,Cannibal Corpse,metal,Split Wide Open,"Melting thoughts of disintegration 
 Hitting deep her insistence 
 To mutilate her newborn infants 
 After giving birth her mind wasn't the same 
 Slowly slipping away, a state of mental decay 
 Family now complete 
 Father watches on 
 As mother dismembers her newborn son 
 Dissecting the specimen, split I will explore, the 
 Body wide open 
 Uncover carnage within, split wide open 
 Virgin, untouched skin 
 Releasing her rage 
 That dwells inside 
 Tainted blood rushes through veins 
 Her body chemically changed 
 Love was erased, on the edge of a butcher's knife 
 The kitchen becomes a makeshift slaughterhouse 
 Every nine months she butchers one more child 
 Reminders of the deceased, scattered through the home 
 Bones and skulls of sons and daughters 
 Genitals ferment 
 In jars inside the cupboards 
 For father to dissect 
 No one will discover the murder they commit 
 Children used like laboratory rats 
 Sickening vulgar experiments 
 She sees what others can't 
 Probing the guts of her fetus 
 Advocation of the pain 
 Mutilating, draining veins 
 Witness the horror 
 Offering to themselves 
 Continuing murdering their own kind 
 Never deny this fantasy life, they enjoy 
 Addiction to this heightened state 
 Post-birth psychosis 
 Disjointing her own children 
 Form the life they'll never live 
 A massacre within her soul 
 Struggling for control"
24,Cannibal Corpse,metal,Necropedophile,"I was once a man before I transformed 
 Into this molester, freshly deceased children 
 You have born, torn by my rape 
 The dead are not safe, the lifeless child corpse 
 I will violate 
 Pleasure from the dead, complete satisfaction 
 I open the coffin 
 Sick thoughts run through my head as I stare 
 At the dead, over and over, I can't escape 
 I begin the dead sex, licking her young, rotted orifice 
 I cum in her cold cunt, shivering with ecstasy 
 For nine days straight I do the same 
 She becomes by dead, decayed child sex slave 
 Her neck I hack, cutting through the back 
 I use her mouth to eject 
 Here I cum, blood gushes from 
 Bleeding black blood 
 Her head disconnected 
 As I came, viciously I cut, through her jugular vein 
 She's already dead, I masturbate with her severed head 
 My lubrication, her decomposition 
 Spending my life molesting dead children 
 Intercourse with infants 
 Curing heads on top of spikes 
 Boiling skulls 
 Skin sliding off of bones 
 Voices 
 The voices call 
 Voices 
 The voices are calling me 
 Buried dead I've spiritually infected 
 Call to me from beyond their graves 
 Bleed 
 I now bleed pus 
 I bleed, the blood of the dead 
 I bleed on her livid skin 
 Thrusting myself within 
 Beginning to chop through her hairless crotch 
 Beyond what we know as death 
 It haunts me everyday 
 I hear the voice of every child 
 That lies next to me decayed 
 A fresh corpse, to fill with my infection 
 Tortured before death, no orifice left unfilled 
 Violated after death

 Anal pore spewing cess 
 The sacred juice I injest 
 Your dead child I defile

25,Cannibal Corpse,metal,The Cryptic Stench,"Tearing at my neck my sharpened teeth pierce the meat 
 My warm bloodied prey sustains my life for one more day 
 The oldest of souls, left behind after life 
 Before death I was nothing but human 
 Indulgence in the blood, intoxicated from its drug 
 It warms my cold soul 
 Tapping the gushing sap, trickling down my throat 
 Rejuvenation of my body 
 No blood left to scab 
 Now it flows through my veins 
 Heaven I have found 
 Fear in my grip 
 Transcend beyond mortal 
 The sweet blood 
 I will swallow 
 Draining the inner spirit 
 Feasting on the power 
 Knowing only pleasure 
 Human blood I devour 
 Ghastly beauty look into my eyes 
 To reproduce with the living 
 Every century 
 Impregnation of the virgin 
 I drink the blood of the unborn 
 Returning to my grave 
 Dragging my blood drained prey 
 My body burns from the light 
 Sleeping until night 
 In my clutch, you greet me with open arms 
 Soon I will rip them off 
 And drink the blood from the stumps 
 Life and death are too clear 
 But mankind is blind to see 
 The twisted path of their own mortality 
 Scripts of the dead 
 Netherworld knowledge 
 Rotten fragrance lingers 
 Unleash the odor

 Resurrect him so I can 
 Drink his blood again"
26,Cannibal Corpse,metal,Entrails Ripped From A Virgin's Cunt,"Alive alone now that they've gone dead but unburied 
 I've seen it unfold, terrible scenes of agony 
 Eyes in the darkness 
 Echoing their madness 
 The sights that have passed before them 
 Watching as though it has never happened 
 Now I only listen to what is not spoken 
 Murder, hatred 
 Anger, savage 
 Killings I have caused 
 More than can be counted 
 Orgies of sadism 
 And sexual perversion 
 Virgin 
 Tied to my mattress 
 Legs spread wide 
 Ruptured bowel, yanked 
 From her insides 
 Devirginized with my knife 
 Internally bleeding 
 Vagina, secreting 
 Her blood-wet pussy 
 I am eating 
 On her guts I am feeding 
 Mutilated with a machete 
 I fucked her dead body 
 The first and last 
 Your life's only romance 
 My knife's jammed in your ass 
 As you die you orgasm 
 Pass on to the dead 
 Nerve trembling convulsions 
 No longer looking human 
 I never see them, but I know they're there 
 Locked in my subconscious 
 Obscene memories I thought I'd forgotten 
 Haunting unrealities 
 Tear at me 
 Hold her arms 
 Her mouth taped shut 
 Screams unheard 
 Out pour her guts 
 Layers of flesh peeling away 
 Languish in your own decay 
 Descriptions of my killings 
 Bone chilling 
 Terror, tear her 
 Virgin cunt 
 Virgins are my victims 
 Their tight interiors I explore 
 Sharpened utensils of torture 
 Now inserted inside of her 
 Sex organs extracted for eating 
 On her liver I am gnawing 
 Forbidden lust for guts 
 Ripped from her cunt 
 Tears of blood cry down her thigh 
 I ram my fist inside her hole 
 From her crotch piss now flows 
 Rectum filled with shit 
 I fucked her emptied body 
 Until she became stiff"
27,Cannibal Corpse,metal,Post Mortal Ejaculation,"Suffering my only need now is to hang 
 The rope does swing, hanging from the darkened ceiling 
 Strangling, dangling from my twisted spine 
 I knew I would enjoy death more than life 
 My lids close tight, but the light blinds my eyes 
 My body grows cold - my cock becomes erect 
 Watching over my dead shell, from beyond in my own hell 
 Caught between life and death, even though my body's dead 
 I still feel the touch of flesh 
 Given the choice to die or live dead 
 Purgatory my damnation 
 Climaxing at the resurrection 
 Adipocere spurts from my erection 
 Manifested in my rotted body 
 Unpure spirit, dead among mortals 
 I have risen from self-murder 
 Only to rot and kill 
 To break the necks of young women 
 Their cunts my pus will fill 
 Acid burning through her crotch 
 I baptize her face with my rot 
 Then venom foams from her throat 
 On my discharge she will choke 
 Pulsation, my heart begins to beat 
 Heaving, goiters start to secrete 
 Caustic odor, steaming gruel 
 Wallow in my infected drool 
 Swollen pussing gashes 
 Start to reek 
 Puncture wounds in the back 
 Hacked up limbs, bones now crack 
 Skin fillet from your face 
 Breasts gouged out 
 I fuck with your chest"

 Enhancing the imagination

 Killing off generations 
 Families torn to pieces

 Of your hacked up family 
 Their spirits are trapped 
 Beyond the cemetery 
 Bodies rotting, but I'm not sleeping 
 Scream you're not dreaming

 Form this nightmare

 A world of darkness forever sleeping in this coffin

 Despite my pain I am able 
 To grab a lighter on the counter 
 The flint ignites, the flames erupt 
 I'm consumed in the inferno 
 Cauterize, my skin is charred 
 Regenerate, more loathsome than before 
 I despise what I see in the mirror

 The sand tastes like blood 
 Savagely cruel, barren expanse, the atmosphere, 
 A caustic fog

 Dust of dried blood filling my lungs

 Begins to beat 
 Suddenly a flash, specter of the past 
 Vision of mass murder, torrents of blood 
 The vision quickly ends, 
 The wasteland still beckons 
 Plodding toward the chasm

 The massacre I behold 
 An infinite river of cadavers, 
 Buoyant in their own blood 
 Vertigo engulfs my brain as 
 My body fails and drops 
 A million corpses staring 
 Straining to survive, 
 Limbs flailing in the blood 
 Grapple with headless bodies 
 Hands of the dead are pulling me downward 
 Drowning in this river 
 Intestines are alive, like tentacles they choke 
 Situation hopeless 
 I submit to the fury of the river 
 Paralyzed with terror 
 Thousands of their thoughts 
 Are entering my mind 
 Conscious on their level 
 Every tortured death is experienced at once 
 Drowning in their anguish

 In seconds they were slain 
 Daggers in my hands are killing 
 This worthless piece of shit 
 Hate for them still drives my rage 
 My job is almost finished only one remains 
 In the corner terrified behind the grisly slaughter 
 Ill take my time on this last scum bag 
 Knife in stomach, hes not dead yet 
 Carving up his body, gouge his fucking head 
 Chop off his arms, pull out his guts

 From behind, pain shivering down my spine 
 I feel paralyzed, only controlling my mind 
 Strapped to the table, naked, genitals exposed 
 Eyes clamped open, mouth gagged shut, terrified 
 Locks my scrotum in a vice and tightens forcefully 
 Agony, silent screams, want to die 
 Shackled and bound, unaware my fate 
 Destined to be maimed to stimulate 
 The skin is peeled off my dick 
 Done with a razor blade 
 She begins to suck 
 Blood and cum amok 
 She rips my cock off with her teeth

 You watch your hands cut off 
 Then your legs 
 The one that you betrayed 
 Will kill you this way 
 Scarred by the bastards 
 I will kill you 
 Killed by my rage 
 I must kill you

 Warm blood sprays out 
 The gushing entices 
 Pull out your heart

 Shove in your mouth 
 Then stab your crotch

 You death averted my becoming insane

 Hose the floor and clean the room 
 Anywhere they bled 
 Into boxes go the bags 
 Fill the space with rocks 
 In the dark of night 
 He throws them off the docks 
 Rotting in the river 
 Never to be found 
 Under tons of concrete 
 Deep beneath the ground 
 From behind he grabs his mouth 
 The blade goes to his neck 
 Bulging veins pumping blood 
 He struggles to protect 
 If you don't cut open the stomach 
 The corpse will rise and float 
 The victim is discovered dead 
 Rotting organs bloat 
 The killer chops the body 
 With a scalpel and an ax 
 The parts are then drained 
 And put into the sacks 
 Grab the neck, Slit the throat, take the life 
 Hang the corpse - Prepare to drain the blood 
 Bone saw, meat cleaver, filleting knife 
 Carve the corpse - Dissect him in the tub 
 Smash the teeth, slice off scars, crush the bones 
 With a crowbar - scrape off all tattoos 
 If you don't cut open the stomach 
 The corpse will rise and float 
 The victim is discovered dead 
 Rotting organs bloat 
 The killer chops the body 
 With a scalpel and an ax 
 The parts are then drained 
 And put into the sacks 
 Chunks of a skull 
 Sawn in half bones 
 Body is found 
 Killer unknown

 Young blood is so pure 
 Unborn infant is dead premature

 This summons to die has been given to you for accepting my hate 
 Stabbed in the throat

 Your body is now life deprived 
 Vocal cords twitching, esophagus severed, a hemorrhaging brain 
 Your lacerated jugular vein is spurting away 
 As mortality fades I am ready to flay your whole body and head 
 Vigorously carving this fresh human flesh, I am one with the dead 
 Stabbed in the throat 
 For no reason but to kill, for no reason but the thrill 
 You must die for me to survive 
 Stabbed in the throat 
 I believe in sacrifice, sliced open with my knife 
 Your body is now life deprived 
 I'm chewing bloody skin from the cadaver 
 Consuming lifeless meat, mangled and tattered 
 Half-eaten corpse lies skinless in the gutter 
 I am revitalized 
 Odium, embedded in my skull 
 To kill and eat your prey a way of nature 
 The taste of death must consciously be savored 
 My cannibal existence never dangered 
 Just look into my eyes 
 Subjugate, intensity to blame 
 Gnawing on the head, sliced to fucking shreds 
 Knife to the gullet results in cessation

 (Lyrics: Mazurkiewicz) 
 (Vocal patters: Fisher, Mazurkiewicz) 
 Drawn to an act of complete domination 
 Violent urges of decapitation 
 Premeditated murder, invidious 
 Soon she will be vanquished, insidious 
 Headless 
 Headless 
 Headless 
 Abscission of her head is what I'm craving 
 I will become her homicidal savior 
 Headless 
 Headless

 Headless 
 Tainting of the mind, need to obliterate 
 Inhumanity, desire to decolate 
 Utmost frustration or totally insane 
 Either way, in my hands, I will crush her brain 
 Tainting of the mind, need to obliterate 
 Inhumanity, desire to decolate 
 Utmost frustration or totally insane 
 Either way, in my hands, I will crush her brain 
 Preparing for medieval demise 
 A make-shift guillotine out of burcher knives 
 I'll watch her body quiver from the chaos 
 Peel off her face and frantically chew her eyes 
 She finally enters my dwelling of sin 
 It'll be done in a matter of minutes 
 As I embrace her for one last single time 
 In horror I realize, death is mine 
 I feel the cold blade pierce the back of my neck 
 The blood spews incessantly, flooding my face 
 Convulsions and spasms as life fades away 
 Ironically, I'm the one with no head 
 Headless

62,Cannibal Corpse,metal,Every Bone Broken,"(Music: Owen) 
 (Lyrics, vocal patterns: Mazurkiewicz) 
 Die, shattered you'll die 
 Bones broken in half 
 Blood flowing freely 
 Limbs severed in hate 
 Brains splattered, demise 
 Skin eaten in wrath 
 Eyes ripped from your head 
 Lie shattered, you die 
 For believing you could be free 
 Weakness only invigorates me 
 These broken bones once yours, I hold 
 Cause of death will never unfold 
 Torn, mangled, and maimed 
 Life withers away 
 In hellish decay 
 Bones shattered, you die 
 For not seeing things I see 
 Your pummeled body strengthens me 
 These broken bones keep me aware 
 Of how I lust to shred and tear 
 Every bone broken is my only goal 
 Sucking the marrow of your fractured femurs 
 Every bone broken, your truculent toll 
 Succumbling to my offensive demeanor 
 Every bone broken enhances my soul 
 Your twisted corpse is contorted dead rot 
 Every bone broken, your life I stole 
 I'll kill again and I'll never get caught 
 (Solo - O'Brien) 
 The snapping and cracking of skeletal remains 
 The pleasure of devouring decomposed flesh 
 The feeling of power from crushing your skull 
 The stench of decay overwhelming my brain 
 I slaughtered your body and returned it to dirt 
 Not a trace of proof that you ever existed 
 Pure satisfaction through what I have accomplished 
 I'll kill again and I'll never get caught"

 Screwdriver repeatedly lands in his face 
 Gouges and hacks at the man of disgrace 
 Tearing off muscles from the bones of his chest 
 Rending his flesh with rage I've been blessed 
 Chopped off the tongue that told the lies 
 I spit on him and laugh while he dies 
 Lying there helpless I throw brick at your head 
 Starving for violence and now I've been fed 
 His blood drips from my mouth 
 I bit his larynx out 
 Biting off fingers when he tried to push me back 
 His blood drips from my mouth 
 I bit his larynx out 
 Biting off fingers when he tried to push me back 
 Chopping at his face in hate, I gouge and hack 
 Crushing the despised 
 Under my boot I hear your bones crack 
 So many things that you want to take back 
 I won't forget and I won't forgive 
 Not so long as I allow you to live 
 Chopped off the tongue that told the lies 
 I spit on him and laugh while he dies 
 Lying there helpless I throw brick at your head 
 Starving for violence and now I've been fed 
 His blood drips from my mouth 
 I bit his larynx out 
 Biting off fingers when he tried to push me back

 Biting off fingers when he tried to push me back 
 Chopping at his face in hate, I gouge and hack

 She will soon die, her soul is still pure 
 Her body is trembling it's filled with fear 
 She'll lose the life which she holds dear 
 The dagger is ready to do it's evil deed 
 On her decayed corpse I will feed 
 Tie her legs and arms ready to read the rite 
 Now I feel the force of Satan's might 
 Under baphomet she is bleeding fast 
 With the corpse indulge in a bloodbath 
 Pray to the master that this will suffice 
 Split her skull for this altar sacrifice 
 Tears on her cheek, sweat on her brow 
 It's time to die I will kill her now 
 Death has come to deliver her fate

 Reborn creature, malicious being 
 Resurgance of a grusome species 
 With carnal obsession, it lusts copulation 
 Scent of fresh human blood invades its dominion 
 Surrounded in darkness, she enters a realm of hell 
 Infernal quest from a savage of death 
 Brutal attack, the innocent are unprotected 
 Hellish fury, deviance provides conception 
 Vicicious onslaught, its primal lust instinctual 
 Macabe fuckfest, inside her cunt, the brute's erection 
 Raped by the beast 
 Anamialistic, pure hideous appearance 
 Repulsive re-existence, bearer of morbidity

 From beyond, bring the parish doom 
 From the ground they rise 
 Plundering the grave

 Fighting for mouthfuls of flesh 
 Invading the tombs of the recently buried, to feast

 Of killing in so man ways, homicidal 
 Seeking redemption through rage 
 With hacksaws I decapitated them all 
 Blood covers the groud, my feet are saturated 
 Rotting flesh scattered around, I feel no remorse 
 I don't remember my name 
 Or when blood of the dead flowed so relentlessly 
 Extracting the brains from the skulls 
 My anger evolves with the more heads I deform 
 Sawing the neck I am engulfed in fantasy 
 Chew the esophagus, cannibal delicacy 
 Utterly execerbated, forver deleterious 
 Slicing through skin, sundered larynx, veins spraying blood 
 Tattered windpipe, facial carvings, another head to abhore <?> 
 Beheading sustains my desire 
 Enhancing my primitive mind 
 Annihilation without repreving

 Retribution was sought by the ones he had slain

 Rotted and gaunt

 With the victis of his knife, he is now beset 
 Reliving every crime 
 Condemned to agony 
 No escape from their hate 
 Condemned to agony, agony 
 He thought he got away 
 His crimes unpunished he took them to the grave 
 Their tortured souls are waiting 
 Now they make him pay 
 Exact their revenge using methods that he used 
 To make him understand them 
 To chop him up 
 Is their revenge 
 With no remorse 
 They slash him, disfigure 
 Undying hate 
 His torment endless 
 He's torn apart and they cut the pieces smaller 
 The knife he used to maim 
 Is turned against him and now they will do the same 
 Dissect the man of evil 
 His fingers are cut off 
 And forced into his mouth so that he cannot scream 
 And in pain they revel

 Pride left them defenseless

 Spent of all their energy now worthless and degraded 
 Slow death is the only thing left for them

 Enshrining the bodies, evil emerging

 We adhere to the holy text 
 More must die if we are to advance

 With blood we praise his epic acts of hate and homicidal glory, legendary murders 
 Trust in our lord 
 Leads us to kill in the same way that he did, sever all the heads in sacrificial splendor

 Soon he will be among us leading, violence, ruin, divinity, homicide 
 Kneeling in the blood, we see our master watching 
 Look behind his eyes, a soul so ruthless, perfect 
 Transfixed by his gaze, his congregation waiting

 Knuckles bleed from shards of teeth 
 Smash his skull onto the pavement

 Contributing blood continuosly 
 Bleach the stains 
 Forward to entropy 
 Luminol reveals the truth 
 Blood spatter throughout the entire room 
 Virtue is choked out by foul ambition 
 Welcome to the killing room 
 Enter the scene, horrific violence, deceptive pretense 
 Feeble attempt to mislead with false evidence, corpus delicti 
 Capricious malevolence 
 No body, no homicide 
 Imaginary intruder 
 Contributing blood continuosly 
 Bleach the stains 
 Forward to entropy"
167,Cannibal Corpse,metal,Scavenger Consuming Death,"Hammers swing, cracking their skulls 
 Blades slash, spraying their blood 
 He waits, watching them kill 
 When they're done, he will feed 
 Scavenger consuming death 
 Yield of violence gives him life 
 Scavenger consuming death 
 Parasite awaits your demise 
 Viscera, torsos torn 
 Chopping off legs and arms 
 Sounds of violence draw him near 
 Soon he'll feed, soon he'll feed 
 Scavenger consuming death 
 Yield of violence gives him life 
 Scavenger consuming death 
 Parasite awaits your demise 
 Scavenger consuming death 
 Body parts and severed heads 
 Scavenger consuming death 
 Human vulture seeks your end 
 Scavenger 
 Gruesome forager 
 Tracking murderers 
 What they leave behind will feed this ghoulish fiend 
 Cannibal 
 Waits for you to fall 
 Insatiable 
 Your mangled corpse will soon become his latest meal 
 They have died 
 Eat their flesh 
 Before they rot 
 Gnaw and tear 
 The fresh meat 
 Leave only bones 
 A morbid harvest, once alive 
 Murdered, butchered, eaten, they're gone 
 Exploit the carnage, he survives 
 Hunting, waiting, reaping, death's spawn 
 Eat them all 
 Scavenger consuming death 
 Yield of violence gives him life 
 Scavenger consuming death 
 Parasite awaits your demise 
 Scavenger consuming death 
 Body parts and severed heads 
 Scavenger consuming death 
 Human vulture seeks your end"
168,Cannibal Corpse,metal,In The Midst Of Ruin,"The present has become the past 
 Mayhem and chaos foreboding 
 Brought back to the dark ages 
 Modern technology wiped from the earth 
 A world darkened once again 
 In the midst of ruin we will be 
 Anarchy 
 Malicious indifference ruling the land 
 You'd better be ready to die 
 It's kill or be killed 
 Barely surviving through primitive warfare 
 Only the strongest will thrive 
 I will not be killed 
 Every man for himself 
 Most of them turn to suicide 
 The populace forced to revert 
 Lacking in normalcy 
 Anarchy 
 In the midst of ruin 
 Most life will cease to exist 
 Malicious indifference ruling the land 
 You'd better be ready to die 
 It's kill or be killed 
 Barely surviving through primitive warfare 
 Only the strongest will thrive 
 I will not be killed 
 The present has become the past 
 Mayhem and chaos foreboding 
 Brought back to the dark ages 
 Modern technology wiped from the earth 
 A world darkened once again 
 In the midst of ruin we will be 
 Anarchy"
169,Cannibal Corpse,metal,Destroyed Without A Trace,"Festering morbid decay 
 Saturates the air again 
 Stenches of a different pleasure 
 Boiling blood hole deepens 
 Filled with remains, once pitiful lives 
 Slaughtered day by day 
 Die without a face 
 Destroyed without a trace 
 Vanished when unfit for life 
 Betrayal not uncommon 
 Severed for the sacrifice 
 Appease the inner demon 
 Filled with remains, once pitiful lives 
 Boiling blood hole deepens 
 Die without a face 
 Destroyed without a trace 
 Given away 
 Life is taken away 
 Coordinate the mutilations 
 Simplify the deviance 
 Rectify the situation 
 Bodies chopped with diligence 
 Discarded humans melting fast 
 Enveloped in putrid vapor 
 Slaughtered day by day 
 Destroyed without a trace 
 Given away 
 Life is taken away 
 Morbid decay 
 In vain they have suffered and died 
 Gathered for the execution, brutal murders one by one begin 
 They will die, they will die, they will die, they will die 
 Dissected for incineration, chosen for annihilation 
 They will die, they will die, they will die, they will die 
 Never to be seen or heard 
 Now just a memory gone for all eternity 
 Cast into non-existence 
 Given away 
 Life is taken away 
 Festering morbid decay 
 Saturates the air again 
 Stenches of a different pleasure 
 Boiling blood hole deepens 
 Filled with remains, once pitiful lives 
 Slaughtered day by day 
 Die without a face 
 Destroyed without a trace 
 Gathered for the execution 
 Brutal murders one by one begin 
 Dissected for incineration 
 Chosen for annihilation 
 Never to be seen or heard 
 Now just a memory gone for all eternity 
 Burnt into non-existence 
 Given away 
 Life is taken away 
 Morbid decay 
 In vain they have suffered and died"
170,Cannibal Corpse,metal,Hideous Ichor,"Decay, distinct and putrid 
 Moldering remnants compel 
 Fetor, the stench entices me 
 Singular insanity guiding me, driving me 
 Consume the putrefied rot 
 Bodies of the dead 
 Nourish me 
 Madness, obsessive hunger 
 Sickening urges demand 
 Offal, I crave voraciously 
 Cadaver in the cemetery beckoning, summoning 
 Ghastly fumes diffuse retch 
 Flowing from within 
 I must drink 
 Hideous ichor drips from the coffin 
 Inside the corpse has stirred 
 Horrors within my sustenance 
 But is is truly dead? 
 Hideous ichor exudes from the crypt 
 Necrotic but somehow alive 
 The eyes of the dead blankly stare 
 But did it truly die? 
 Siphoning of the blood 
 Plunging my hands in rot 
 Macabre desire, death 
 Macabre desire, death 
 Feeding this ghoulish urge 
 To give me strength this way 
 Macabre desire, death 
 Macabre desire, death 
 Was I hunting it 
 Or was it luring me 
 Macabre desire, death 
 Macabre desire, death 
 Hideous ichor drips from the coffin 
 Inside the corpse has stirred 
 Horrors within my sustenance 
 But is is truly dead? 
 Hideous ichor exudes from the crypt 
 Necrotic but somehow alive 
 The eyes of the dead blankly stare 
 But did it truly die?"
