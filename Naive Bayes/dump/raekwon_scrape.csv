 Verse One: Raekwon the Chef 
 Lay on the crime scene, sippin fine wines 
 Pullin nines on, UFO's, takin' they fly clothe they eyes closed 
 We gettin' loot, no doubt, check the word of mouth, unheard about 
 Guns go off and now a murder bout, I'm out 
 My raps play the part like a Get Smart secret agent 
 In a maze and, styles blazin' 
 Johnny Blaze and Tony Starks in a daze and 
 Rhymin, my nigga Lou Diamond will wrap it up 
 We like Meth to go and fuck with Noodles 
 Havin' them poodles on the lockdown buyin me 
 Amarett-ahs, and chewables, stackin pharmecuetical 
 Rap niggaz on dust and wools 
 Yo, I told you, some kill rob and fold 
 The gold's untold, fuck it it beats parole 
 So stroll marvelous, soul controller 
 Of the whole globe, god damn I got it sewn 
 And yo, whattup pop, pop the suitcase high 
 And we can talk, you can walk out the fuckin' building and get caught 
 Save the fully inflatable, rap relatable, drug relatable 
 Niggaz here to play with you 
 A hundred dollar Rottweiler goes to spot sellers 
 Guns and glocks go to niggaz who got props 
 Off top, jail niggaz get mad bigger 
 And yo, mail a guy about a hundred pictures 
 Word to momma, this rap wonderama team got drama 
 Comma, plus smoke realize marijuana 
 Chef may resign to boat across the Verrazano 
 Immaculate plus all my guns so accurate 
 They get CREAM and the cuisine in Queens 
 I told you, money stated with the night beams and two rings 
 Crazy fat, gettin' ready to do this shit 
 [Ghostface] Sniff mad shit man, what the fuck 
 *Car peels and crashes* 
 Verse Two: Ghostface Killer 
 Who's the Knucklehead, wantin respect? 
 Chop his fingers in the drug game, money well known 
 Lead singer, humdinger, flash is the aftermath 
 Here's his photograph, run up in his lab, take off the mask Chaz and think fast 
 Don't laugh, bag the cash, grab the hash, don't forget his stash 
 Grab the tear gas, and place it in his face fast 
 At full blast 
 ... 
 Then skate to the next gate further upstate 
 I heard they got crazy weight, bagged up by the kegs in 
 Crates like disco breaks, yo look out for Jakes, 
 Give it all it takes, let's burn the place before we motivate 
 Yo Blake, niggaz don't fake, rape his mate 
 If the bitch scream, for God's sake, grab the grey tape 
 It's by the plate, with the blow crushed up with the flakes 
 Killer snakes, four bodies found floatin in lakes 
 Drug related, paper talkin' 'bout the kids who didn't make it 
 Hits without a trace, never seen the Big C Rae and Ghostface 
 Congratulations Chef, let's celebrate and sip an eighth 
 Verse Three: U-God 
 The rap scar is on rap chrome, put it on seal it on 
 We're silicone, Spark it on your Talkathon 
 This rap phenomenon, to word is bond to the arms 
 Hit me on the hip and horns, rap chaperone 
 Scars tone, bar throne, war tones, raw tones 
 Blowin' out the door bones but your rap's fraudulent 
 Plug in these rap quarter inches, reinforced with suspense 
 Be on your rap sword defense, these microphone professional 
 Sensational, fully operational, 
 I got NIGGAZ here to play with you 
 You know the steez you know my whole program, brothers from the No-Lands 
 All we want is the G's, guns and grams 
 Livin' fat like the Hoffa, Mafia, sippin eatin pastas 
 Layin in the house tellin' the seeds about the sagas 
 Before we got Germanic and thoughts got sporadic 
 We grabbed golden tablets and quick guarded the Abbots 
 Slugs hit the belly put tones into the telly 
 Sucker tried to knock me out the box like skelly 
 I smoke the weed dreams I drop top two degrees 
 Honeydips spendin G's on nails and hair weave 
 The crime boss, takin' no loss, excessive force 
 We can play the A-Train, back of the iron horse 
 Yo man, knahmsayin? Fuck it man

 Club nights we snatch linx politic, Africans and chinks 
 While World of Sport niggaz snort coke by the seconds 
 Niggaz projects filled with fiends injectin 
 Morphine, the God seen more CREAM, and upstate 
 Cousin Reek, almost got hit with fourteen 
 Chill Pah, the God'll be a Star when you come home 
 Light bones and let you rock my 3G stone 
 So, see cousin, yo I was workin, cats I'm jerkin 
 And uptown these niggaz actin' like they hurtin' 
 Keys twenty-four a brick 
 Columbians be on some bullshit, that's why Poppy got hit 
 Stay tuned, word up, I hope to see you in June 
 By the way, I seen your bitch, she was up in this cat's room 
 Skeyed up, weed the fuck up, to top it off 
 Look beat up, with two crack fiends huggin your seed up 
 I took care of that, though, but don't worry 'bout it 
 I got your back though

 (Raekwon) 
 Fly like cashmere, last year, my team caught bodies in Gravesmere 
 Hit a store owner named Mike Lavonia 
 Italiano, slanted-eyed bangin' them fat Milano 
 Selling coke right out the bottle 
 Sometime, a nigga brought nines to test with minds 
 Crazy peace, buying keys in Greece 
 Was a rich nigga, picture the nigga without dope figures 
 Condo with his chick, rockin' a gold Vigor 
 Mafia flicks, tyin up tricks was his main hobby 
 Teachin his seed, Wu-Tang karate 
 Mixin drinks in clubs, hairy chest with many minks 
 Night time rollin' with spics 
 Extra live, he claimed he couldn't die, top rank 
 Sixteen shots in his fishtank 
 And his pet piranha, he named him marijuana 
 Smokin' ganja, callin his weed paisandra 
 Claimin New York was ancient Babylon 
 Where the sky stayed the color of grey, like her-on 
 I can't front though, truck loads of indo 
 Soon to blow slow, his ass is out now, tally-hoe 
 {*Pause*}

 Yeah uh huh, uh huh, Miami niggaz 
 Word up, show your love 
 Yeah y'all, yeah y'all, yeah

 Alejandro Sosa: I told you a long time ago, you fucking little monkey, not to fuck me! 
 Tony Montana:Hey, hey who the fuck you think you're talking to huh? You wanna fuck with me? Who the fuck you think I am, your fucking bellboy? Come on, you wanna go to war, we take you to war, okay?' 
 Comin' up on half a mil, we build 
 Get real God, taking you on another one, Son 
 Uh, Julio Iglesias 
 Makin' CREAM like that nigga 
 Verse One: Ghostface Killah 
 Yo, first of all son, peep the arson 
 Many brothers I be sparkin and bustin' mad light inside the dark 
 Call me dough snatcher, just the brother for the rapture 
 I handglide, holdin' on strong, hard to capture 
 Extravagant, RZA bake the track and it's militant 
 Then I react like a convict and start killin' shit 
 It's manifested, the Gods work like appliances 
 Dealin' in my cypher I revolve around science 
 The 9th chamber, leave you trapped inside my hallway 
 You try to flee but you got smoked up by the doorway (blaow! blaow! blaow!) 
 No question, I send your ass back right to the essence 
 Your whole frame is smothered in dirt, now how you restin 
 While I'll be trapped by sounds, locked behind loops 
 Throwin' niggaz off airplanes cause +Cash Rules 
 Everything Around Me+ black, as you can see 
 Swallow this murder one verse like God Degree 
 Then analyze my soundtrack for satisfaction 
 You adapt like a flashback chain reaction 
 Verse Two: Raekwon the Chef 
 Just a minute son... 
 AK's black bust back like seventy Macs 
 I'm all that, street niggaz knowin' my steez black 
 Ron G, you know he coincide with me see 
 Marvelous, Menace fo' Society 
 But anyway, let's toast, champagne thoughts with Ghost 
 I max the most shotguns through the nose 
 Fuck rap, Hip Hop for me off top 
 'Lo wears, and Tommy Hil fly shit with a knot 
 The witty unpredictable live shit, drive by shit 
 Do or die shit, I'll take your life and shit 
 And then you know, I'm runnin' through the penal, foul 
 Four-toothed child was wild 
 The old lady snitched, but fuck it, you know it, one love kid 
 No I'm not doin' a bid 
 Too much to get for what cause six niggaz got 
 Stuck, and the nigga chain was truck 
 Yo fuck that, Criminology rap 
 Speakers stay jet black floatin in the flyest Ac' 
 Nigga... bring it! Yeah... 
 Outro: Raekwon 
 Much love go to New York City 
 All my Tommy Hil' ice rockin' niggaz"
4,Raekwon,hiphop,Incarcerated Scarfaces,"Intro: (LP Version) 
 He looks determined without being ruthless 
 Something heroic in this man, there's a courage about him 
 Doesn't look like a killer 
 Comes across so calm, acts like he has a dream 
 Full of passion 
 You don't trust me, huh? 
 Well you know why 
 I do, we're not supposed to trust anyone in our profession anyway 
 Raekwon the Chef 
 Knock niggaz out the box all the time 
 Bitches on my motherfuckin records Pah 
 Big ones, yeah, big fuckers 
 Straight up, fuck your whole team 
 Yeah bust it 
 Yo, yo, fly G.I. niggaz 
 Now yo yo, whattup yo, time is runnin' out 
 It's for real though, let's connect politic - ditto 
 We could trade places, get lifted in the staircases 
 Word up, peace incarcerated scarfaces 
 Thug related style attract millions Fans 
 They understand my plan, who's the kid up in the green Land? 
 Me and the RZA connect, blow a fuse, you lose 
 Half-ass crews get demolished and bruised 
 Fake be frontin, hourglass heads niggaz be wantin 
 Shuttin down your slot; time for pumpin 
 Poisonous sting which thumps up and act chumps 
 Raise a heavy generator, but yo, guess who's the black Trump? 
 Dough be flowin by the hour's Wu, we got the collars, scholars 
 Word life, peace to power and my whole unit 
 Word up! Quick to set it, don't wet it

 Word up, peace incarcerated scarfaces 
 Chef'll shine like marble, rhyme remarkable 
 Real niggaz raise up, spend your money, argue 
 But this time is for the uninvited 
 Go head and rhyme to it, big nigga mics is gettin' fired 
 Morphine chicks be burnin like chlorine 
 Niggaz recognize from here to Baltimore to Fort Greene 
 But hold up, Moet be tastin like throw-up 
 My mob roll up, dripped to death whips rolled up 
 Ya never had no wins, slidin in these dens wit Timbs 
 Wit Mac-10's and broke friends 
 Ya got guns, got guns too, what up son, do 
 You wanna battle for cash and see who Sun too? 
 I probably wax, tax, smack rap niggaz who fax 
 Niggaz lyrics is wack nigga 
 Can't stand unofficial, wet tissue, blank bustin' Scud missles 
 You rollin' like Trump, you get your meat lumped 
 For real, it's just slang rap democracy 
 Here's the policy, slide off the ring, plus the Wallabees 
 Check the status, soon to see me at Caesar's Palace eatin salads 
 We beatin' mics and the keys to Dallas 
 I move rhymes like retail, make sure shit sell 
 From where we at to my man's cell 
 From staircase to stage, minimun wage 
 But soon to get a article in RapPage 
 But all I need is my house, my gat, my Ac 
 Bank account fat - it's goin' down like that 
 And pardon the French but let me speak Italian 
 Black Stallion, dwellin on Shaolin 
 That means the island of Staten 
 And niggaz carry gats and mad police from Manhattan 
 Now yo yo, whattup yo, time is runnin' out 
 It's for real though, let's connect politic - ditto 
 We could trade places, get lifted in the staircases 
 Word up, peace incarcerated scarfaces 
 I do this for barber shop niggaz in the Plaza 
 Catchin asthma, Rae is stickin gun-flashers 
 Well-dressed, skatin through the projects wit big ones 
 Broke elevators, turn the lights out, stick one 
 Upstairs, switch like a chameleon, Hip Brazilians 
 Pass the cash or leave your children, leave the buildin 
 Niggas, yo they be foldin' like envelopes 
 Under pressure like Lou Farigno on coke 
 Yo, Africans denyin niggaz up in yellow cabs 
 Musty like funk, wavin they arms, the Arabs 
 Sit back, coolin like Kahlua's on rocks 
 On the crack spots, rubberband wrapped on my knots 
 You bitches who fuck dreds on Sudafeds 
 Pussy's hurtin', they did it for a yard for the Feds 
 Word up cousin, nigga, I seen it 
 Like a 27-inch Zenith - believe it

 Of how I'm gonna get mine

 Of how to conquer these rainy days...

 It's going down man, word man 
 Sup black? 
 Niggaz is fuckin' around my gate man 
 Word? 
 Fuck em... yo, I'ma murder somebody man 
 For real I ain't playin' 
 Whatever whatever... 
 Chorus: Blue Raspberry 
 It's raining, he's changing 
 My man is going insane 
 Insane... 
 The war is on, yo 
 Verse One: Ghostface Killer 
 On rainy dayz I sit back and count ways on 
 How to get rich son, show and prove, ask my blitz 
 Stood up late nights, build with my a-lias 
 We can pull a heist, snatch ice or rock mics 
 But this rap shit, got me wanna clack back the latch 
 How it goes Leon, pesos made from scratch 
 But in due time, soon to get mine like Bugsy 
 Heavy on the wrist, Polo mock socks and rugbies 
 Old flicks remind me of Gucci's, pack 'em in your square 
 And little macks milk, blast the year 
 That was Bill Bill, fast forward, ninety-four 
 Who got the bad base? Filthiest fiends scream for more 
 Bless me out of state, howdy Jake's, Starks is back 
 Niggaz want work, now I pull back off a G-Pack 
 Coke rocks, fled to co-ops livin' gossip 
 Them big lip niggaz singin' to cops need to box it 
 Stop it, the projects overflooded with slow leaks 
 The fiends get, new faces get wrapped in sheets 
 I gotta get mine, like my old Earth, bless the cheese blind 
 Sippin on fine wine, the power of the blacks refined 
 (Raining) 
 Devine 
 Waiting on these raw teats takes too long 
 It's like waiting on babies, it makes me want to slay thee 
 But that's ungodly, so yo God, pardon me 
 I need it real quick, the dope flow like penmanship 
 Many heads get pistol-whipped, I blow spots like horse shit 
 So now, talk, shit, nigga, what?? 
 Chorus: Blue Raspberry 
 It's raining, he's changing 
 My man is going insane 
 Insane... 
 Past sunlight, more gunfight 
 Verse Two: Raekwon the Chef 
 ...Time to get the feeling, word up 
 What brings rain hail snow and earthquakes 
 The beat breaks, cause all my niggaz to break son 
 Styles is similar to criminals locked up 
 With gats, ghetto tabernacles is fucked up 
 I live once though the mind stays infinite 
 Travel in the church, nine planets, in my midst 
 While I carry, to earn a decent salary 
 Soon get married, raise a family, but the plan'll be 
 Real great, to sit up in the loft, count stacks and macs 
 And real cats cold watch my back 
 But listen to the Wu son, and maintain it's all real, 
 Starvin individuals kill 
 I puff what's only right, leave the poison alone 
 Projects, infested with rats, cats and crack homes 
 Half of us'll try to make it, the other half'll try to take it 
 So many fake half real freedom-ville 
 Born to science my alliance analyzes 
 Wild surprises, keepin' my eyes wide to this 
 The unfortunate, layin in mountains countin' 
 With jewelry on, can it be the next team house the horn 
 Chill Dunn, just for real ones, light the lye up 
 I hate to have to tie the next guy up 
 Pay attention to Tims ten ways, Wu blends 
 Now I'm starin' you, the true buckle up, now who's a legend? 
 Chorus: Blue Raspberry, Raekwon the Chef 
 It's raining, he's changing 
 Word up Dunn 
 It's raining, he's changing 
 Peace to Philly, VA, these days 
 My man is going insane 
 Word up y'all 
 My man is going insane 
 Word up 
 Insane 
 The sun moon and stars 
 Fly cars, word up y'all 
 No sunlight, more gun fights 
 I've lost him to the street life 
 Street life 
 No cash flow, no more dough 
 He's someone I don't even know 
 Someone I don't know 
 Rainy Dayz... 
 Gettin' through those rainy dayz 
 Gettin' through those rainy dayz 
 Gettin' through those rainy dayz 
 Gettin' through those rainy dayz 
 I lost him to the street life

 Poisonous, poisonous (word word word) 
 I should slap all y'all niggaz for comin' in my fuckin' face with that shit 
 All right cool yeah, go ahead man... 
 Poisonous 
 Verse One: Inspectah Deck a.k.a. Rebel INS 
 Poisonous paragraphs, smash ya phonograph 
 In half, it be the Inspectah Deck on the warpath 
 First class leavin' mics with a cast 
 Causin ruckus like the aftermath when guns blast 
 Run fast, here comes the verbal assaulter 
 Rhymes runnin' wild like a child in a walker 
 I scored from the inner slums abroad 
 And my thoughts are razor sharp I sliced the mic from the cord 
 First they criticize, but now they have become 
 Mentally paralyzed with hits that I devise 
 Now I testify, the rest is I, Rebel INS 
 Ya highness, blessed to electrify 
 With voltage of an eel, truth that I reveal'll 
 Crush the amateurs who screamed to keep it real 
 Caesar black down hoodied up and fatigues 
 Part time minor leagues receive third degrees 
 Attack like a wolf pack, once I pull back 
 The God-U, and bust through like a fullback 
 Verse Two: Ghostface Killah a.k.a. Tony Starks 
 Yo, you fourteen carat gold slum computer wizard 
 Tappin inside my rap vein causes blizzards 
 Do I like the kills for ice trife like botta digits 
 Gorillas injected with strength of eighty midgets 
 The Earth spins ruins, rap exotic blends 
 Let my peeps in, niggaz gaspin swallowin aspirins 
 What a dosage, you overdosed in rap 
 High explosives my post-its hypnotize with hypnosis 
 I sell goods, my whole Clan is on the run like Natural Born Killers 
 Record-breaking the album Thriller 
 Now access the jig who has bombs and rocket launchers 
 Float like dope killer bees is what I sponsor 
 Ya entrepreneur, pens and gear like shakespeare 
 When I fuck I grab hair, collect drawers as souveneirs 
 Fuck yeah, my crew down German beers 
 My career is based on guns, throwin' cats in wheelchairs 
 Etcetera, damage any lame ass competitor 
 Who try to front, get broken and passed like leathers 
 Whatever hot hardheads get shattered like mirrors 
 Beretta shots splatter your goose, scatter ya feathers 
 Say never poetry chumps crumbs deal with graphic 
 Blew my family overseas in mansions 
 If rap was crack, fully packed I be tour cats 
 Tax the kingpin of the rap drug traffickin' 
 Village niggaz get slapped in Manhattan 
 For rappin', big Ghost steps off laffin 
 (Were you just using the Wu-Tang school method against me? 
 I've learned so many styles, forgive me) 
 Verse Three: Raekwon the Chef a.k.a. Lou Diamonds 
 Sit back relax, fake niggaz don't get turns 
 Watch me massage ya brain with slang that's king 
 Projects filled with young men cause threats 
 Who is that? Thousand dollar chains and techs 
 Focus, the brokest niggaz of life shit 
 These mics is like cocaine Sun, check the suicidal hype shit 
 Exchange mad blunts taste the sweepstakes 
 Keepin' up on fakes outta state for cakes 
 No doubt, plus nobody amount, we making dough off of 
 Puttin' fifty on the Land and Allah, it's like that 
 Pull ya shoes up black, matta of fact just adapt 
 Tie up, ya black Nike's and tight hats 
 Corners, stay surrounded with foreigners, whattup dread? 
 Feds caught you grudgin for his bread 
 But regardless, peace to jail niggaz with charges 
 Unify layin in the guard with La 
 My Clan done ran from Japan to Atlanta, with stamina 
 Clingers and gamblers, and gram handlers 
 Tical like the Isle, so God, let's get steamed 
 Infrared guard yo' Beem, 
 So seek nuff respect Rude bwoy you bet, 
 Keep it movin par shallah Pro black like tar 
 Designin the fly shit and stay shinin and 
 The RZA pours more beats than Cristal's fine wine 
 Concrete raps go to black 
 With 50 other niggaz on the other side of the map 
 Knew it's all good and all done what, we want some 
 Mike Tyson of this rap shit, pullin out Macs for fun 
 Verse Four: The Genius/GZA a.k.a. Maximillion 
 The nigga don't get mad, I got mad styles of my own 
 And it's shown when my hands grip the chrome microphone 
 Verbally I catch bodies with cordless shotties 
 Intriguin emcees, I keep 'em trained like potties 
 I bomb facts, my sword is an axe 
 To split backs invisible, like dope fiend tracks 
 Sky's the limit, niggaz are timid, and nobody knows 
 How we move like wolfs in sheep clothes 
 Producin data, microchips or software 
 Undaground and off air, the Land of the Lost 
 Notorious henchman from the North 
 Strikin niggaz where the Mason-Dixon line crossed"

 Verse One: Ghostface Killer 
 Yo, check what happened out of state 
 I'm knocking off a half-a-cake Cash Rule, flying at a fast rate 
 I smoke the black dust kept my hands clutched, I'm fallin' in lust 
 Spore plush I played my hand like a royal flush 
 Baggy jeans, Wallabee Clarks, pretty woman 
 I put it in him, shot up in him, deadly venom 
 I hung around the big time bosses 
 Illegal force exchange thoughts, showing love to all my sources 
 Spades tried to bag me, like Cagney, and Lacey 
 Chef had that bitch Stacey slippin in Macy's 
 I dose off, catch a flashback on how I got trapped 
 And got licked like Papsy in a mob flick I got hit 
 Stumblin holdin' my neck to the God's rest 
 Opened flesh burgundy blood colored my Guess 
 Emergency trauma, black teen headed for surgery 
 Can it be an out of state nigga tried to murder me? 
 I should've stayed in Job Corp, but now I'm a outlaw 
 Ray Cartegna, carry a fo'-fo' nigga 
 {Can it be that it was all so simple then?}

 Back in days, crime pays in mad ways 
 Sportin Tommy Hil with caves 360 waves 
 And no searchin for loose ends, now flex 300 Benz 
 Mad 10's with mad diamonds 
 Now that's the life of the good life, sometimes niggaz act trife 
 I paid the price throughout my hood life 
 Remember I got blasted, now that's in the past kid 
 God forbid I lay in the casket 
 But now I'm all about G-notes, no time for weed, mixed with coke 
 I wash my mouth out with soap 
 And I got my act together, 'Lo sweaters and better 
 And fat leather, so whatever, bring it on

 Stay dipped, don't have no money in your pocket 
 In the streets while these people mark money in their Jeep 
 Crack bums watch your back for jumps 
 Caught before a fake twenty dollar bill, get 'em son, we ain't the one 
 Politickin, purse vickin, sick of these Dominicans 
 Eating good, had to shoot my way up out of Bennigans

 Verse Two: Master Killer 
 Proceed with caution as you enter the symphony 
 Degrees of pulse will increase intensely 
 Syndrome was caused by the deadly drums 
 But the battle was won by swords being swung 
 Slicing with a vocal 
 From the international vocalist 
 Ya style is too local 
 To fuck with this 
 All fits of antagonists 
 No assistance movin motionless 
 Mysterious swiftness 
 Thoughts roll down the shaft of the brain 
 Mental gives the signal to the physical 
 Whirlwind kicks and hits from every angle 
 Violent temperments 
 Uncountenance dented 
 Poison vintage wine rhymes I invented 
 Chumped by the drunken punches that punches the heart 
 Vital sparks from the arteries start 
 Verse Three: Ghostface Killer 
 The treasure is the glaciers of ice original man 
 Posess the power of hold G's guns and grams 
 Straight up and down it's all good 
 Peace to them check castin chain snatchin gun flashin

 Analyze stocks, we'll be buyin lion heads and cloths 
 To all my house bitches, Starks will be home soon 
 I'm on tour chill, catch you Ninety-Six in June 
 But until then my ten-man team be safe 
 Chill on the whips to settle this, we can all get laced 
 Take a boat cruise, sip daquiris and max swimmin pools 
 Fly jewels Wally shoes blow stacks relax kid 
 Black kids got a cravin for grapes until we get back 
 I'm packed leave the Mac that you're with 
 But whatever, I gotta hit other sides of the Earth 
 Spread Wu-ness, foolish, civilization's cursed 
 But luckily I'm born to be wild and aure-al 
 Move crowds collect twenty thou and then we out 
 Heavy convoys my crew keep pretty boys paranoid 
 Blow like a steroid pat Dan's they're Akyroid 
 My seeds growin' his seeds marry his seeds 
 That's how we keep Wu-Tang money all up in the family

 Verse One: Nas 
 Through tha lights, cam'ras, n action, glama glittas in gold. 
 I unfold, tha scroll. Plant seeds ta stampede tha globe. 
 When I'm deceased, by then tha beasta rise like yeast 
 Ta conquer peace, leavin' savages ta roam in tha streets. 
 Live on tha run; police payin' me ta give in my gun. 
 Trick my wisdom, wit tha system that imprisoned my son. 
 Smoke a gold leaf. I hold heat, nonchalantly. 
 I'm raunchy, but things I do is real. It never haunts me, 
 While, funny style niggaz roll in tha pile. 
 Roosta heads profile on a bus ta Riker's Isle, 
 Holdin' weed inside they pussy wit they minds 
 On tha pretty things in life. Props is a true thugs wife. 
 It's like a cycle; niggaz come home, some'll go in, 
 Do a bullet, come back, do tha same shit again. 
 From tha womb to tha tomb, presume tha unpredictable. 
 Guns salute life, rapidly, that's tha ritual. 
 Verse Two: Raekwon the Chef 
 Perhaps bullets bust niggaz discuss mad money 
 True lies and white guys, we can see it through the eyes 
 Catch the most on tape, kilos disintegrate 
 Pyrex pots, we break, fiends lickin' plates 
 In the building niggaz building, like little children starin' 
 Them older niggaz ain't carin 
 Sirens circlin fiends are lurkin in your baggage 
 Oh, one's gone now, what, smack him in his cabbage 
 In the woodwork, crack cells bubble like Woolworth's 
 In the projects, richest niggaz rockin' all the real worth 
 Police questioning, rooftop cats invested in 
 Tradin in they Lexus' GS's sendin messages 
 Two and two makes four, Cristal's crazily pour 
 Gun wars my crew phantom like swords 
 Verse Three: Ghostface Killer 
 With the green leathers, hunded pound snakes and cakes 
 Fiends found in lakes, jeolously Jakes we shake 
 What I strive for is what I live for 
 Infatuated by material things, and it's wild like for war 
 Like somewhere over the rainbow, I see a big pot of gold 
 Future stacks yo I hold 
 Thousands of cracks bagged up inside the shoebox 
 Don't keep jack in my lap, don't wanna see Tupac 
 Got two spots, a new lot, flooded with rocks 
 Shoot-outs making me hot, crooked cops Bad Tony and the ball drop 
 In the Now, I'm bangin' niggaz for slide time 
 Hurry up Duke I'm next, show 'em mine 
 And what the fuck is you looking at? 
 By the way young blood, hit me off with that Green Bay hat 
 Watch your back inside the hall, new niggaz slide through 
 Like doors yo, you're starin' in the mess hall 
 Your adrenaline runs, cigarette niggas be swindlin 
 New jacks surrenderin, come home not rememberin 
 Made bail with different size kicks on, a white dress shirt 
 Lookin' gay in the yard, and you got hurt 
 Flashbacks, of the day room, mop ringer style 
 Your faggot ass got bashed tryin' to turn the dial 
 You told your boo you was whylin 
 Once you heard Wu, out of the blue, your family's from Shaolin 
 High class cooks, throw on vestes out of phone books 
 Infirmary niggas are screaming, ""I got drugs!"" 
 Sharpen toothbrushes 190 mixed with baby oil and shit 
 Your man's in the kitchen stashing ice picks 
 Well I'ma end this with a big red cherry on top

 Fake niggaz who tried to flex hard came and went 
 They couldn't match up with the fly nigga 
 Wit his back against the wall 
 Heads clapped once I came in the door 
 I played the speaker, sippin on Kahlua 
 Saw this bad bitch wit a switch 
 And yo, I had to step to her in a manner 
 And rather wished the current was warm 
 When I had reached her, I looked and knew the shit was on 
 Peace, excuse me, allow to introduce myself 
 Yo, I'm the man, and Honey, you've been rated top shelf 
 Yo, what's your name hon, hair wrapped up in a bun 
 Your eyes sparkle, just like glass in the sun 
 Never diss em, it's hard for a nigga just to miss em 
 Especially, when you're browsin, goin' fishin 
 Your wasteline, bangin' like a bassline 
 Physical form is well complexed 
 And yo, I love your outline, Boo 
 Your whole body is wild, wit your rugged profile 
 Enough to make a hard rock smile 
 You can't strikeout, tell me what can really go wrong 
 You rockin' labels - Tommy Hil down to Claiborne 
 Show me some love hon, show me some love boo 
 Show me the vibe and I'll be more than glad to shoot it through 
 Aiyyo peep it, I know you love Victoria's Secret 
 And lovin' all the marvelous slang on how I freak it 
 Plus, see you're the type to make a nigga crash 
 Far from trash, your flesh is way softer than a baby's ass 
 Your body lotion is the potion, the shit got me open like dust 
 And yo, your stee is high potent, yo 
 We can go the distance, I put you under wings 
 From this convo we can spark and see whatever brings 
 I walked a hot Arabian desert, barefooted 
 I grabbed your hand, you grabbed my joint and knew where to put it 
 Word up, yo, straight up and down yo

 We gon' get dat cruchy chump for all of his lump 
 Don't try to front, you was sweatin this Hilfidiger 
 Guess who walked in - Abbott and his man from Farragut 
 Confront him wit the Ruger on his back, walk in black 
 Where's your man, where's the sky blue Land at? 
 Stop playin' Wu in the back, smacked him wit the gat 
 (Yo, money said he be here in fifteen!) 
 Stop lyin', wait for the Millennia green to pull up 
 He got the Donna Karen shit on, two rings 
 Six carats a piece plus the chain swing 
 Like anchors on ships flooded wit all diamond chips 
 Back pockets: two clips - four-fifths wit rubber grips 
 Layin, two bottles of brass I was slayin 
 Meditatin, red dot be waitin for my payment 
 Heard the key in the lock, cocked the glock 
 Turn the lights out, dip behind the couch 
 Kion, gag his mouth 
 Infra-redded his head when he entered 
 But a soft Perry Ellis leather with Dorinda 
 A friend of, Kion's wife, Kenya, the bitch larger than life 
 Yo, shorty be fuckin' mad Columbian niggaz 
 Fuck it, get on the floor meet the black Lex Luthor 
 Stripped fast, the bitch had on Claiborne drawers 
 Yo Rae, you about to scrape her, chill Ghost

 Wanted dead or alive, bounty on the poster 
 Wild in the West, a student of my culture

 Solid gold crown is shinin 
 Solid gold, check it Sun yo 
 Solid gold crown be shinin and blindin like some diamonds 
 I be pioneering the style in the cloud with silver linings 
 Double breasted, bullet proof vested, well protected 
 The heart the rib cage the chest and solar plexus 
 Casting stones, cracking two-hundred and six bones 
 And watch yo' ass get blown to a sea of fire and brimstone 
 How dare you approach it with dim pones 
 The overfiend like noah bean green souls with a soldier mean 
 The grand exquisite imperial wizard oh is it 
 The Ryzarector come to pay your ass a visit 
 Local bio-chemical, universal giant, the black general 
 Lickin' shots to Davy Crockett on the bicentennial 
 Happen millennium two thousand microchips two shots of penicillin 
 Goes up your adrenalin son it's time for boutin 
 It's a mileage resemblin niggaz who like followin 
 Trapped inside your projects like a genie inside the bottle 
 Verse Four: Master Killer 
 God steppin forth upon holy down of the track 
 It's the sound that surrounds and hurts me like I'm under attack 
 So I decided to bite down on the mic 
 So the pain of the track won't deny the fact 
 That I'm the Master, for what lurks, is an expert 
 That hurts the individual who tries to visualize under 
 'Cause I strike, like thunder 
 Niggaz couldn't stand my heat, it's unbearable 
 My wisdom fucks up your respiratorial 
 Systems are fractured by the killa tactics 
 Style is ragged and thoughts are mad jagged 
 Enter the entity, my vicinity 
 Is three hundred and sixty degrees of humidity 
 Represent the school of hard knocks and glocks my 
 Clan is hoss and got mad moss for blocks so 
 Feel the force of impact from the iron side of 
 The gat as I attack the track 
 From the blind side of the pack, Starks pass the chrome 
 Watch a nigga get blown out his muthafuckin dome 
 Piece, deceased, laid to rest 
 Verse Five: Ghostface Killer, a.k.a. Tony Starks 
 Yo, aiyyo I got to serve them my way, move give me room 
 Holdin' up your saloon, clean sweep, like a broom 
 Full moons make me howl like a wolf outta breath 
 Sold only new vocal cords I heard Genius on Gef 
 So step back, to the lab at, high velocity 
 My teammate, enhance cells well like a pharmacy 
 Fuck horado pablos plan growas bravo 
 Goodfellas we know, best sellas become novels 
 The man rockin' head bands, silk scarves and jams 
 Early 80's british rock, playboys, mocks, and shams 
 The laser beam vocalist does well at symphonies 
 Bad days, watch me snatch ice right outta Tiffany's 
 Remember them kids that came off with 8 million 
 Robbed the Brinks and I labelled in royal pavillions 
 Them flower heads must have been stupid 
 Tell me how the fuck black niggaz get caught wit all that loot kid 
 That's jet money, undaground money 
 Submarines and rings too bad you fucked up dummies 
 Cosa cosa, come on..."

 Get in touch with that West coast Cali crab you stabbed 
 And meet me at the bitch lab 
 So word up kid, we slid like a fat four to twelve bid and shit 
 Couldn't even rest, I need the vic 
 And when I slept, I dream G's, Son I need some 
 Keys roll self, call up Son

 A fake nigga faked and they killed his click 
 Gimme a minute and I'm with it 
 Yo niggaz done did it 
 Rock your vest 
 Keep your whip tinted 
 So now we see him up in BoJangles 
 Stranglin a forty ounce, with ten G's worth of gold bangles 
 Diamonds, what, all up in his face 
 With his man's mace, medallions the size of dinner plates 
 Yo, he knew we knew him so we blew him 
 Took thirty G's worth of jewels of that nigga 
 Do him! 
 So now I'm lampin in my man's Land

 A little weed-hopper running around here man 
 Look at you baby, you look good 
 (We've got the powers to resurrect the dead) 
 Understand, I watched you go through a lot of trials and tribulations 
 But you know something, like I used to always tell you baby 
 A good listener's a good learner 
 (G-O-D's my reality) 
 I see you listened VERY well, understand? 
 (I'm elevating strong and I'm gonna go on to the highest degree) 
 Your time is coming baby 
 See sometime, it could be like, a rear view 
 YouknowhatI'msayin? And people don't know when their blessing comes

 Man, I watched you when I used to sit down and you would 
 Trick me out my money shootin dice, niggaz is you crazy? 
 Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

 Crazy you crazy man 
 Yo Rae, you remember that shit man? 
 When we used to be down there in the hills and shit man?

 And you'd catch it, from Old Man Freed 
 He'd be yelling ""You little slick ass"" 
 Ha ha ha ha 
 Talk to me baby, knowhatI'msayin? 
 Ha ha ha ha 
 I've been through all them things, man I'm watchin you growin' 
 But remember one thing Rae like I used to tell you 
 The child you was is making you the man you is today 
 And if you don't know where you came from baby 
 You DAMN sure know that you don't know where you going 
 Can you see what I'm saying? 
 Know which way you travelling 
 (We've got the powers to resurrect the dead) 
 You understand? And follow that destiny, follow the light 
 And it'll set you free

 You my main man

 Now that could be the Wu-Tang production 
 Start to knuckle up and, gun shots start to click the block's ducking 
 Could it be, and would it be, that we was babies 
 Catching rabies, niggaz seem to act crazy 
 Day one, in my spot July the 10th 
 I had a mint, stickin up Devines hittin them with nines 
 I was toxie, from layin up in Roxie's all night 
 This nigga bust a shot, lick my man's wife 
 It was havoc I contact the Abbot 
 He shook the shoulder though, then he passed the phat chrome automatic 
 We goin' to war, you know we headed to the floor 
 He woulda did it for me, fuck it, let's mosie 
 Schemin dough, with the P.L.O., wrapped on tight 
 Sayin' in my mic ""Yo we gotta go"" 
 My first impression was to add some lessons 
 Question, one, what made you even show your gun and blow the session? 
 He replied and rocked the green eye 
 And yo, he started, yelling ""Them niggaz sellin two for fives!"" 
 But he's a goner and I got my corner 
 What, I'm feeding my babies, Cash Rules for mortal daughters 
 Yeah, Rae baby 
 Feeding my babies, Cash Rules for mortal daughters 
 Only God is the son of man 
 (We've got the powers to ressurrect the dead) 
 I'll say it one time, and be ceratin that fake God does not exist 
 (Oh, G-O-D's my reality) 
 (I'm elevating strong we're gonna go on to the highest degree) 
 This is why the universe, has itself balanced the scale 
 Of devine knowledge, and it was measured by the portion 
 Of solid knowledge 
 No man, can judge for another 
 But each man must weigh all facts and circumstances 
 And find truth in his own judgement of righteousness 
 See, the way to evil, balance equality in no man 
 For no man is good and bad at the same time 
 Either you good, or you bad"

 February tenth day on a Wednesday 
 It's like grimsday 
 Russian hats rocking it the Benz way 
 That day we got guns on us 
 Jakes want us, 
 Playin' Einstein lenses and Auroras 
 Little meek caught us 
 Couple of francs, peep the blue Taurus 
 What up tuck your chain they came for us 
 Jumped out big nines and some hard bottles 
 Eyes of hate finally meeting up wid the stakes 
 It was who I thought it was 
 2 pair of Clarks one pair of Lugz 
 Wit the hardbottom nigga wid the snub 
 Cocked it, where rock at, stop that 
 Violate this cipher pa we'll definitely strike back 
 All of us right there slight fear in our heart 
 Blink we take it right there 
 Doing our thing apart 
 Broad jumped out tryin' to run shit 
 Spoken loud words all we want is his head 
 He did some dumb shit 
 Beef from Miami now 
 Damn yo big head Lance in some wild shit 
 Noodles caught the stair down 
 Now it came back to me yo 
 Handle it wise and brutally yo 
 Put down your tooly and talk like men 
 No shots rang yo, hittin' the ground like mangoes 
 Swiss cheese the thirty-G dorango 
 Few weeks later son seem 'em all...

 Don't make me throw no gun in your mouth 
 You know? 
 How long is your CREAM? This long? 
 Eh yo, his belt got karats in it 
 Swift description, E-320 nigga pitchin 
 Rock a raw dinosaur chain, hang to his thing 
 It's like, he pump isolated, still cashin in CREAM 
 Niggas in the hood hate him, drew a vase of him 
 Blaze 'em, he actin' like Shallah raisin him 
 This is hydrogen, son ain't live as him 
 He like Maguyver, chin 4 spies with him 
 Roll relentless, desert that he hold is a gift wish 
 Shash the list, give his miss dick 
 Technique, operation: tech scream 
 Bet CREAM, them alligators jet like a vet swing 
 Nigga like Nicolas Cage with the gauge in your braids 
 2 cannons that'll spray, rockin' banana suede 
 Suck this drunk alcohol dick 
 Fuck y'all niggas with hits 
 We bout to shit on y'all shit

 Y'all brothas wanna call us out? 
 Name names, otherwise it'd be the best to shut the fuck up 
 Get pimp-smacked up, jacked up and macked up 
 You're scared and froze of bein exposed 
 I own Harlem, I bone Harlem, call me the mayor 
 It's my borough, you don't want no problems 
 I'm on now, you dead pop, all jokes aside 
 I ride the top, you glide the bottom 
 Pitfall, 5 foot 9, my dick, balls 
 Shit y'all, leave flat line to stick your's 
 We flip off basic and brace it 
 8 kills, 47 ways to taste it 
 Never understand what you never been told 
 You did your book bitin off of my scrolls 
 We hit man, Colombo, coats and hats to match 
 Bust off quick, and then, guns go back 
 (Superb) 
 I move like Arthur Ash against God 
 4 raquets, 8 balls and no practice 
 Every cypher's a heated discussion 
 The industry was like a beat that needed precussion 
 I brun the music, shit that make crews flip 
 State that I'm the illest, this is Q.U. shit 
 I used to heat-hole, now I'm takin' over like the repo' 
 Bitches that roll, Cee-Lo that'll sniff a kilo' 
 We went from Frank's and greens to shanks and beans 
 Now we drive our Navigators to banks in Queen's 
 Y'all can't fuck around, your words ain't right 
 Every time I touch the mic, they say ""Perb ain't right"" 
 But that's the truth though, d'oh, infact that's it 
 When they drop this shit, I'm gon' cop that shit 
 The new star, you want me? I'm at the juice bar 
 Y'all once hap' niggas, give me 2 stars

 I heard what y'all rappin' about, but bring your stash out 
 You shouldn't throw rocks if you livin' in glass house 
 Sneak your weak shit at us, on the low though 
 Where these cats come from, speakin' about po' 
 He got cash to cop and I'm crashin {*car crashing*} 
 But half of y'all cats just catchin up to Rae' last year 
 Got guns in the jungle, call 'em Jurassic 
 The chrome, the steel, the 20-shot plastic 
 While y'all niggas cop jars, me and my niggas cop bars 
 Gettin' head from rock stars 
 We blowin' everything apart, I'm smashin the charts 
 How I see it? (Yo, how you see it?) 
 Chorus: Raekwon 
 Eh yo, what you wanna be when you grow up? 
 Yo, I wanna be a leader 
 Slow your speed up and stop tryin' to be us 
 Say somethin' always, got a future? Stay out the hallways 
 And get yourself right, a 100 more ways 
 (Rhyme Recca) 
 Fly like iceberg, nice with verbs, precise words 
 Bently swerve, hit the curb, jump out, cock back, spit out 
 Shut your block down, get out, criminal route 
 Gangsta shit, can't talk now, gun in your mouth 
 Cream Team killas, cacoon cats like caterpillars 
 Giant size gorillas, break niggas backs from the skrilla 
 Scratch, greenback track, Fed's berserk 
 That's my word, disrespect Recca, get what you deserve 
 Inferno, melt down mic's, millionaire in my afterlife 
 Broke bread with Christ on the last night 
 Apocalypse, sleep with 4-5th, 2 clips 
 Passport, cellphone with the removable micro-chip

 Matching bracelet, Cream Team crisp the basic"

 The greatest thing a kid could have 
 To chill with his family, sit back layin on his Dad 
 Props go out, next thing you know Pops roll out 
 Moms cussed him out, get the fuck out 
 Couldn't understand it, feelings turnin' to hard granite 
 Now she a one single parent 
 Growin' up on welfare, she might need healthcare 
 That made me feel no one else cares 
 Moms is a part of my life forever 
 Gettin' drunk that's her business guess that's stormy weather 
 Fish and grits, twelve o' clock midnight pissed 
 Stop cryin Ma take a kiss 
 Take care of ya brother and sis 
 Something happen to me I miss ya better be offic (official) 
 She meant that shit, every mouthful accurate 
 Took me to school be emaculate 
 Taught by the best, remember stress 
 A ghetto agenda that's how we rest 
 Don't let'em play with your emotions 
 Lotioning me, little money in my vest 
 Damn, Mom going through it 
 Still holding me through it 
 Sneaker money fucked up 
 Yo, Yeah when Granddaddy died 
 I know you didn't see me cry 
 Held it in, it hurted Ma alot 
 Remember, Bucs had me in a tux 
 Went to beef stake Charlie's had my first pay cut 
 Yeah, lovin' you always screamin on janitors in hallways 
 It's my son always 
 Caught me in the crib yo, smokin' 
 Sat me down heart broken, hopin the phase had me open yo 
 You like, hey yo, for real you like lovin' you for life it's only right 
 Strong yourself we make it 
 Weak minded you naked 
 The pain and hurt I can't take it 
 Plus my Uncle in jail 
 That's your brother go see him, he look forward to it like mail 
 You my ace, you the lady in the place 
 You ain't a waste, we just trapped inside a low-life place

 And who bit off the last nigga tape stole his state 
 Wake up we running outta plans 
 The devil inside of him 
 Tricknology is in one hand 
 Future's so far to see 
 The present's how will it be 
 The past don't even ask just believe 
 Looking in the dictionary 
 Trying to spell out hard words 
 Define 'em and design 'em 
 I shine and curve 
 Take this jewel in and conquer me 
 I blend it in wit ganja 
 Not for the babies it's a mind sponsor 
 From the 17 million God raised 
 2 million lost slaved 
 19 million may we all praise

 Rockin' rentals, spittin' phlegm out 
 Sucked his teeth, two fingers pointin down

 CEO of Benny-Hanna, He fucked, sent her to Ghana 
 He's Benz nigga, rocked shorts, beige Tims nigga he real 
 Took us to Switzerland, dressed us all ill 
 Smoking ganja, rocked Anacondas, on next border Elantra 
 Sent it to his mama 
 Now that's a major move, the nigga love family 
 Wouldn't hand me no drugs, showed me his jammi 
 Bulldog Stanley 
 Flexin on kinal, sit down, do it Chinese style 
 On graduation day he threw me a towel 
 He came through, heavy like fuck, suit flammable 
 Ill pair of gators he copped in Beirut 
 Had his man wit him, just stare, don't stand wit him 
 If assassination strike, he gotta make plans wit him 
 Roll a joint, keep him on point ?Don Troing poing coin? 
 Freaked it, members like that I wanna join 
 The next day I heard he got knocked, fucked me all up 
 We felt it on the block, let the seeds rock 
 Peep what the nigga got rocked for

 When we caught him the only famous nigga 
 Was a lord in his forum 
 Bum nigga fresh outta jail

 Till he got large son bought a whale 
 As you're by the entrance 
 Guess it's real nigga night out 
 He moving on his own negligence 
 Yo Lexxy strap up meet you in the back 
 In the Acura spectacular big key stackeler

 Standing by the incinerator

 Spit nozzles on the tools 
 Might just bust him quiet style rules

 Blood got a salty taste

 Laced now it's a case 
 Threw up vomit on my Kobe 
 Snatched all his ice now 
 Chrome teeth boating of a loan key 
 Didn't know the kid was large 
 Hour later call from jail

 Chill you bigga than the ocean 
 Slow motion play it off no emotion 
 But my man in there grossing 
 What to do they might kill him 
 We might kill you circulate death 
 That's how the real do 
 We sat there 3 live macks of the year 
 Crack beers one nigga in the back 
 Washing off his trackers

 Dress nasty like fuck, keep my bird on the job yo

 Took care of that, shared, even shed a tear for that 
 Bust my gat to throw gear on her back 
 Damn son, why she takin' you through that? 
 She's a part of me, pardon me flow Allah, we sworn we 
 Wisin up, take care of home bases 
 Then we slide to another part and start more hatred

 Ready to haunt something, takes something of yours

 Watchin how the big niggas rollin' wit big cream, big schemes 
 Quick to flash ya gat, laser beam 
 Pool table action black, hundred stacks made my niggas leave 
 Some be sayin' ""Let 'em breathe"" 
 The others wanna deceive, how we gonna make it if we don't achieve? 
 Right now, catch it from a vertical degree yo 
 We startin showin our asses, committing burgularies 
 One got caught, threw us all off 
 Threw us in the hell section near the boardwalk 
 Wonderin how the sword talk 
 Did he fall off? Did he stand like the hawk that he was in New York? 
 Kept the waves spinnin on the cross, of course 
 Come back a little cutty endorse 
 Risked it for his kids the pain is lost 
 We sittin' back on a better note

 (Raekwon) 
 Pit bull fights, niggaz is bustin' the lights 
 Undercovers gettin' killed for drugs - yo 
 Fiends is basin, runners is licensed to fight 
 Young gangstas chase sneakers and snubs - and yo 
 Elevator's broken, pissy stairwells and shells 
 Old men gossip with tales, you know? 
 Police burners with bodies on 'em, bury 'em 
 Worry for minutes then we fire them (blaow!) 
 I see firemen, ambulances, narcotic mansions 
 So melodic, rock chronic, pop tonic scramblin 
 See all these niggaz into gamblin - yo 
 Just give me square feet, uniquely I'm handlin niggaz 
 Done danced with niggaz, plus yo, threw niggaz in vans 
 Left him on trains, his veins got ham in 'em 
 Take a message, he ran, it was a quarter to four plan 
 He had me on the floor with my man 
 We both drugged out, scholars with grams 
 Tri-colored rocks, follow the hands, full sorrow in plans 
 Make one false move you blam 
 Eh yo take the globe right out of ya land 
 We broke out in Iran. 
 (Chorus: Polite) 
 Eh yo it's eight million stories in the city 
 Niggas actin' shifty, Ice Water back on the grizzly 
 Brand new handgun that hold about fifty 
 It's a new boss in town like Mauseberg Mickey 
 Eight million stories and six is from the hood 
 A real live hustler up to no good 
 They needed more yae-yo to ease they habit 
 They said we fell off, the streets don't believe you faggots! 
 (Raekwon) 
 Where all the wolves live, sub-machine guns and big beamers 
 Yo circle the crib, you see teamsters that try you again 
 Little niggas is blind, the nines fly out and slap a few men 
 That's mine, let up off 'em again 
 Take seventy more shots, the remedy, Wu through the fence 
 This bench God, lays in gents 
 Eh yo pop the head off right under the tents 
 This is more current events, pay attenti 
 The legend is here, as long as you know him he coffins ya men 
 What? Bulletproof pimps, big hammers, multiple flips 
 As long as it's bread, you know you was hit 
 Eh yo let that stack get rinsed 
 Play the back, sharp as a fuck, ownin' my own shit 
 Grown niggas get moments to vent 
 Give 'em the real Lex Diamond Story, welcome 'em in"

 Stuck, y'all like gum underneath my kicks 
 Better move little fucks when the heat I'll spit 
 The hammer clap like the ass on a meat-out chick 
 Dump clips like a trifflin' ass bitch to drop 
 If you short you're a chance in the box 
 But I ain't lettin' you play with the guns in the club, I'm boothin' the ox 
 Got my eyes on the ho's and I'm a peripheral 
 Got you cowards poppin' that Moe', my hand on the 'istol 
 Wild out, have a ball, you could drink till you 'url 
 Thought the Firewater was strong, the pound'll leave you curled 
 On the floor, like a new born baby, God 
 What you mean ""Is he dead?"", what type of shit is leakin' out of his head? 
 When you cowards see the drama and it come to a head 
 I'm hittin' Rae up on the jacket, it ain't much to be said 
 If it's on, go without sayin' somethin', deliverin' 
 Visa verca, this is Havoc, baby, we those niggas (we those niggas)

 Eh yo all that money, all them niggas 
 All them shorties, everybody yell ""All lovely""

 I chop meat out ya face, Daddy, gladly 
 Mad breeze on, rubberband currency and I splash ya visa 
 You know the code, yo caesar low straddlers 
 Front Streets, cracks all in the front seat spazzin' 
 Imperial wizards, Staten 
 Knife game off the chain and I'm with four hundred with wagons yo 
 Live wires, shoot darts for bread 
 Any map, I assist that, I'm holdin' it, all niggas dead 
 What? Battle for cake and fuck wizzes 
 We do it straight business, all mount ride, ain't no fake niggas 
 Reminisce, spit faces 
 Pissin' on the fake little swindler's list, Rae gave them niggas cake 
 Battle the gun, you're wildin' 
 I might levitatate well, I might take ya shit, push up, stylin' it 
 Oxes, reefers, police need us 
 The regime of Shaolin with Queens re-up 
 Fuckin' with the poisonous hand 
 Remember y'all, no commercial, I hurt you, yo go get ya man's 
 (Raekwon) 
 Eh yo select me, Gucci sneaker recipe 
 Not the S dot Carters, no disrespect but respect me 
 One of the top five gangstas alive 
 My element is just the Elliott Ness, niggas who hide 
 Yo I ran from some niggas that was police 
 These niggas heard about me bringin' marked money in, I had the whole East 
 I've been the greatest, been flippin' the latest 
 Somethin' like the new haggler on the Ave., ham it up, pullin' haze 
 And all the young niggas praise me 
 It's like the talent of the Six Million Dollar Man, 'yana pace 
 Come on, banana squeeze, aim at these Caravans 
 Heard he had his man and that ugly Keish' 
 Comin' from a galaxy of hood, hard real people gettin' ki's

 Excuse me, Miss, no I ain't havin' it 
 I smacked him with the four pound, bitch hit the ground 
 Then I stepped off, dropped out the shit 
 Equipped with the dipped courdouroy Bailey's with the cream stitch 
 Powerhouse biscuits that blow roofs off 
 Rae watch is missin', you take ya boots off 
 And take off those chaaaaaiiiiiiinnnns 
 The fat fuck thought I was playin' so I started sprayin 
 Chicks hit the floor, bottles broke 
 The owner slid through beefin', duke threw the toast to his throat 
 We brought the noise like we here to promote 
 My man don't get his shit in four or five minutes yo we're leavin' with the 
 Vote 
 A gangsta's lotto, thirteen bodies and still climbin 
 Big shotties, bodied when they sniff body 
 We did our thing too we got to the Envy lobby 
 Our last four or five shots we see nobody

 Grab a nigga, search him if he front, fuck it, blow him! 
 Watchin' niggas foldin 
 The bartender got a shotgun in his hand 
 Let off, the wheelchair nigga got him and ran 
 Surround the Don, full body armor automatically on 
 The faggots passed off the watch and gone 
 (Yo y'all niggas ain't searchin' shit!) 
 Yo where the big mouth at? Niggas step up 
 Matter of fact nigga, lie the fuck up 
 Nigga tried to swing on G's but he a gentleman 
 Son, he dropped the dead arm but failed to see it 
 Two shot G's pealed his meat {*starts to fade out*} 
 Let's see, niggas tried to front like my niggas is weak

 Preferable for you and yours, let's blow, yo

 Who would have thought I would have made it y'all 
 Ten years later, still in the gid-game, the Clan, we was one the greatest 
 We did platinum back in '93, we painted pictures you could see 
 We was living who y'all tryin' to be 
 RZA had a vision, instead of cookin coke in the kitchen 
 He told the God, hit the booth and start spittin' 
 At first it was a dream to me, Ol' Earth buggin 
 Put your gun down, screamin that the streets is gon' be needin me 
 I did the Knowledge to the Wisdom that you spoke to me 
 The Wu become us, the world enbraced us 
 A new day, a new life for the God 
 Got a hood thing, watchin ""Ice Water"" evolve 
 Destined to build a mountain - niggaz is doubtin my work 
 Black millionaire, check what I'm worth 
 I gotta thank y'all for takin' in Lex, I appreciate it 
 I apoligize for keepin' y'all waitin

 (Raekwon) 
 Growin' up, we've been through hard times 
 Life on the streets, just tryin' survive 
 Plus my niggas got mouth's to feed 
 We sold to crack fiends, coke, ice and money machines 
 Shootin' at cops, them maggots tried to stop our C.R.E.A.M 
 But it won't stop, can't stop, my niggas locked down in a box 
 I feel your pain, I know you're tryin' to come home 
 All that weak bullshit, I had to leave it alone 
 Heard my mom's cryin' at night, we rap on the phone, I love you 
 Never meant to stress you out, do you wrong, yo I'm workin 
 Then move you from a block to a home 
 We came from nothin', seein' how the world is so cold 
 Some niggas comin' out of churches sellin' devil their soul, yo 
 My neighborhood is crime central, sort of like prisons and cops 
 One on lock, instead of tryin' to defend you 
 All that bullshit we've been through, time to draw the line right here 
 Got to stop now, time is the issue

 It's time to rebuild, teach our seeds, that guns don't kill 
 It's the nigga behind the trigger that will 
 Society's ill, blacks support seeds for their mills 
 Mentally brainwashed, time moves on, we stand still 
 I seen life through the birth of my son, I seen it all again 
 A soldier stuck in these streets, hopin' it's war within 
 Too late to fall now, I'm on now 
 Niggas is born now, we doin' good, we on tour now 
 Elevate your prosperity, I'm seein' shit with clarity 
 No longer on the low, pa, I couldn't handle thieves 
 Too much to live for, I just wanna poly and grow 
 Stack ones and watch my little dun's blow

 There they go, here we go 
 (Raekwon) 
 Aiyo Clientele Kidd 
 Layin in the crib gettin' ill money, those who 8 hours get gig 
 Got rugby's on and 4/5ths 
 Attractin' them niggaz I go against, the money was his 
 One nasty unit of murderers, all type of Goons'll watch 
 Then four minutes later they burgulars 
 I heard from the grapevine mine made it 
 Elevate the name up, this gift gotta reign and his game went up 
 And now he's stronger than ever, Nike jackets and Classics 
 Go against it and it's instant vendettas 
 He run things, gun down Kings, check the joint the kid flyin' in 
 Crib in Africa with two lions 
 Somethin' like the Prince of a jewel thief, so smack the millions 
 Came back wrapped it up, too sweet 
 The game is missin' somethin' unique 
 I put too much to fall back on, I rather just sleep 
 (Chorus x2: Polite) 
 CHEF! We designin', rhymin' with Diamonds 
 CHEF! Ice Water, it was all in the timin' 
 CHEF! He gave y'all niggaz bricks on consignment 
 CHEF! To the death and he Billboard climbin'

 Yeah uh 
 Yo Don Carta' bomb harder over nearly everybody 
 Very rarely you find me without the mini-shotti 
 Just waitin' for Rae to give met he cue and 
 You see about 100 Puerto Rican niggaz shootin' 
 Get down, lay down, we don't play around 
 I don't know what you heard but, we don't play around 
 It's cooked coke, but look, but what the fuck happened? 
 How you leave the dope game to pursue rappin'? 
 Already knowin' that ya shit was trash 
 Breathin' hard on the mic when yo' click is ass 
 All we tryin' to do is bring dignity to rap 
 And you kiddin' me? I'm literally the epitome of that 
 Uh, we much better than y'all, Terre-error the Squad 
 My niggaz set it when we get in the yard 
 Whether Marcy or Comstock, triggers 'pon cock 
 Straight punch in ya lung and you niggaz gon' drop 
 What? 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Yo yo yo shoot him in his mouth... (nah) 
 Fuck him, get the gasoline tell Terry to pull the act up 
 Bring him to Rae warehouse, hang him from hooks then skin his ass 
 As lame as he look he ready to cook (yeah) 
 And he pleadin' for mercy, bleedin' from his dome and he thirsty 
 The first week we made him eat shit! 
 Videotaped his wiz and I fucked his bitch 
 Made him watch me on the couch havin' fun with his kids 
 So what hurts more: is it me showin' love to ya fam? 
 Or you in the box laid under the floor? 
 Or keep you alive blow torchin' ya balls? 
 My murder chainsaw, ya bloods on my Scarface walls 
 Not even Ajax can clean that, Jack 
 We need that maintenace man shit that kill that greasy blood on contact 
 Finish you off 'cause I'm pressed for time 
 Your man and 'em will be next to die

 Yeah, runnin' through the stairs and shit 
 Trynna to get to the roof 
 Narcotos is on, some other shit

 My niggas won't stop till we straight, select bigger gates 
 We won't stop until we buyin' estate, yo 
 Pull out them burners and front, where I'm from 
 Better shoot something, if not, niggas won't salute nothing 
 (Raekwon) 
 Corner filled chains and Gucci glasses 
 The was the era when we flipped all the shh, on the store, splashed it 
 Had Dominicans runnin' and eatin' steak and cheese sandwiches 
 They in the back, braggin', the fifth slut 
 Fuckin' with a few niggas nieces, take it back when we would 
 Rock for a leases and stand on the speakers 
 I got the shit locked, I'll battle you, you, you and your whole gridlocked 
 Little shit, supported the beef 
 Fly Pierre couldn't tell me nothin' with a brand new beard 
 Couldn't wait, but kept survivin' the years 
 We sold crack daily, crack mad bailey's, crack faces and skulls 
 Sit back, watchin' the mack, twist carefully 
 It was them horrifyin' times, spit dimes 
 Police sneak up, I hope he know the time, get mine 
 Just livin' the ghettos, where we suppose stand loyal 
 But the game'll get you trapped when it's time, yo 
 (Raekwon) 
 The year's 1990, everybody grimey 
 Crack was what's in it, the vehicles was 1-90's 
 Young shorties be gettin' their bread, haunted by Jamaicans 
 Them niggas had their corners on red 
 Map the laws, runnin' cards, playin' bars 
 Mask the coke in the cars, twist the gan', mad, crackin' cigars 
 Smokin' through Queens, bitches stealin' Guess jeans 
 Get the scope on our stars, little did we know, we folow they dreams 
 Now we get around in live limosines, flash stacks in cuisines 
 Combat, get to smackin' the fiends, just max for a minute and lean 
 All the shit for the moment, slick omens, my opponents would scheme 
 We were shot downtown, hit trains, buy cables and remain 
 The illest villains, walkin' in spots 
 Playin' the corners, baby, vision or not 
 Said yo, and when it's on, we gon' rep and rock, nobody call the cops 
 (Raekwon) 
 Where all the major swingers, yo 
 Where all the live fresh, came home, up state livin' fly rangers 
 We rep them niggas and we love 'em 
 Sons, we hug 'em, they make it home and be gone in a week 
 That's some letters, all my niggas live together 
 Baby yellin' whatever, we all write in hands, nothin' but creeps 
 Hold me down, love, I'll hold you fatter 
 Watch me catch both of these actors, it's Ice Water throwin' hits in the cling 
 Bloodhounds is on you, goons is beamin' 
 Take it to the team to team, plot thing, blew you a bean 
 It's just a young poor hustlers thing 
 But your gun got a ring, if you gonna live like a young kid

 They call me Alexander Sean the Great 
 'Cause ya bitch said she love the way the dick talk all in the cake 
 I need this bank money, throw me the safe 
 All these killas involved, the cops'll fuck around and chalk the place 
 Yo they wonder why we hang with crooks

 Broke faggot nigga caught in a juks 
 I'm a pirate in this rap shit, I leave you niggas off the hook

 Either we leavin' with the bricks or we gon' leave with yo' kids 
 And we only got hours to live 
 So give up the ransom or find they ass up under the bridge 
 'Light never been afraid, so keep lookin' niggas 
 'Cause I'll rob yo' ass faster than some Brooklyn niggas 
 Yo this rap game twisted, everybody beefin 
 Everybody killas now and ain't nobody leakin 
 Smoke a lot of weed so I don't like to fight

 Picture me in the housing, serving much crack 
 Cat look at me, I'm real, lobbin' on the field 
 For real, I shot niggas shakin' their hands, I'm ill 
 Damn, one of them business man's 
 I just seen 'em murk a nigga, but he jerked him at the same time

 One of those niggas might try to get up on me 
 Yo, damn, I need to eat, and I'm a man 
 I'm a stand up, nigga, I'mma handle when I'm makin' my plan 
 Pop, I'll take two hundred bricks, hit me

 All ill technology to watch if I ran, he only gave me

 'Cause when he fed niggas after that, pussy and grass 
 Had made backs, eight labs, his date was Miss Mass- 
 Achusetts, Cap eatin' fruit, tongue in his ass 
 You can't fuck with the cartel, you barked at it 
 Jabbed her and shot her in the back, I can't stand the bird 
 Word to furs, I need big wizes 
 He looked at me, ""Huh, exactly, Chef go after big bitches"" 
 Frozen burner henchman, flash the great 
 Lookin' nine on me, rhinestones, no, them shits is dime stones 
 Hold a million dollar pound, bust something, don't trust nothin'

 Maybe a little bit, the Mediene Cartel will fail 
 Diego his horse, with George Young 
 Yo, will argue over large sales, hittin' Cuba with lumps, yeah 
 Call them niggas drug barons, eighty billion workers sniff 
 Gettin' lift ownin' Miami yo 
 Flips got bigger, makin' more trails 
 Set it out of nowhere when coppin' a jail, I'm eatin' fresh veal 
 Pa-Blow, the largest nigga involved 
 The arsenal will have sixty three hundred murders 
 Livin' in apartments, wild he violated flight a Bianca 
 Took two hundred niggas down but two men houndin' him 
 The fuckin' cockroches posin' the on six million dollars sold 
 We're eatin' enchilada, goat cheese pasta 
 Yeah we're drippin' it with more salsa 
 And then they rushed in, found him on the roof dead in his boxers 
 But it wasn't him.

 No need to cry, never get worried 
 You gon' live forever, word to mother 
 'Cause she raised you right, and you got fifty-one brothers

 Try me, P.C.'ll put a clip in a nigga 
 Fuck a hole, my bullets'll dig a ditch in a nigga 
 Listen, I've been reppin', only pack big weapons 
 One shot to the stomach, you missin' ya midsection 
 I'm off the wall, dog, I could off ya balls 
 Stick his ass to the rooftop, toss 'em off 
 Hit the Ave with the rooftop off the porch 
 I get money 'cause it costs to floss, nigga you feelin' me? 
 And if not then fuck what you gotta deal with me 
 I've only been here for a minute but haters wanna get rid of me 
 P.C. creep with at least three heats 
 And a shotgun stashed underneath the backseats 
 (Stumic) 
 Niggas actin' like you don't feel a draft 
 You seen ya man? Tell him I'ma kill his ass 
 And I don't, wanna talk I want a mill in cash 
 I come through 'tards shittin', lookin' ill in the past 
 'Cause it's the, Ice Water, don't get it confused 
 And one false move'll cause me to spit at you dudes 
 It's Stumic, motherfucker and I'm pickin' ya food 
 And ain't no one out you know that my niggas'll do you 
 Let's spit on 'em, rush these niggas 
 And crush several fuckin', will leave a dent out ya liver 
 Only kid in the hood with a mustard ninja 
 Heard you broke down good, well I fucked ya sister 
 (Chorus 2X: Stumic) 
 Eh yo we Wyld in Da Club, style in the club

 Eh yo the cards are dealt, the words are spoken 
 Nigga, welcome to the Hell, the gates is open (uh-huh) 
 Gatekeeper, first degree murder through the speaker 
 Who deep enough to flow with the reaper? 
 Stuck in the middle, I spit a little riddle 
 Leavin' niggas crippled, my niggas ball 'em like Kerry Kittles 
 You niggas makin' it hard, it's really kinda simple 
 If a nigga gotta pull it out I'm puttin' it in ya temple 
 (Ultra) 
 Official I do this, rude maneuver 
 I use the Rugers to keep the bullets movin' through ya 
 Weak anatomy, fuck the small talk and flattery 
 Ya power is weak, to beef you need much more batteries 
 Keep it genetic, or dead it, Ice Water Inc. we said it 
 Whoever so-called did it or said it, promote it and spread it 
 Fake it or front it, get ambushed and confronted 
 With slugs in ya head, back, chest and stomach 
 Niggas don't want it or ask for it, so we give it to 'em 
 Dead in the club and let them things spit and rip through 'em dead in the club 
 Is you gon' fuck around and be the nigga dead in the club?

 Lately... I had a love that would ignite all the fire 
 The desire would leave, for you I'd admire 
 Lately... you seem all corrupt 
 I've had enough and you forced me to hide under covers 
 Drove me to arms of another 
 (Raekwon) 
 Broke the top of goose-down sheets, kissed her on the neck 
 Real love, hope this ain't the last time we meet 
 Felt like a King who had a Queen want him 
 I usually deserve hotels, this one's the gift, slick 
 On our eye-to-eye contact, body movement, all on the grind 
 A lady's starin' at me, all in my mind 
 Sayin', ""Boo, I gotta live with you, let's connect and be a bridge"" 
 You stay three forths and I'ma wiz you 
 (Tekitha) 
 Months ago... you came to me 
 Told me... love me forever 
 See... time has passed... and lonely days 
 Have rid his head now... stormy weather 
 But out of the rain... came some delight 
 I ain't ashamed... I know that it's right 
 The way that I'm feelin'.. 
 He touches me... in ways I like 
 Says things you won't... won't day or night 
 Givin' me healin... I'm leavin' 
 'Cause you wanted to know... that is the reason 
 (Tekitha) 
 The only set back in my state of grace 
 Is that... the love is real... for you and him 
 In different ways... and. 
 You're out in space... yes here on Earth it's fun to play 
 I wish you were present so my love wouldn't go astray 
 And he gives what I need. 
 Quenches my thirst when you say ""Girl, please"" 
 That's a waste of my breath 
 It's funny to me... that you get upset 
 And I told you quite often 
 I'ma fill up the space... did ya think I was talkin' 
 Out the side of my neck... 
 You left me alone, what did you expect? 
 (Raekwon) 
 I'm dead in my sleep, she's standin' over the kid 
 I'm terrified, shorty was deep 
 I had my hand in her account plus livin' in a lab 
 Like a Count, I had to go six shorties was pink yo 
 She had the yolk on me that's when I went broke 
 We used to flip coke together, get boasted and float 
 We split real bread, we was large 
 We had our weddin' in the garage 
 And then she stopped reviewin' my bars 
 Hold up

 Heeeeeey... yeah

 Ran up in Kay crib, lay daddy rest 
 I had to break free, police on me and they FB's 
 Yelling ""I think his name Lex, that's his aunt, freeze"" 
 That's when I hit the window, indo' coming out the back room 
 Boom, Pretty and his man, Black Caesar 
 Damn, they saw me and they bustin' at me 
 Cab just missed me, plus them goochie frames, foul, that's six fifty 
 Stop back at suite, them leaf defense slid through my man garden 
 Yelled out 'pardon', kept it moving, peace 
 Build be gone, ain't no honor amongst thieves 
 Please, plus they heard I'm getting parmagane cheese 
 And I won't stop moving till the metal dig me 
 Say word, yo, make 'em work for it, young rookie, y'all need me 
 That's when it is, what it is, if it's that or the cup 
 But in the ill gangstas book what they niggaz do is

 I ain't no joke, I used to let the mic smoke 
 Now I slam it when I'm done, give me my ten G coat 
 To perform another song, 'cause I won't let 
 Nobody press up and mess up, the scene I wet 
 I like to stand in the crowd, and watch niggas wonder 
 Damn, then think about, then you wonder 
 Clan, they just rag shit, rip shit, bruise shit 
 Maybe that's the rap shit, I gotta prove shit 
 Even if it's jazz or the quiet storm 
 Now flip the beat up, convert it to a hip hop joint 
 Write a rhyme and graffiti in, every show you see me in 
 Deep concentration, swift like the beamer, kid 
 Go with the crowd, while my lyrics spit flames 
 I flow-tate the vowel, 'cause it's all in my veins 
 Another remedy, fly niggas is enemy 
 'Cause I'm live as some rap niggas with energy 
 Now do it, 'cause I'mma put the nine on pause 
 My sharks beaming, catch you on the side of the store 
 Call your bluff, make you stare in my face, ya team suck 
 Remember me? The one you got your ideas from 
 How soon you start to suffer, until you get stuck up 
 When you start to fuck up, that's when you get bucked up 
 Bitin me, you think you dope, I smash your boat, with bad coke 
 You should of wrote, because I ain't no joke

 Without a re-up to connect to 
 Think of all the weak product you slept through 
 Time's up, I'm sorry I kept you

 I was a fiend, before I was seventeen 
 I melt the microphone like blowing some evergreen 
 It's all in the making, from where hip hop was originated 
 Peace to the streets, the bubblers, mark and dated 
 'Cause I grab the mic, now I say ""yes y'all"" 
 Y'all yell 'scrape it', then I'mma say 'let's ball' 
 Come on, cool, 'cause I'mma get on rep 
 Twist a 'dro on the speaker, pull the snub and then flex 
 Back to them crabs, y'all niggas had y'all laughs 
 And then I spaz on the rhymes I splashed 
 From back to your brother gun, then I grab the double pump 
 Then this the opposite, and ask if another come 
 'Cause I'mma get busy, get dough with my team, yup 
 I don't need a cigarette, know what I mean? 
 I'm raging, rip up the stage and don't it amazing 
 'Cause every line is laid in 
 Caught up, thoughts are sort a, an addiction 
 Bags of pies, smell of bricks, kid 
 Vocals vocabulary, the stage is a suction 
 The mic is a draino, volcanos erupting 
 Lines overblowing, gradually glowing 
 Every thing is written in the cold, slick and coin' 
 Slide... my thoughts'll glide

 Nine silver Ferrari's, hard body 
 Moving through the town, with brown on us 
 Clowns don't love us, discussed and ropes on 
 The oath, the big mold bread, the stages is red 
 You never reapproach, bulletproof down in diesel shit 
 Lethal with the pen, the sequel, bitch 
 Rich will deceive you, flying at 90, the boss 
 Red Porsche, this the time when I get mine 
 I rhyme till I'm hoarse, good weather, caught in the cross 
 Break porcelain when I rap, it's only right 
 I flash on the source, extra my curriculars major 
 Register this, we miss you will die later 
 Caught in a bliss, this stormy weather winter hat 
 Moving in with Benz jackets and action 
 This is all about who get endorsed 
 This for stabbers, night time paper Mick Jaggers 
 Jag Benz Maybach braggers, caught up in the sport 
 Speak French and eat with the chimps, the underground academy 
 I rap rapidly and clap at the pimps 
 One shot'll blow a hostile's wig off 
 Me crafted by the mobsters, Vatican's blast ya shit off 
 I'm caught up in the level of largeness 
 Chef Oliver, a denny boy, getting money, we mob kids 
 Pushing through Paris, lavish lifestyle with no marriage 
 Only big Euro's, we hero's

 Studying law, buying North Faces 
 Tried by the police, yo, straight up and down

 Son, might name him Rich Porter, style, Law and Order 
 Copped them quarters, it's real, blowing out in Florida 
 Displaying a game, frame, I'm adoring her 
 Blasting music, I'mma lose it, shorty romance the music 
 Just grind, don't dance to it, flexin' with a sun dress on 
 Shorty refreshin', less you stressed, stop swarmin' on her 
 Yellin', it's all made basic, taste it 
 Anybody lace this here, you can blaze it 
 Rinaldo stepped up, what, ""Lex, you know I got it lined up"" 
 Bust ya gun from the side, what? 
 Take this thought in mound, your frame might be a dime 
 But the brain power might not shine 
 Shorty had a good head once, rolling up blunts, damn 
 She fucked up, got caught in the crunch 
 Now, down go her lifestyle 
 She on the FDR now, with a Audi J, bugging out 
 Stop that drinking, you wild, project chick, yo 
 Won't even tuck her chain, nigga, that's foul 
 Got caught up in the number run, dunn 
 I need to get my life back, son, share one 
 Lex laid it out, but she stunt, enter and still smoke blunts 
 Shit ain't real, she yelling ""Fuck everyone"" 
 Yup, caught up in the midst, I mean glitz 
 Went from doorags to rich, now he blue hat and switch 
 I guess, the live way to rap it, shorty went backwards 
 Now she stuck with a dirty Guess jacket 
 Keep on, giving out the jewels wrong 
 Who wrong? Who want? Who trynna-trynna act like you never knew wrong 
 Now it's raining, now I'm maintining, gaining 
 Probably gaming with positive aiming, long dane it 
 Stepped in, jumped in the car, fuck God 
 Put the Wisdom for Knowledge, you bond, whine too hard 
 Shaking her ass, walking out to the garage, you large 
 Fuck men, fuck who weighing nods 
 Stopped, took a peak at the stars, the Zodiac, a fine Mars 
 Or lose it for a chick behind bars 
 Wash, waking up Lars, aiyo collect call Taj' 
 Let's take a half a million in the cards 
 Laying up, at the Laborage, say I need a massage 
 Stressed, jumping out the Guess jumper, charged 
 Wifey material, make sure y'all observe the ariel

 Two hundred thou' on my throat 
 That's only half of what my wife ice cost 
 Phonecall, hearin another boss got his life lost 
 Well, wipin' sand off of my toes 
 Read a book called ""Catcher in the rye"", I chose 
 Some Bob Marley then I plotted a scheme 
 To make me and Bump Knux more rich 
 Then I got me a team, he got 'em a team 
 He tryin' to buy G-force with missile launchers 
 Tired of walkin' around with beef, with that pistols on us 
 C-4's better I'm callin up some B-More killers 
 To come and bleed you 
 As sure as the sun's in the sky you'll surely die 
 You washed up, fuck your people

 Jewelry trucked up, niggas know they can't fuck with me 
 If you my target, you probably wouldn't wanna be 'em 
 My legacy royal with statues in a museum 
 With numerous artifacts, hanging in the mosoleum 
 Type living room setting is bigger than the land of freedom 
 I'm parked on the corner, while pretty bitches holla ""hello"" 
 I'm another breed, different species from you fellows 
 Technically, it's kinetic, I'm genetically better 
 I'm something you will never see, far as you can remember 
 My buzz exceding rapidly, no matter how it's measured 
 Like an unstoppable machine in the Mohabi Desert 
 So hungry I smell it, success up in my after taste 
 Still spit till it's painful, despite the money in the safe 
 I see you resentful, stay up in your place 
 And while they be morning your death, we in a State of Grace 
 Designing, I'm perfect with timing, take it back to Rucker

 Me and my homey, we bought like forty things up 
 Long as you owe me, you won't get a damn thing, son 
 Shoot off your kangol, while you in the plane, fronting 
 Stop, admirin' me, y'all should of fired me 
 'Cause when I come back, it's me and my diary 
 None of that bullshit, few men got tired of me

 Explain the saga, fuck yo, your chain liver 
 Fuck the blinging, have my money by five, to me 
 Y'all 'pose to bring it, fuck you and your whole variety 
 I'm bringing my hammers, I beat it like, five to three

 I'm back with some haters, they wipe shit and blast pussies up 
 Bloody ya blazer, take all your man cush weed 
 Yeah, I'm coming just to claim a title 
 Rap is boring, niggas need another idol 
 When I'm gone, just let off like forty rifles 
 Aiming at rappers, biting off the God's bible 
 I destroy you, lyrically, I spit oil 
 This is war, you can never escape, conio 
 Y'all some lamesters, never seen a yard soiled 
 When it's on, now we gon' see who's loyal

 Check my hot broad, I dropped the Porsche

 Hide the safe, nigga, lock the doors 
 No respect for the cops and laws

 With whips and spears, and rough diamonds out of Syria

 That's how we make it happen 
 That's how we break it down 
 Hood all day nigga 
 Watch how we take the town 
 That's how we do the do 
 Just know who is who 
 Acknowledge me all day and understand

 Uh-huh, what up son? Yeah 
 Maintaining, maintaining, you know? 
 You good, right? Everything proper, still, right? 
 Of course, come on, man, what's the matter wit you, man? 
 Ain't nothing, I just want us to be on 
 (Chorus: Method Man) 
 Tell a friend, it's that symbol again, that W 
 Coming through, bust a shot on your block, give me a suu 
 Get it right, all my chicks hold ya tits, let's get it in 
 All my niggas take a toke off this weed, let it begin 
 Here we go, yo, y'all already know what it do 
 Brand new, nigga, back from the slums, it be the Wu 
 Now throw ya W's up, back from the slums, it be the Wu 
 (Raekwon) 
 Love to dress a lad, get rocked, hundred bags, black doorags 
 Ski masks is on, g-wags 
 Don't try to take pictures, relax, still in the grass 
 You'll learn respect, burst when I ask 
 Rhyme master busy, wizzy on the subject 
 Love Deck, thug battle, drug vest, snub sets, iller than most 
 Night time toast, gorillas in boats, three votes 
 Villains is killa, gangstas flip notes 
 Hibernation yo, switch up, liver nation, fly information 
 Vivid vacation, deliberation moments 
 Move like '91 Romans, cloning everything 
 Gents only, the rent's on the stove, I'm in Rome 
 Maxed out, Amex style, my team gram bandits 
 Make a move and get blown off the planet, baby 
 Hold that cannon, just understand we got the whole shit 
 Padlocked down, my niggas won't have it 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Aiyo, jumping out of Benz wagons, my family live in the Hill 
 They call us Bin Ladins, laughing, turbaned up 
 Fuck around get murdered up, these streets is like radio beef 
 So watch how the kid turn it up 
 Bulletproof tuxes, knuckle gauge clobbering busters 
 Eighteen niggas, bringing the ruckus 
 Flame throwers on our backs and shoulders, the rusty joints still work 
 The trey eight'll blow one in your douljah 
 When it's mad heat I'm mad calm, walk around 
 Go collect, 36, over G bomb 
 My inner strength flowing, I mastered chi kung 
 Y'all Planet of the Apes, standing next to King Kong 
 Forensic files, ultraviolet hype, sky blue Bowels 
 Laying niggas like ceramic tile 
 I'm like Urlacher, beasting at the top of the pile 
 Kneeing niggas in the nuts, goddamn damn I'm foul 
 (Method Man) 
 We blow money, got game, hungry, we pop things 
 Look bummy, grams in my pocket, Chef cook for me 
 Blue Magic bundles, I'm dope, but on the humble 
 I'm a good dude, don't short change me, see that's a hood rule 
 Beer drinkin', Cuban Linking, new way of thinking 
 God me thinking meth, break the handcuffs, run out the precinct 
 This is hard body, hard knocks, if you pushing that hard rock 
 Then let these niggas know off top 
 We rock fitted, dropkick it, I lived it if not quit it 
 I pitched it, my pops sniffed it, need business, I'm not finished 
 I'm *sniff* too hot wit it, you bitching, the plot thicken 
 I'm shitting the glock, spitting, if nigga don't stop snitching 
 Just what the block missing, the two-seater wit the top missing 
 And two divas wit they tops missing 
 Now that's living to me, I'm what these kids is killing to be 
 But I don't want my children to be"
72,Raekwon,hiphop,Penitentiary,"Come here, pussy, prosthetic hard ass nigga 
 Yo, where them Levi's that I left on ya bunk, nigga?

 {Bundy: Yeah, yo, I got you, you want some of these donuts?} 
 (Nah, I'm good, just make sure you handle my man right, one.) 
 We up at three mart, blowing, little dust to lift the branch up 
 The watch she had was Bulgari, golden, Spanish kid let him hold it 
 He said he hit him with three cartons of menthol, the kid let him roll with it 
 (The face had snow in it, the bass in his voice 
 Now he's acting like he ain't rich and po' in it) 
 Crock pots are steaming, Jasmine rice and Jack Mack 
 With cornflake batter, it's cold in here 
 10:45 we lock in, pull out the headphones, jump in the bunk 
 (The tunes is knocking) Knowing all my goons is clocking 
 Two C.O.'s is on the cat walk (Yo, Spoons, what's popping?) 
 Yo, it ain't nothing, baby, you cool? 
 Yeah, I'm getting that rest, you know that G.E.D. shit with the school? 
 (True, guess that's what it do 
 But on the low I got two big gem stars I'm sliding to you 
 Matter of fact they gon' hide in ya food 
 All you do is push the grits out the way, then you get up and move 
 Go to sleep, nigga, go 'head and rest, I'm a finish my count 
 I'm a set you out, later my dude, one) 
 Mop wringer magic, mess hall murder's the best 
 Come through the yard, getting fed lead burgers 
 Testing anything with bling 
 Fresh sneakers, we the best teachers 
 True, watch me move in the cling 
 Six A.M., the cells unlock 
 Horn the child, I'm half sleep, yo, hearing the pots 
 I see the same ice grills, bum niggaz talking to me 
 With coal in they eye, I can't finish my meal 
 (Under the grits, two pieces of steel) 
 Then Spoon had left, we got guns though, we trying to chill 
 Big Will walked in, him and Seville

 Homey hold that, the four black, we black down 
 Gold Jag', Ol' laughing yo, yo, what the fuck happened? 
 They clapped him and the scalp it flew that way 
 Yo why they capped him? It went through his lap 
 Snatched his Audemars Piguet, took his mango, get at 
 He painted it, slayed blocks, aiming it 
 Hit a child, this is foul, but he styled with his flamer flaming shit 
 Teddy with the red Range, supercharged Kangols 
 Rae and Ghost CD in his change, yo, Angel 
 Spanish kid lingo, all I know is where he hang though, kept it sideways, angle 
 Good brush, tough talk, keep it real, daddy, got them thangos

 X6's red, up in Albany with the dreds 
 Bags of black, fuck the feds 
 Papers in Aruba's, gold tuba from Bermuda 
 In my living room spreads, cameras action, got the calico cranked 
 Where the food at? Hood jewelry on, I gots to do that 
 Long chain hatchet flooded up, you knew that 
 Baby blue mack, stones on the nozzle stick 
 Bulletproof brocco's with the Jew bitches, all I got is two cracks 
 Gazelle lenses, clear rude wraps, bagging every ziplock 
 And my peoples sit around, cops split that 
 High potent white kit kats, we sell up in the hood 
 Going door to door, every floor, every get back

 I am very grateful! 
 Are you ready? 
 I'm ready 
 Uh, down on 40 Deuce, when I was a shorty duke 
 That's when I first got the Naughty goose 
 Now I come through in a sported coupe 
 I know what you better do, stop talking bout what you outta do 
 My crack spot is still portable 
 Funerals are still affordable, I'm better than all of you 
 I'm in the hood scraping 'em, Jadakiss, Rae and 'em 
 Y'all lame niggas, come uptown, spend a day with 'em 
 Bigger ones, bootleg liquor runs, blow something, nigga 
 Let the Earth smoke hit your lung, get your guns 
 The economy is down, so you already know 
 It's gon' be a lot of homi's in the town 
 That's why I'm still bringing the seed back 
 The sneakers that I can't pronounce, that cost a G stack 
 Niggas in the yard, got this on repeat, black 
 Fuck saving hip hop, we bringing the streets back, what? 
 Player spit snipping, different color wallies on 
 Bliffen had to take 'em off, they fucked up the soles, flipped it 
 I'm forever zooted, crushed up glass, I'm just flashing through it 
 Nine times out of ten, suede down at the Jumer 
 Maybach bloomers, playing rumors, card shark 
 Getting cash money, take a loan, hit this tuner 
 We onion head niggas, the gun gooners 
 Put us together, he run sea, I run land, with one ruger 
 Stop playing, you know we run rap, you know we done that 
 Stop fronting, son, put the gun back 
 We came with the containers, besides having the flamers 
 My Mexican man's is famous 
 Running through the streets, the bulldog 
 Conehead hoodies on, eighteen five for footballs 
 Maxed like I'm under a good wall, good G 
 Good recipe, good status, a hood broad 
 I used to move brown rectangles 
 Roll you a blunt, then smoke you with death's angel 
 Chrome trey pound is making your neck dangle 
 Blue trey eight is leaving your chest mangled 
 It's math but the gun could kill you at all angles 
 Leave the toast home, I'm leaving you all strangled 
 Louis loafers on the Jaguar, gas peddles 
 You got the cops with you, you ain't even half ghetto 
 (Not even half) We neither here nor there 
 But if, you was over here, you would have been got aired 
 (Been got aired) Like a pair of white Nike's on a summer day 
 Pointing the gun away, I could kill you niggas a hundred ways 
 Mine's in a place that yours ain't, so I'm wearing war paint 
 For the day that I see the Lord saint 
 Blowing the purple haze, playing The Purple Tape 
 Fuck with Chef or the Ghost, get left with a purple face 
 Too bad, your courage will be the death of you"

 Move! Let's go. police, come on son! They right down the block, nigga 
 Y'all got that? You check the train station, one son (Good!) 
 All of our fathers is bank robbers, holding techs 
 Eighths of heroin, shooting in the steps 
 In the 60's, niggas was poor, check the revelation 
 Now we rock six fifties in the snow 
 AK's, AR's, wire jaws, say ours 
 Wirecell frames in the rain, Marvin Gaye on 
 Goose bubbles on, stuck in the huddle, trynna transform 
 Every gram action to a sandstorm 
 Fly through my block you live, make a bitch stop 
 Have your shit cocked, yo, niggas might dive on you 
 All we wear is Filas, Guess, suede fronts, beehives 
 Bally sneakers, big jewels, Levi's 
 Back to slinging every 45 minutes 
 G's fleeing, fiends is in the building OD'ing 
 The drugs is in the ground, burners on the side of our legs 
 It's gonna happen so you know we low keying 
 Yeah, can't sell in here, yup, I said it 
 Yeah, can't tell in here, they won't credit niggas 
 Just a lifestyle, the holders with the drugs is dreaded 
 Just a typical day to get wiped out 
 Broad day jungle, living with the rodents 
 The goons'll run through, blow a bag and hunt you 
 Always flaky, calluses hands my man's 
 Come through the avenue, Swiss cheese patrants 
 Blood that flood the hall, every head'll drop 
 Jump in the Maybach, switch the station 
 These rap niggas is wash, hang 'em on the pole, no head 
 Pajama top, handcuff with a gosha 
 We realer than the Spanglers Rep Posse squad that's dangerous 
 Take it back to the Lee's and Wranglers 
 Take what we want, explain this 
 Famous for my kitchen knives, reigns and the fifths are stainless 
 Gun down your trooper, grenade your coupe up 
 Plain and simple niggas is poo-putt 
 Fuck with my crew, what? Either you shot or you cut

 Word... a powerful brother, man, he was live 
 Raekwon:he was a powerful general, the smell from his breathe was ballantine this it was the year 89' 
 He stayed the freshest, polo boots, wallies with them colorful low goose 
 Coming from Medina, we boost 
 We up in A&S, slipping and dipping to bedstuy 
 Native, he used to beatbox, thousands'll listen 
 Yo, that's before, the wu got on, him and allah just' 
 And RZA, came to the island one morn' 
 A nigga could dance to slow music, outdrink any nigga 
 On the benches, while we hitting reefer, he sold loosies 
 Five foot seven a legend was born, Russel ""ason"" Jones 
 I know for his braids and lessons 
 A wiseman with knowledge 120, kept a flag on his chest 
 A right hand, you quick, serving you remy 
 Yo, lets toadt to the fallen, lost forgotten 
 Aiyo, if niggas could hear me, then roll up some broccoli 
 Ason, the heart of a lion, a purified mind 
 The way he did it, with a mic and some wine 
 I would never forget the days we used to sit back 
 Days I be all up in the crib, listening, holding, align him and yo I just miss this nigga 
 And now I understand the meaning of love when I kissed the nigga

 So so so it's like you got to keep it real nahwhatimean? 
 Raekwon: 
 He had a heart of gold, intelligent soul from day one 
 Loud as the ferry, best friend was momma Cherry 
 Sweet lady, BK baby, she taught Dirty 
 How to cook, clean, singing the songs, say the 
 Old school dances and O.E., Ballantine, the wine 
 We sip, while we sat with the O.G.'s 
 Knowledge of self, good health 
 The fortunes that came with the game, had my brother insane 
 It's like wealth ain't enough to live for 
 But if you got love in your heart, just believe in yourself 
 That was the black man rap, baby Jesus in the black Land' 
 Few jewelry pieces with his gold fangs, his fam 
 (Brooklyn Zu) you know my brother was ill 
 The first dude to say, ""Yo, keep it real"" 
 Yeah, the lover, the father, the hustler, the rap professor 
 Now he with Allah, that's a blessing 
 (Interlude: ~Ol' Dirty Bastard Sample~) 
 See, it's like, ok, where I come from 
 In my neighborhood, my people know me 
 Youknowhatimsaying? See, if I try to come any different 
 They ain't gon' respect me no more 
 Youknowhatimsaying? Because they -- you know people 
 Got their thing about themselves, you know 
 If you come from the neighborhood, youknowhatimsaying 
 You couldn't, you couldn't get out the neighborhood 
 But you could never take the neighborhood out of the people 
 Youknowhatimsaying, but if you try to like jump and crossover 
 To the other side, people understand that, and they don't like that 
 That's why they don't be buying people music 
 See, we keeps it real, and we always gon' keep it real

 Otherwise, you will learn bad ways 
 You have been confined here, for one month already 
 But you still haven't grasped this basic principal 
 I feel sorry for you, my boy 
 I've been living in this world 
 Not knowing where I'm going (knowing where I'm going) 
 This world ain't showing 
 That it's gonna get better, better (yeah, it's gonna be trouble again) 
 My days getting shorter, my nights getting longer 
 My cell getting smaller, my son getting taller 
 I exercise my mind, my body getting stronger 
 But my blood getting colder, heart getting harder 
 My chances for appeal, getting slimmer 
 My skin getting brighter, my hair getting thinner 
 See, when you stressed out, you could age fast in here (have mercy) 
 I done seen weak niggas not last a year, so before lights out 
 I write my kids every night, kiss the stamp on the kite 
 And say a prayer, I hope it lands safe in this flights 
 I pray they sleep safe through the night 
 Try to teach my son right, give him some jewels 
 But it's hard to raise my boy from this visiting room 
 Many cells turned to prisoner's tombs 
 I just pray I don't die in here, and last night I almost cried a tear 
 (Have mercy) 
 To all my gun holders, stand up, get it 
 'Cause when the killas come around, it's on 
 Bullets get blown, warn 'em and they re-up fast 
 Say some back shit, your flagship gone 
 Can't play the building no more 
 Can't hang around by the store no more 
 It's really on, you a dickhead 
 Now you a dead man with no hand 
 Now you can't believe you jammed 
 Between my six niggas, sixty years, stay in the crispy airs 
 Hundreds, blunted, we up top, switching lairs 
 Money equal power, horror equal real when borrowed 
 Ratchet barrel under your ears 
 Mean streets in the middays, they robbers, but life's so hard 
 Even the cops clutter us to starve us (have mercy) 
 The killas is star struck, look at the cars and trucks 
 Rambo guns, it's hard to get luck 
 Whether fail or a come up, your number is up 
 Period, make you bleed Caesarean 
 Chop through your body, leave you right in the lobby 
 Hear me, kid? Extra holes right in your derriere 
 The blitzes, the rushes'll touch something, back in the cells 
 Two days later, yup, back in them cuffs again 
 Or leaning on the customers, hustlers, my hood illustrious 
 Marvelous raps, screw on mufflers (have mercy) 
 Ah, ah, ah, ah 
 It hurts my heart, to see what's going on 
 Young men dying now, children going when they're born 
 Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh whoa 
 Oh no, oh whoa, where is this world going to? I don't know"

 We got some culinary cats right here, we need you (we'll kill him if he 
 Fault)

 Ayo, rappers stepping to me, they want a brick, son 
 But I'm the Chef, my price is 26, son 
 Move up, about 32 of those and open locker dough 
 Soldier got locked up, blow killed the doctor 
 Flamboyant police is X fives, watching my lofts 
 So many leeches I just left it and walked 
 My flow wicked, Miami money, moving and ridicly 
 Geico on the arm froze, rose gold with me 
 Take baths with white women, lingerie see-through 
 Taking trips to Iran, my Spanish nigga people 
 Selling drugs to Flatbush, call my nigga Cecil 
 Snub with the black gloves, on half-moon Greek do 
 Killed him in the Bahamas, his wife ran, white van pulled up 
 They caught him out in Brooklyn with a white man 
 Slutted out, rosed out, sister was gone, she geeking 
 She threw the rifle in her mouth and said 'good evening' 
 Yup, Paul Wall grill line, be getting money, crime thief 
 I know her from Africa, pretty smile, nine teeth 
 Gold joints, frames only, Louis Vuitton, Pony 
 Leather with the matching sweater on, you owe me 
 (Chorus: Raekwon) 
 Knock the ash off the blunt, confront niggas who cunt 
 Swing an ax, tax niggas rhyme different from cats 
 Specialize in mic rippers, splashes 
 We the last skippers, big rocks and the block will stick 
 (Cappadonna) 
 Beefsteak Charlie niggas eat and they get fat 
 Chase heads up and down the block and kill rats 
 Skilled with the gats, even feds don't know where the shells at 
 The shell trapped up in nice crib with four packs 
 Four macs, caught a nice cell for four stacks 
 Yeah, me and my nigga Arafat 
 Gotta escape but we'll be right back, real soon 
 Chef cook it up, we got a date with real goons 
 Telling you Ghost, my connect crazy with the wreck 
 Pythons used to talk to her sister named Yvette 
 I speed it up, me and the Linx, was getting weeded up 
 I beat it up, yeah I hit that, but I ain't seed it up 
 Meanwhile, back on the block, we seen two trucks 
 Then the windows rolled down, we see these two fucks 
 Soon as they jumped out, see these tools bust 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Yo, I lit a booger up, rocks is gone, so we bagging up all shape 
 Binoculars, scanners, we all listen to jake 
 Ran out of baggies, my mouth is dry 
 Got them dirty joints all scattered, don't act surprised 
 Nah, nigga the currency rushes like popping a wheelie 
 Holding a pipe with one hand, the other down in the Bentleys 
 You know how it be with the peppermint Clarks 
 Throwing darts at a hoodrat 
 Getting slow necked all up in The Bronx 
 That's all me, thirty four shines, forty four lines 
 I just chill like Aaron Hall, writing raw rhymes 
 Like, threw Kool-Aid rubies in a lemonade bezel 
 When I was 12 in the church, I started packing that metal 
 A deuce deuce, my supplier was Loose Bruce 
 Ever since I had the drop, my instinct was to shoot-shoot 
 This ain't For the Love of Ray J, it's for the love of the AK 
 'Cause you can get scratched like AJ 
 Cuban Link Dynasty has emerged, this rap shit stop 
 I have a team of niggas moving my furs"

 Get the joint, {hurry up, son} 
 Kill all those niggas, man

 You don't even know what you talking bout, man 
 You fabricating the wrong shit, man 
 Both of them niggas was stand up niggas, man 
 Niggas went to war! You know how it go 
 In order to be a general, nigga, you still gotta be a soldier (Gotta 
 Kill ya bloodclot) 
 Speak about what happened then, man, for real, fuck it, aiyo -- 
 Check this out, man, what niggas is doing over here, man?

 (Who you? Who ya talk about?) Straight up, man, we know how real it could get 
 (Who ya talk to to?) But it's gon' be repercussions 
 (Verse 1: Raekwon) 
 Punch broke the dread's jaw, pulled the four out 
 And went off, told him that he can't sling his raw 
 When he fell, yo, he broke his wrist, his bangles flew off 
 His Balleys was scuffed, then he blew a kiss 
 Bleeding out the side of his ear, niggas was staring 
 And the silk shirt was ripped off, Punch cut his hair 
 Razors was bloody, he kept hitting, dread grabbed his shirt 
 Showing his stomach, the kid had zippers on him 
 Bitches was flipping, they grabbed Tasha, caught her for a Louis 
 Snatched her titties right up out the bitch bra 
 No selling over here, Jack, heard the dread mumble 
 'You be dead in a week' then he stumbled back 
 Little young Keyon rushed him, yeah, shorty was a vet 
 Gillette soldiers, shorty hit the neck 
 Blood squirted, look like laundry detergent, the dread fell out 
 Right from there, he gon' need a surgeon

81,Raekwon,hiphop,Catalina,"Where is he? 
 Concentrating on the job 
 Don't disturb the Doctor 
 Yeah 
 Word up 
 Who said we ain't the definition of exclusive shit? 
 Real rap, you know? 
 Yeah, this is multi-expensive rap here brother 
 Word up 
 Time to recreate the power 
 You know what it is man 
 Nothing but gangsta shit baby 
 Let's go Doc I need that prescription 
 Ey yo (ey yo) 
 (Verse 1 Raekwon The Chef) 
 I grew up on the foul side 
 Nickel-bag valcyte 
 Purple tops, two for fives 
 I had seven grams 
 Outside with my eleven man's 
 On the corners with a pocket full of contrabands 
 Running up and down fire-escapes, narcs coming 
 Jump in the window let your Nikes fly, hide the flakes 
 Guess up in the hill it was real to me 
 What a nigga woulda did if you steal from me 
 All my life around drug niggas villains who want millions 
 Niggas with them hoodies on with teks in the building 
 Mad fiends, bags and green, Gillette razors, fly neighbors 
 All our blazers designer jeans 
 That's why we live (yup) 
 Niggas need shit in their crib 
 Go broke, you go and rope you a Vick 
 It's just full-time stragglers 
 Niggas try to take your place 
 And smile in your face 
 But still in all backstabbers 
 (Chorus Lyfe Jennings) 
 I'm just trying to get on 
 Leave a couple mil to my kids when I'm gone 
 And nigga that ain't cologne 
 It's the smell of this money 
 I'm just trying to get home 
 'Cause I don't know when my karma gonna catch up 
 I don't know when the toilet gonna back up 
 And put me in some shit that I can't get out of 
 (Verse 2 Raekwon The Chef) 
 Come on 
 Bags of money 
 Trying to stay rich and fly 
 Keep it cool, silks and dungarees 
 Krug glasses and food 
 Grilled salmon, trying to make a move 
 Those who knowing they be dapping they dudes 
 How it do blow a lot of crews stay in the cut 
 Pacing from here to LA and Hawaii and Cuba 
 Blue new oozie too serial numbers is braille 
 So when you rub against it feel on (?) 
 Now I'm with some special niggas, next level niggas 
 With rubber bezels who drive Exeleros with jewels 
 (?) Boots on, olive goose, calamari soups 
 And noodles that spell out ""Y'all niggas the truth"" 
 What it is baby boy, reclining in a big Benz lazyboy 
 Endsed up, lenses on, Chips Ahoy 
 Shipping triple, niggas try to stop the issue 
 And cock-block but can't stop the official 
 (Chorus Lyfe Jennings) 
 I'm just trying to get on 
 Leave a couple mil to my kids when I'm gone 
 And nigga that ain't cologne 
 It's the smell of this money 
 I'm just trying to get home 
 'Cause I don't know when my karma gonna catch up 
 I don't know when the toilet gonna bck up 
 And put me in some shit that I can't get out of"
82,Raekwon,hiphop,We Will Rob You,"Who the hell teaches you kung fu? 
 Your master must be an ignorant idiot as well! 
 (Uncle Ricky, would you read us a bedtime story?) 
 Nah kid, but I'mma give you one them old Raekwon crime joints 
 Feel me? We will, we will... 
 We will, we will - here we go 
 Well it was late one night, walking through the park 
 With my leathered down coat and wallabee Clarks 
 Getting my step on, big shit, big six, big wrist 
 So much excitement in the air, I was crisp 
 Money suitcase, Louis joint (yo, Rae, I'mma get some shit just like yours!) 
 Go make it happen, black God and get rich 
 Saw the D's fly by, in a New Yorker, yup, tints and shit 
 They made a right on me, them last two dicks 
 Know I seen 'em, Max loaded, jog right back to the car 
 They spun around again and blast they shits 
 I dropped a Backwood, a puff and then a 6-4-5 
 You'se a live nigga, you almost smashed yo shit 
 I'mma don my way out the bitch, moving through the car 
 Nice and slow, two hoodies on and a golden pit 
 Nigga had a white eye, they both blacked down 
 What's the clown shit for? The dog jumped in the whip 
 It was a trained one, wops pointed at me (yo, nigga, freeze) 
 I told the Chef Raekwon, pump the breaks 
 Slow it down, you know these C-Cypher Punks scanned your plates 
 Release the seatbelt off the shoulders, a mile ahead 
 Then the vibe got a lot colder when the marksman said 
 ""Black niggas in the Jeep, get the fuck out the car"" 
 ""Put your hands where my eyes can see or suffer a scar"" 
 He was a veteran, who kept, pepper spray in the canister 
 Donut shop lounger, thirty eight brandisher 
 On top of that, the blunt smoke just rang a bell 
 Of his bloodhound who had an acute sense of smell 
 Beef tripping, saliva dripping from razor sharp teeth 
 That was pointy as the daggers of the Indian Chiefs 
 Same cops known for exorting pimps and booking whores 
 Aimed glocks at me and Rae, 'cause they was looking for 
 A few MC's wanted for a string of break-ins 
 Last seen, wearing long minks and snakeskins 
 We will, we will, rob you 
 We will, we will, glock you 
 We will, we will, what? who? (not you) 
 Here we go... 
 You know my Clan done ran from Japan to Atlanta 
 With stamina, peace to Chef, Mr. Meth 
 Move it on your left, with the Iron Lung breath 
 Ghostface Kill', U-G ill 
 Deck so real, Dr. Ason Unique, the medic 
 Ah, Allah Just, The Abbott, y'all niggas can't forget it 
 You might catch a Cap if your shit ain't Street 
 Allah Mathematics make the cypher complete 
 See knowledge is the foundation of existence 
 To know starts the spark of the flow 
 Wisdom activation of the Nation moving 
 Wise words, show and prove or understand the 13 letters 
 And the Masta, culture be the way of life 
 Freedom is reward, who will pay the price for the power 
 Spending hour after hour, preparing his self 
 For the hour, now look how refined 
 When the mind and body is one, every part of me 
 Supreme equality, manifest the nature of self 
 G-O-D, now build and add on to the truth 
 Destroy the bullshit, born incomplete"

 Crazy, let's go get 'em killa (Yo Dre, good looking on this coke, man) 
 (This shit is official) 
 Aiyo, it's back to business, making them diskettes, pushing sixes 
 Rocking wild animals on jackets are sickening 
 Hear me? From here to Rockaway to Cali, we flipped this 
 Broad day, Chef'll saute, his lyrics is crispy 
 Now I got Dre up in the kitchen, Rae stuck in position 
 Bout to flame broil his coke and get busy 
 What? Politics, pop collars and drive violent whips 
 Stay fly, hungry and wise, you know the code, honor it 
 Sit back, yelling it's nothing, unless his buttons get pressed 
 We don't stress nothing, we only get dressed 
 Stretched out, moving professional, frying more fish 
 I heard it in slurs, them niggas is blessed 
 While we ball to the maximum, give me the floor, for real 
 I show off and let my money get stretched 
 Take it to a new level, new bezzle, few rebels 
 Few wolves with medals on, you know we get test 
 Me, nigga, me, that's who, Cash Rule

 Yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah (yeah) 
 I'm here, so it's there, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah 
 Here comes the, a lethal presentation taking you places you never been 
 Deadlier than the combination of coke and heroin 
 I see the weakness in most of you niggas that be hollering 
 So I toned it down, so these words be piercing your lower obdomen 
 What I meant to say abdomen, keep on listening and following 
 While I'm ditecting a German, hateful niggas, chicks be swallowing 
 And if you look funny to me, and there's a problem then 
 I put you under an ultraviolet light or a halogen 
 As if I was busy deciphering counterfeit dollars and 
 Hoes in like some kind of Biblical figure, King Solomon 
 Hah, just for the record, what we do is essential 
 While I captivate the masses and keep the moments eventful 
 Doc Dre, Bust, Shallah Rae, see the vision? 
 Most you niggas still in disbelief, just came into fruition now 
 Pop the cork up off this bottle and you pour it 
 So euphoric, document this moment, shit is so historic 
 King of kings spit blood, all on my apron 
 Wash a nigga face with the mack, smoke 'em like Steak-umm's 
 Yeah my dynasty's brolic for real, we hunt E, catch the rat 
 Blow his waist, float in the stream 
 You know we all-pro with it, anti auto-tune 
 Boom, my flow fire, sit by the stove, hit it 
 Real niggas, official as listeners, gangstas and visitors 
 Step in the shit, we all prisoners 
 Might take the hammer from you, know I'm the animal 
 Rock a spur fur hat, no niggas in sandals, boo 
 Everyday get money and dress rugged, these are the times 
 Keep a nine on you, blow off in public 
 And I will surely feed my niggas the streets 
 Cop the hottest things to get, and haters they can eat and then preach 
 And while it go down, worldwide, this the team, this the theme 
 Me, Dre, Rhymes, my money makers is mean, what?"

 (Word, them blue ninjas is everywhere 
 Word, watch ya back, Protect Ya Neck and all that shit, man 
 Thirty nine motherfuckers already got scooped up 
 Indicted, word, I'm bird eye viewing it right now 
 Out there out the motherfucking window) 
 You got the strong scoopers out there? 
 (Word, five book store buses out front 
 All them young boys are certified, they our rentals) 
 (Chorus 2X: Suga Bang Bang) 
 For these mean streets from Cali to New York 
 Who could ya trust? Niggaz they do talk 
 Running from the feds and out of state troopers 
 Look up ahead, you know we got sharp shooters 
 (Raekwon) 
 The blocks is molded, step up ya sword piece 
 Moving through them housing with more ki's 
 Rembrandts is fresh from Scotland, crisp hats, Cristal bottles 
 Niggaz want the problems, we back 
 It's time to take over the game, it's nothing 
 I live on the line, from corner to castles with pawns and capsules 
 Scramble and find, my money's up, I'm praying for war 
 I do this all the time, all the time, all the time 
 Faces of Doom, sling in the lobby 
 Swinging cooked raw, if you played the field you was not leaving 
 Fast pace of a CREAM chasing team 
 Trying to come through the hood and lie, get left for dead naked in Queens 
 Let them other niggaz wear that, we take the credit 
 While we was shopping for more Nikes and off-whites 
 Heroin stirrers, the crib, cracked mirrors 
 Career thugs who serve only judges and jurors 
 Got to make my money this year, whether it's through rhyming or criming 
 I'll be on the line with my iron 
 Promised them llamas'll fly fast, quick at pirahnas 
 Trying to intervene, get caught dead, no head in pijamas 
 You live like a slouch from vouchers 
 Nobody mad, you was a fake, dead, die with no trousers 
 Cause you crossed the line like Miller's Crossing 
 Off with ya dome, I walked you through the woods, we both smoked a bone 
 (Inspectah Deck) 
 Mean streets... 
 Just when I thought I was out, they pulled me back in 
 The streets stay flooded with crack rocks and Mac shots 
 The scenery's money, guerrillas in the back drop 
 The livest'll pop, the weakest get chopped where they stand 
 Singing the judge's name, dropped in the stand 
 Drug money kills, blood on my bills, mud on my Nikes 
 Only buying with the couple that I trust with my life 
 Twenty four sev' ducking the feds, infrared with lead 
 Gamble with off track betting instead 
 In my hood anybody can get it, and everybody want it 
 Cutthroat executives, the corners, the office 
 And the thought is to be boss of all bosses 
 The cost is ya life, swimming with sharks and orcas 
 So keep ya guards up, or get scarred up 
 It's a Cold World, I told you with Allah Just' 
 The bigger the funds, the bigger the guns that's blazing 
 It's sick in the slums and niggaz are stunting for nathin' 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Aiyo, my gun been in more niggaz mouths than a whore had dick 
 With creamy nuts on the side of her jaw 
 It's Rigatone, nigga, sliding through airports 
 Riding on niggaz like MJ, same day I rocked you, comprende? 
 Yeah, I'm kinda off 'cause my guns was dirty 
 That last joint that hit you, kid, you made the top thirty 
 Early, walk with me and strap with a vengeance 
 More or less Ghostface Killah'll stretch you out like mad words in a sentence 
 Smell the gas burning (yeah) feel the fire (word) 
 Real talk, it's not that bullshit from The Wire 
 It's them disco kids that clap iron 
 Champion hoods, if ya coke don't freeze, my face is not worth frying 
 We crack eightballs with pool sticks 
 Bungee jump off a mountain of bricks 
 Fuck you up if you slinging those nicks 
 Toney Starks from the octagon, my ox is on 
 Snap Matt Hughes' neck with my boxers on"

 Your head gon' fly off your shoulder for lying 
 And I'm a be in bed like holders 
 Blood from a horse on your spread, you tried to play me now 
 I'm coughing up, dough on your head, you just a baby 
 See me in the flick as a Rick, I had to maybe with me 
 All these niggas stay in the 90's, getting rich 
 Rick Ruler robe on with rings, walking to the throne 
 Fronting like I know I'm the king, I live alone though 
 Buying up, China's Beemers, taking it to Simon's in Medina 
 Only just to blind you and leave ya 
 These young boys is crafted with aim, I bought 'em all 
 Fly ranches, 'cause they all stand beside me with flames 
 Regardless, yo, to making the classic, you gon' witness some of the tactics 
 Some died, live in the action 
 A live general when he walk, if he died, then we slide 
 Ninety thou' in the coffin, and take the child 
 Black Jesus, check my walk, check my talk 
 Legend in the flesh and I rep New York 
 Crowned king, been down to bang, I'm House Gang 
 Knockout specialist, in and out the ring 
 Got dinner tables long as boats with old kitchens 
 And Wu-Tang logos splashed on all the dishes 
 You know how I speaks the truth, how I teach the youth 
 I'm an animal, I beast the booth 
 Been grinding, banging out for food to eat 
 Your boy still eating good, check my new physique 
 Since the world is mine, I'm a write my name on the clouds 
 So that ol' yee faithful, can praise it and bow 
 Now he's an old Mafia don, from back when 
 He managed to survive the game, ducking fame 
 It's how he maintained, the State of Grace, kept his lab laced 
 Ladies of a fine taste, kept his place guarded 
 While the young charted, found acquitted, all charges 
 And his heart loss and, marksmen take the contract 
 From the contact, waiting for the right event, it all made sense 
 He left no prints on the weapon, and he was blasting 
 Came home from prison stashing, still stacking 
 His whip still matching his kit, steel flashing 
 Hands quick, nice with his shit, three holy foods 
 Drops jewels, from a street corner level, young brother, I'm a rebel 
 Here to instruct private soldiers to buck arms 
 Y'all rap cats had your last win, toast the kings 
 It's Wu-Tang, it's our thing, kiss the ring"

 Toad style, hmmph 
 The Shaolin deliberately tried to use the Lord 
 To learn our Wu-Tang sword fighting 
 The Shaolin would never do that 
 Wouldn't you? 
 The Shaolin have always looked down on us 
 Are you afraid the Wu-Tang would become more famous than you? 
 You? 
 So you used your Shaolin poison 
 To set up my master and deliberately frame me 
 That's nonsense 
 It's not nonsense, I saw it myself 
 Nonsense 
 The Shaolin have nothing to fear from the Wu-Tang 
 But our sword fight 
 Yo, aiyo 
 Villagers, gangstas, pillagers, paintbrush 
 New whips, blue fifths, Louis Shallah, shit 
 Ostrich turtlenecks, the Chef already reps 
 Lean off the petty jets, we buy the very best 
 Outfits, powerful rich, pouncers, camel clips 
 One bump, two lumps, a shotgun, a new jumps 
 With flying bird, buying herb, new kick, designer birds 
 She on it, we up, let's re-up and free'd up 
 Jake's hate it, Rae made it, clientele, we gon' sell 
 You gon' starve, he gon' jail, night boots, swim with whales 
 Better snub, surgical leather gloves, never loved 
 We gon' kill, take it to the Hill, we forever real 
 Old records, old luggage, you ill with no budget 
 You shoot and we spray, kill off them old buzzards 
 We love it, can't stand it, you read, the Wu Manual 
 We found it, stay grounded, we will, we still scrambling 
 Hey, hey, hold your fire, stop 
 You two traitors, you've mixed the Shaolin and Wu-Tang 
 No, we have not, it's just that they're the same 
 That's right, my Lord, you misunderstand our Kung-Fu work 
 It doesn't belong to anybody, it evolves 
 Kill 'em 
 The wrist lifter, the grave sitter, baby sitter 
 The jaw twister, open the vault, call your sister 
 Pyrex her up in the file, live as Twister 
 Blunt rolling, only a robe on, some whiskers 
 Knee slapper, the gat packer, black jacker 
 Extortionist, friendly as shit, Bob and Back-lur 
 Ones folder over the stove, gold rover 
 The gear dresser, the chop bagger, Marvin Haggler 
 Rap stabber, eat you alive, gold tarantula 
 Sixteen paces and blow, hold the heckler

 He threw a sword right through his wool shit

 (Intro: Raekwon) 
 Back to that fly shit, Silicone Valley good shit, right here, boy 
 More money on this rhyme right here, boy 
 Take y'all back to the front of the muthafucking 1-6-Ooh shit 
 Yo, lord, that first Wu shit 
 You know what it is, it's that muthafucking 
 Special made, high powered, special made forces 
 What up what up what up, aiyo, aiyo 
 Raekwon: 
 Chef that fly with a meat cleaver, swing on a young nigga 
 Smack flames at him, no gun neither 
 Leave him with a bump, what the fuck 
 (""They say he's a swordsman"") Get that little, nigga 
 Who give a fuck if he's a swordsman, I'm a gunman, I run from nothing 
 Chain came from rent days and pumping 
 Wire cell with valors on, drawers is colorful 
 I do this, forever nigga, raw style 
 Lighting Phillies, fly by willies, can't come through 
 Unless your vehicle three hundred chain, silly 
 Laying in the park with the killas, the coupes, the villains 
 No rims, we just ball for the millions 
 The emperor of slang lords, kings get clapped in they dome 
 Get your throne rushed, and I ain't got a gun on 
 High power ninjas who touch you, lay a gun on 
 Drinking with the best of the hustling 
 (Chorus: Raekwon) 
 I got butter knives, like you got butter knives 
 Come through huddling, run through the spot thirty times 
 All my niggas old school robbers, do what it do 
 I got a sixty-two, a black pair of goggles 
 Fila approachers, the Bee Hives, the vultures and the roasters 
 Can't come through with cedar toasters 
 It's going down, only in the town 
 Your heart get tested, and gunplay is only an investment 
 Raekwon: 
 Flying shooters, eyewear rugers 
 Stars and swords in front of the building, five thousand students 
 Cocaine cops they know him (""They say he's a swordsman"") 
 You already know that, man 
 Diamoned up, double O sevens, come through, 1-8-7 
 Back to the Hill in a second, yeah 
 Sons jump in front of them bullets, push me up in the bullet 
 Stay cool, I got shit, where ya weapon? 
 Hurricane slammers, earthquake clips and cannons 
 Back of the building, with the jammers 
 Live well, eat well, welcome to the Terror-dome, sleep well 
 Who don't like beefing? Keep shells 
 I flow with the souls of sharks and criminals in they heart 
 Play parts of this in detail 
 Well carried mannered, blampers, ninjas black down 
 Pop up on spots and vanished (""They say he's a swordsman"") 
 (Chorus: Raekwon) 
 I got butter knives, like you got butter knives 
 Come through huddling, run through the spot thirty times 
 All my niggas old school robbers, do what it do 
 I got a sixty-two, a black pair of goggles 
 Fila approachers, the Bee Hives, the vultures and the roasters 
 Can't come through with cedar toasters 
 It's going down, only in the town 
 Your heart get tested, and gunplay is only an investment 
 (Outro: Raekwon (kung-fu sample)) 
 Get down, Lord!

91,Raekwon,hiphop,Snake Pond,"Kung-fu sample: 
 Very good! 
 Who are you? 
 We are from the Wu-Tang 
 Shaolin's the foundation 
 From which all kung-fu springs 
 Buddha's name be praised 
 Raekwon: 
 I met him by Snake Pond, my hand on the flamer, my bomb 
 I park, Rae, Ghost, then lit up the bong 
 It's nightfall, nothing here, nothing to fear 
 Just got things to touch on, then he walked up weird 
 Walked in frail as stale, his eyes were soft 
 His face was pale, I looked at him kneel 
 Just wanna talk, you a deer, starting chasing him 
 He jumped in the tree, had grass in his ear 
 I'm a kill you nigga, you gonna have to come down 
 Little did he know I was a leader, a full bred eater 
 Jump in new V's, shopping, had the fever 
 Next stop Starbucks and Spiegels, Jags had diesel 
 Then she walked in, fly little diva 
 Niggas on the scheme for you gleam, they come from your school 
 A bunch of snake bites, they bitch smacked Shareen 
 She slid in the '09 Beemer, with that sex whore Sabrina 
 Fortune checks, live in Medina 
 Thanks for the info, my kinfolk, listen, Ms. Window 
 With the big pimple on her temple 
 Any more knowledge is college, you gave enough to be bounced now 
 She shot up in Chipotle, don't quote me 
 917, 646, you know it's war, bitch, 
 Can't dress for nothing, she fronting 
 Took a piss, roll up, let's twist, pulled down my pants 
 Good look, and shot through her tits 
 Now I gotta picture who I'm looking for, fake ass Brooklyn boy 
 I know his fucking family, fuck 'em all 
 I used to love brothers, now I hate 'em 
 Mostly them gator boys, who stunting and they never seen Nathan 
 Me and my real soldiers who started it, won't play part of it 
 But I'm a get to the bottom, I got 'em 
 Newspapers saying they shot 'em, but on the low 
 I heard he shot himself 
 A trip, yo, the poison me, I come from the poison peas 
 Where mothers run old nightclubs with tons of ki 
 Old lady holding them G's, dope fiends, holes in they jeans 
 Magicians that can make blow green 
 I know his whole team, no craze, dough so low 
 I hit 'em off mean, now he wanna hold me, no bro, B"
92,Raekwon,hiphop,Crane Style,"(Intro: Raekwon) 
 Come on, man, you a wild dude, Chef 
 Talk to them niggas, man, stop playing, man 
 For real, man 
 Raekwon: 
 Redskin leather, Indian sex 
 Pair of fresh Mocs on, lighting Lear on my flesh 
 Let my arm roll, fresh off the honor roll, platinum bottles of Cru' 
 All my niggas do what I got 'em for 
 Extra flashy grind, hit 'em with a crisp rhyme 
 Lines is nothing, blunt out, fuck him 
 All we know is jewelry and I mashed that, everybody excited 
 To see whatever bling on, smash that 
 Clever, more like a fox and ox together 
 Two stainless glocks, rocks and a feather 
 Yeah, I'm from the lead era, shoot at 
 Anything that move, and move out America 
 And all we ever want is needed, seen it 
 Like a young Filipino in Kuwait getting treated 
 Heavy horror armor, spike a bitch like her 
 Half a pound of good weed, then float through Gowanus 
 Brilliant master, sixteenth chapel in the Apple 
 Flooded up, Warridge wackos 
 Park Hillians getting hillions, that means millions 
 All on feet like Nigerian 
 Busta Rhymes: 
 Shallah, I got 'em 
 Heat-seeking missile spit, don't even try to hide, nigga 
 Sizzle through your skin bars, call me cyanide, bitch 
 Try me if you want, homey, violation's a no-no 
 I am the health hazard, skull and bone, poisonous logo 
 Unleash the dragon, massacre the scene 
 I'm spitting, burn a hole through the speaker, 
 And start melting the street up 
 Somebody please call the fire department 
 And I'm a strong believer, 
 Y'all know that I ain't the one to start with 
 Cause once the fuse is lit and we strike a match and the spark smell 
 My fangs bleed and we nam them up like ox tail 
 Y'all see what's happening, y'all know what the truth is 
 Somebody please ask Shallah Rae why he making me do this 
 Cause once I finish dudes, it's unfortunate for them yappers 
 Throw them in the trash, they ain't no recycling bin for rappers 
 I microphone control, it's the current dominant factor 
 The records been bodied, I personally request the pastor, gone"
93,Raekwon,hiphop,Rock N Roll,"(Chorus - Kobe) 
 Hey little mama, little mama, I got some of that Bon Jovi 
 You know me 
 Have you flying in the air like you living on the pent house 
 We on the corner serving that rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll 
 Posted on the corner with that rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll 
 (Verse 1 - Raekwon) 
 Willy Nelson nigga, you run flush, the crocodile hat 
 Cowboy rap, hammer game trustee 
 Diamonds on from Ghana, Boca Ratona, yeah 
 With the middle name Lex, pop my llama 
 Movies get made in HD, Mick and Jay they so three 
 I'm a Scarface to scrape me 
 There's nothing you could do to my real niggas 
 Not the ones I rest my head with, my sons'll milk a piranha 
 Two wheel scooters, the new Rugers 
 Floating through the Beverly summer 
 Counting ten with my shooter 
 All of these is high power, bard dealing style my nigga 
 Posted up, then fronting to Mr. Child 
 Titanium hustler, switch color 
 Most of them rich brothers'll hold they own 
 Fuck it, and switch numbers 
 Loved just the real shit, who killed shit? 
 Niggas is nothing, blow a blunt, repeal shit 
 (Bridge - Kobe) 
 Hey little mama, have you ever took a hit of Mick Jagger? 
 Yeah, better we'll blast you 
 Now take a hit of this rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll 
 It's some powerful shit 
 (Verse 2 - Ghostface Killah) 
 Everything platinum, even my baggage 
 You want a platinum rock? Then go see Ladin 
 He got the yellow hat, yellow Max Airs 
 Looking like me, with a yellow back, pretty long hair 
 Suck a dick like a rich stepping 
 Or Bobby Brown on speed dial, his ex girl stay on the check 
 I got that Mickey baby! 
 Little mama, I got the bomb, call me Tom Brady! 
 Move like a running back, 21 Tomlinson 
 Know how to push a pack, you should pay homage 
 Shit is too old, nigga feel like rhyming it 
 Get black, white, Mexicans 
 Make me fly like Donovan 
 Pop the champagne for the illest hustler in the game 
 I got the Pink Floyd, Ozzy all day 
 I ain't even mention my deals nigga 
 Because I don't want to have you freaked out over this real shit 
 (Verse 3 - Jim Jones) 
 Rockstar like the Red Hot Chili Peppers 
 I can't front because Roy Drop got me feeling extra 
 I drop the top so I can show style 
 I got the sours on Rolling Stone 
 I'm dropping shit on my mobile phone 
 I never slip because I keep a fully loaded chrome 
 And half my niggas even stay at that 
 Before we pour liquor for the 'grateful dead' 
 And where I'm from it's even Guns 'N' Roses 
 And fuck with me you need a bunch of roses 
 And Lord knows I keep the Led Zeppelin 
 A nigga front and then we bag wrestle 
 And you can tell them bitches feel at ease 
 We got that white girl, nigga Cheryl E 
 Diplomats, we the eagles 
 We finna be grated into Beetles"

 Because they come from THE power 
 Nas: 
 Rare nigga, I'm a wonder, your best success is my worst blunder 
 Feds tapped the number 
 Jury Jacqueline Onassis could appreciate 
 Weed to alleviate the pain, Eddie Kane, Richard Pryor, pinky ring 
 Watch ya conduct nigga, full pardons for my niggaz that's livin' 
 You guessed it, models, y'all keep 'em if they anorexic 
 Love 'em but can't trust 'em 
 Hate 'em but won't bust 'em 
 Cake in the savings, spinning wisdom it's like a custom 
 Tats of Hieroglyphics, lipstick on the collar 
 I got more to lose than you do, but I'm a rider 
 When did the rules change? Y'all livin' trendy on pennies 
 Meetin' deadlines with ease, no gain 
 You fire, I'm butane, gave the Timbs ostrich belts 
 These are the times that I surprise myself 
 My niggaz lookin' like Black Crowes at packed shows 
 The don voice stay pristine like I'm still 17 
 Raekwon: 
 I'm rick, black, African, rockin' a golden mack 
 Trailing leather Gucci leggings on my back 
 Willied by some hoodlum in the trench 
 Rinse these niggaz, 86 gazelles, dicing their defense 
 Mike Tyson disciple, trifle with my pen, it's a rifle 
 16 ways to shoot you through your Chrysler duke 
 Exhalin' with niggaz the jails argue 
 Bring the best niggaz to the table, I'll sick 4 of my whales on you 
 Custom wooded speakers rock Elise's 
 Run from polices, dump on creatures, holidays with preachers 
 Stainless Steel watches ostrich turtlenecks, Here's the deal 
 If we can't come in, they can't have the field 
 Bones ya Sisco, murder instrumentals 
 Kanye porsche rap, how many horses live official? 
 I run with generals that flash Uzis in interviews 
 My shit is deep we fly swimming dude 
 Nas: 
 Verse 2 gotta be all murder just like the first verse 
 Timbs yellow like the hair on a Malibu surfer 
 Yellow like my Harry Winston glistenin' arm B 
 Yellow like New York City piss stained concrete 
 Raekwon: 
 That's right yo, who voted toastin' in the wind? 
 Las Vegas odors, what you know 
 Leave it right here, we go to the Lotus 
 Put a package on your head, be promoted 
 Keys in effect, paying these dumb fuckin' D's offa donuts 
 Sample: 
 I hate to see you acting like a slave 
 To get an advance here an advance there 
 Because somebody else controls your destiny. 
 Raekwon: 
 I'm rich, black, umbrella calico captain

 Eatin chow lo mein with chopsticks, Glocks with aim 
 Watermelon chips, pop some pain

 Whether in hallways or boats, now feel us kid

 To fulfill the prophecy of the Wu-Tang, of the Wu-Tang 
 (Verse 1: Raekwon) 
 In the Polo store, fronting in war clothes, it been like this 
 From right in time when I was nine years old 
 I was a hot mess, smoking cheeba, running with stolen speakers 
 Dropped beepers, even wore a victory vest 
 I run with niggas, digging knots from niggas, running out the school 
 Stunting, back of the bus, flashing the ox 
 Rock the V-Gooses, everything we wore was name brand 
 Sold three looseys, just to get on call plan 
 R.E.C. Poss' Rockers, the Blip Brothers 
 Even the Spin Doctors, sat and smoke blunts, I been bopping 
 All my kins blew up, we grew up with 
 We used to do what? Running through the sewers and then shopping 
 Pick pocket, deuce baby, take it in truce, baby 
 You know how we do, come run in my boots, baby 
 The niggas came through, touch the God, here Shallah 
 Ever since went from ninjas to gem stars, sing Ra

 That reckless eyeballing will get your girl indicted 
 My touch like Midas, I cramp your style, arthritis

 Your man don't snooze, insomniac 
 This The W, the Clan don't lose, you putting hands on who? 
 Hands down, I can handle you, you half man, half animals 
 If you are what you eat, and eat pussy, you's a cannibal 
 And stopping me, is what you cannot do 
 Either get in the game, get out the way, or get ran right through 
 I ain't different Method Man like you 
 But you ain't like us, we play rough, my community tough 
 And little kids in my community cuss 
 Y'all be showing your guns, but the ones in my community bust 
 And when they do, you give the jewelry up

 Raekwon: 
 That nigga pussy doin' pig Latin 
 He can't come to the hood 
 Might kill him off top up in the Staten 
 Son think he better than niggaz 
 I think his rebels is resentful 
 Tried to kill him in his rental 
 He had an Idi Amin approach 
 Hittin the roach, had a hunger face 
 He drove his mom's 7 in the ocean 
 He's a wild cowboy slangin' heron 
 Who rock a dead arm 
 Knock a DEA agent out his Chevron 
 All of his Eli's machette'd up stainless 
 (Sample) 
 Never heard nothing, all you hear is the guns bangin' 
 Rockin' pastel blazers with a shorty from Iceland 
 Who old dad put 'em up on white sand 
 Starving to make a wack debut he came through the lobby 
 Three culture Devilles with him, a whitey 
 This pathetic, braggin' monkey face faggot deaded 
 Comin' through the stairs with blow in his mouth, desperate 
 Watchin' him lookin' stupid, son know we on foot patrol 
 Come through the hole, niggaz is swoopin' 
 700 shots, all leather gloves, 6 thugs 
 Two had a mask on, they took 'em off what 
 We got you now nigga knowin' you down 
 Niggaz is foul, this is trauma king, by any means baow 
 They pushed his face in, fell out his Saconies 
 Snatched his homeys, took his Glock 
 You gonna be my Tenderonies? 
 Lloyd Banks: 
 Metal exchanges, the hoods a gun range 
 Everybody's a target, depending on how you aim 
 Dice games and ice chains, pennants spellin' your name 
 OG's settin' the wrong example, tellin' the same 
 Look at Shorty Shit Stain, grew up to be a fuckin' mess 
 Before his clique came 
 He banged and never tucked his chest 
 Project full of them thangs he caught the gun connect 
 Ridin' round with A and Lou, Nino when they want respect 
 Son cold, Nino want to show 
 Everybody know they straight shippin' hood bitches to the bungalow 
 Pillow talking led to birds talking 
 Chattin' bout what happened and when and where they comin' back in 
 Champagne slackin' traffickin' while they travel 
 Word got back at old time friends and snakes rattled 
 Two different 'burbans but the one that dropped the birds got tailed 
 Information for the ones who light the steel got mill. 
 Pussy power made the plans sour 
 Apartment full of party powder outside a stakeout for hours 
 Click clacks from big gats and rags 
 Soon as the door squeaks they runnin' up on the grass 
 BANG FLASH shots right on path, broken glass 
 Comedy of laughs while they haul ass with the bags 
 Legends in my hood play back 
 Twin Benz's whippin' in black 
 And that was like the old Maybach"

 Convertible roof, hard headed, angry amber 
 If I'm pitching, giving bricks out to baby Rambo 
 I'm on Rodeo with yae yo, fifty baby hammers 
 The new shits that blow a building up, crazy damage 
 If it's priors, I do my own dirt, spray the cameras 
 So many soldiers, no soft niggas in the slammers 
 We run wild like 'lo gazelles and baby pandas 
 Small nigga with his gun rum, crazy gamblers 
 I'm uptown fronting, the fans know what gave me grammers

 Your president of your country, yelling 'big dummy' 
 Chef a fly ass nigga, he cook every Sunday 
 He had a beef on the runway, making shit ugly 
 I had on alligators clarks, camouflage rugby 
 Bad bitch from Brazil, who fuck, never suck me 
 We was cooling in the Trump section, throwing bubbly 
 Got my niggas with the guns out, bowling lovely

 Palestinian armor, golden rocket launcher, my aunt 
 She copped it from me, bought it in Rwanda 
 See demons scheming, niggas get live in the Beacon 
 I'm 'shaw' to 'shank' shit up like Morgan Freeman 
 Pussy getting rapper, rich nigga, one-on-one rents niggas 
 And incidents, my fingerprints been tore up 
 We sell love slinging like Siemens, the snortable Beemers 
 They love calling niggas names out, you screaming 
 Feds try to tap us and plus clap us, niggas'll grab Bust' 
 Throw you in the rassle, yo, clap ups 
 Catch me at the Stephen King mansion, with four of my Branson niggas 
 With me, me and Britney, a dancer 
 Know your shit authentic by the way your hat fit on you, with it 
 I'm like the Blair Witch nigga in the rented 
 Curtains in the five-seven, chunky and short 
 Bagging dope up in the backseat, your packages walk 
 Holding my girl wedding ring, she Medellin

 Flow freely this is all graffiti, the cloth I'm cut from 
 Is straight from a rich nigga genie

 Still gritty, leave the pretty to the females 
 The watch mother pearl weather seashells 
 Pick of the litter, have this nigga picking paper up

 Get 'em up, banging dangerous as angel dust 
 Cuban Linx smoking stink in the Brink's trunk

 Ankle monitors under garments, so fuck showers

 Yo, we in the back roasting marshmallows, bottles of Cru' 
 The dialogue is the big chain niggas is rude 
 Law library scholars, potatoes over the thirty eights 
 With bald-heads, all live wires 
 Eleven homes, six trust funds, came home from doing a dime 
 We just left Un's, straight up 
 And we standing over the stoves, in denim Gibaud's 
 Bought a Dairy Queen in Queens right next to Lowe's 
 IMAX Theaters, Astoria Waldorf 
 Philip Drummer suite, pretty young thing sucking my balls off 
 Bubble baths, hash, zooted up, eyes closed 
 Silk drawers, fronting in my key lime pie Wall-o's 
 And I still got a half a key indeed, Frank Lucas shit 
 Hidden in coffins, flying over seas 
 And if you ever try to ruin my night 
 I'm a make sure my best pawn put like three in your kite 
 Shot caller, laying in big laws 
 Rock of Gibraltar, my pinky joint, killer like Orca 
 Daytime hawk, a nasty street author 
 Me, Rae and Rick, Uzi'd out in the Porsche's 
 Case we gotta Warner bro, like Malcolm-Jamal

 'Cause I can hut-one, hut-two, disrespect, I hunt you down 
 Ain't a muthafuckin' crew we can't run through 
 (Chorus x2: Raekwon) 
 Yo, Scarface gangstas, criminal niggas up in the trenches 
 Army coats on, playing the benches 
 Getting paper, sly, that's the motto, intelligent goons 
 Inside a hundred thousand dollar whip, follow

 You know what it is, man

100,Raekwon,hiphop,The Scroll,"Yeah, word, I heard about it, man 
 Yeah, word, similar story, you know? 
 Raekwon: 
 Regardless, we all ninjas, and got money, 
 But the theme of the story 
 Is yo, checking how they came for me 
 (This is it, B) 
 Kinda brief from the gold teeth era, 
 Bro dreaming on C.R.E.A.M. 
 Complimentaries and beef 
 I'm from the wild side, a militant was made by the foremost elite 
 It sound good, brung my rifle shit, clean 
 Met the others, lit a blunt, begin 
 I'm like Nicole Kidman in the wind, niggas is wild, niggas is eat 
 Then I chanced it, blood can always beat mud 
 Mud is part of being thug, I guess it's advance, we from the street 
 This is me, I'm ready to beat, whatever, we gon' off' it 
 One time alone, yo, they pricked up Unique 
 Meth standing there, rare hustler hair, right in front of the building 
 Them niggas do them killings out there 
 This is deep, me, Rebel, U-G, he walked in the room 
 Scarf rap, pair of Timberlands, beat 
 This the potion, roll the scroll out, speaked and another walked in 
 Knowing now this is a thief 
 We from the same voc's, this is like a pot roast 
 Hottest niggas who rhyme, I know them from the time, 
 This is not 'posed to happen 
 Peace Black, we wasn't cool 
 Threw the piece back, everything good, I lit the leaf, captain 
 Got a mission, to make sure the world recognize our position 
 I'm standing near the kitchen 
 Shit just might work, I lit the stink, this could be the realest shit 
 This could be the realest flip quick 
 Everybody stand up in militant, army jackets down 
 I said to myself, this the realest clique 
 True champ, we gon' rep it through, keep it cool 
 No boot camp, no hard work, just some loot, family 
 All in, ball till you fall, loyal as ever 
 I grab my leather, I'm a lay till you call 
 (Chorus x3: Raekwon) 
 Generals, demons, nighttime, vultures 
 Caught up on the ropes, let's team it 
 Everybody seen it, Zenith, what you mean? 
 Everybody C.R.E.A.M.'in', the all American dream"
101,Raekwon,hiphop,Masters Of Our Fate,"(Sample: Winston Churchill) 
 Now we are the masters of our fate 
 That the task which has been set us is not above our strength 
 That it's pangs and toils are not beyond our endurance 
 As long as we have faith in our cause and an unconquerable will-power 
 Salvation will not be denied us 
 Salvation will not be denied us 
 Salvation will not be denied us 
 We are the masters of our fate 
 Long as we have faith, an unconquerable will-power 
 Salvation will not be denied us 
 (Verse 1: Raekwon) 
 The time has come, I've just begun, this is designer rum 
 My wallet got flowers on it, kill it cowards 
 From the land, the stolen land, where gold chains control a man 
 Three hundred holding hands, stolen grams 
 I play the phantom, waving, 
 Leave that nigga for dead, or should I save him 
 Spitting out phlegm, no, just grave them 
 I remember days, I used work for niggas, eat jerk with niggas 
 Buying whip, is laughing and joking, trying to flip 
 Clip is loyal, fly spoil on the block, display royal 
 Even though we go back to royals, black oils 
 Live as ever, can't tell me nothing, whatever 
 This thing of ours, is empowered by my niggas who pumping 
 Twenty four hours of slang motion, wave brush 
 Ya knew my hair was the ocean, running through the building 
 Just negation, some of the creeps 
 Knew me very well, knew he would sell, knew he was potent 
 Sample: 
 Now we are the masters of our fate 
 That the task which has been set us is not above our strength 
 That it's pangs and toils are not beyond our endurance 
 As long as we have faith in our cause and an unconquerable will-power 
 Salvation will not be denied us 
 (Verse 2: Black Thought) 
 OK, bridges I burn some, lessons I learn some 
 Money, I spent some, lent some, earn some 
 My eyes tell it, tell her the hell I return from 
 Spark up an L from the homeys I haven't heard from 
 Burn when the herbs come, I'm living large 
 Never chilling on the curb, just a villain on the verge, son 
 My tenth shot is as efficient as the third one 
 Second one, first one, worse come to worse run 
 When I was pushed out the womb, the Earth spun 
 The only way to describe this is inertia 
 Some rappers think they can try me, who the first up? 
 I don't guarantee no survivors, niggas, surf's up 
 Yeah, soul on ice, courage is sacrifice 
 Hold on tight, and save your laughter for the afterlife 
 These chumps thinking they good, ain't even half as nice 
 Your fate'll be a one way ticket to paradise, what? 
 Sample: 
 Now we are the masters of our fate 
 That the task which has been set us is not above our strength 
 That it's pangs and toils are not beyond our endurance 
 As long as we have faith in our cause and an unconquerable will-power 
 Salvation will not be denied us 
 Salvation will not be denied us

103,Raekwon,hiphop,Wu Crime,"(GZA) 
 Yo, there's a rumor, that an inmate heard 
 Salesman hiring, a convict of murder 
 Bodyguard, who used to do physical fitness 
 His business, is catching to terrifying the witness 
 In the gym is where he gained his powers 
 Boss was the pizzeria owner that rolled flower 
 A made man, felt good to be made 
 Turned murderer, extremely quick to upgrade 
 But he still baked pies, and his cake would rise 
 Like his enemy, he watched to take dives 
 Allies, would retaliate the least 
 Even the score, had a thousand guns, they would calibrate 
 He sort of loss and double crossed, moved on them 
 Swiftly, if worlds away, sit and shuttle off 
 Horror in the 'Ville, without the Amity 
 Scars upon the grill of your friends family 
 Workers utilized and brutalized 
 Informats scrutinized and crucified 
 Wakes firebombed, functions shot up 
 The jakes was not alarmed to damage the product 
 (Raekwon) 
 Shoot his man's, grizzly stance, up in the GT, Clansman 
 With the sword that'll blow up a van 
 When them peoples come, blow right past, mind your business 
 I don't know nothing, they found his ho in the trash 
 Barbeque wings, blings for my niggas that's true kings 
 Sit up in the crib, catch supper and screw fiends 
 Yeah, watching me, next time, scotch me 
 I drink Crystal liquor, I'm a version of Hitler 
 On wax, no 'dacks, just water, a doorag on 
 I scratch waves, saying 'niggas is trash' 
 Yo, learn how to write, beware, I pull up, he here 
 I should of known, I had a clone, see weird 
 Niggas'll get hurt, merked, dropped off in a new turf 
 Trunk full of Siamese rats and gnats, yo 
 I do it for the cats in pits, and all the bitches with big tits 
 Five hundred shoe game switch 
 Shake that shake, I bake, I live in estate 
 That kill niggas over grits and steak 
 You might get smacked with a mack eleven, or run off the road 
 Or shot in McDonald's for fronting with fake niggas 
 (Killah Priest) 
 Aiyo, Saladin, vivid Wall Street sixteen 
 Muslims, kufis, uzi's, the Wu is supreme 
 Ferociously, I rank general, a world's above self 
 Conspicious, crime make me grab the nine off the shelf 
 The dark hallways, amazingly convenient, the Phoenix with Jane 
 Juggling cracks or playing with ninas 
 The law of the streets, gangsta crave the beef to feast 
 Fiends with plates and snake wanna eat 
 Gazed at the spectacular rapper, niggas is Dracula 
 Rap tours, Priest the hood ambassador 
 Passion for war, Wu-Massacre, threats, they never worry me 
 Plots to my death, mic jack conspiracy 
 Lyrically, I'm only afraid of my own ability 
 Words that shape into nuclear wars, we shooting through walls 
 Bringing down the mall, I ring around the store 
 Planets of the Apes, bandanas on our face 
 Hammers on our waist, cameras out in space 
 The nickel plate, fake armor, will harm y'all snakes"

 Posing like a king, I'm rocking New Balances, new silencers 
 Glass table'll choke, twenty four challengers 
 Half of my niggas is slow, but they dough island 
 You know the pantries is full, ranches with bulls 
 And wolves there, who sit around, fronting in Wu-Wear 
 I slam a Noodles hat, pull hair, two tokes and Ghost 
 In a ghost, I be back in the wrong year 
 Long sleeve, one cuff up, rugged gold teeth 
 Fronting with Colombian niggas who gave me raw meat 
 Due to the gangstas that died, forever ride 
 To the rats in the manholes, who hate, niggas live

 Back in the Guess with the Champion hood, what?

 I'm dynamic rec room potent, that'll blow you in the open 
 Pay a cop off, fly you your coke in 
 My house is worth 2.9, my Benz is worth, he want mine 
 Nowheres, we call that shit high heels 
 Dedicated heat rock sprayer, spray your mother and your lover 
 Better pay up, these guns is from Grenada 
 Wild fight, customized dice, get nice in the Trump Tower 
 Drunk bitch, spaghetti and sliced

 But, now watch mine!

 Y'all niggas food, I peep that shit a long time ago 
 Dick rider niggas trying to front like they grimey, tho 
 This is my world, I just let you live in it 
 But the lease is up, you faggot niggas get evicted 
 How many times I gotta tell you cowards, mind your business 
 Oh, you still yapping? Time to catch 'em slipping 
 Doing dirty, we don't mind getting our hands dirty 
 And you can't fuck with any bitch because her ass dirty 
 'Cause when it pop off, we just up in shorty ears 
 And you just stuck with it, and how us niggas got you there 
 That little bad caramel with the long hair 
 Got you lined up, and caught in the crosshair 
 Nothing but bosses here, we enforced the fear 
 Always in the hood, my office there 
 Blow a bag with my comrades, polly my next move 
 And have you niggas bugging, how I wet 'em and crept through"

 Stop playin', start prayin', I just might start sprayin' 
 Niggas is ass and all day with it 
 No style with no pals, niggas is so foul 
 It shows how I only fuck with real, them niggas know now 
 I slow down, don't wanna catch a charge and go down 
 I'm too large, drop a bag, use a marksman 
 Pause, said, ""You don't want no parts of me, kid"" 
 I'm just shootin' you real rap, so go wash with it 
 A legend with his hands up, suits is glammed up 
 I'm just bowlin' for millions out in Japan, what 
 Plannin' somethin', niggas ride around wearin' somethin' 
 Other than that or rap, I'd rather fade black

 Inhale it (x3) 
 Weed so loud, all my neighbors say they hear it 
 Roll up the strong, inhale it (x3) 
 Weed so loud, all my neighbors say they hear it 
 (2 Chainz) 
 These niggas is dead already, I use machetes to eat spaghetti 
 They really couldn't ride a mile on my Pirellis 
 Bags so heavy the damns collapsed 
 Conversate about me, that's a chain reaction 
 Pressure to press in past aggression 
 Hope your body guard got pain protection 
 One in the chamber, middle finger, no fornicate 
 So many bullets in the clip, it's 'bout to sufficate 
 My uncle was late, my aunt ain't show up 
 How you gon' tell an old man to grow up 
 It's like comparin' Earl to throw up 
 Same frame of mind but a different poster 
 I'm 'posed to be what I wanna be 
 Dream so big for the world to see 
 First class, fruits and tea 
 And usually the only black man is me

 Inhale it (x3) 
 Weed so loud, all my neighbors say they hear it 
 Roll up the strong, inhale it (x3)

122,Raekwon,hiphop,Blind Threats,"Right, uh, uh same shit every day, homie 
 Lord please forgive me for all my sins 
 Yeah, nigga wake up to the same shit everyday, homie 
 Walk through the valley of the shadow of death 
 No rules, right 
 Washing my sins off in hell's water 
 Feel like the Bible told me lies as I pray to 'em 
 Kneel down, put my faith in 'em, will you answer me? 
 But if God won't help me, this gun will, I swear I'm gon' find my way 
 Uh, four corners, cat and mouse chase, got cheese to catch 
 High on on some drug, I'm Space Cadet 
 Dreaming I don't live up on the block no more 
 Trapping trying to make it out this obstacle 
 Life on the edge, hell a block away 
 Pretty Snow White turned eight today 
 Selling that base, no Dr. Dre 
 Uh, guess who in the building? 
 Bucket hat with a strap like the pilgrim uh 
 Kneeling down with some questions to address like 
 Why the ones who commit the worst sins live the best? 
 The 10 commandments, I can mark five checks 
 But I sense flaws, the Bible preaching blind threats 
 Streets held me down, got faith in a Pyrex 
 Faith in a four-five, I call it the clarinet 
 Sewer full of drugs when the toilet digests from the cop raid 
 All can relate, from the streets to the wall from niggas to compadres 
 When the sun go down, I'm predictin' a heatwave, forecast your whole body 
 Heat on, room full of homi's, I just pray that the Lord got me 
 Uh but if God don't help me, this gun will, I swear I'm gon' find my way 
 Mic check, mic check, mic check, (La la, la la, la low, la la, la la low) 
 But if God won't help me, this gun will, I swear I'm gon' find my way 
 Aim that, shoot that, pledge allegiance 
 Kill mine, kill yours, make it even 
 Soul need saving, Mr. Preacher 
 I know I only come around when it's Easter 
 Funerals, Thanksgiving, Christmas time 
 When I'm in jail or when my card declined 
 Uh, will you answer me? 
 Take me out of Hell and make plans for me? 
 Misery loves company, ain't a surprise 
 It was just me and my niggas, we was trying to survive 
 But we would never make it out alive 
 Shit we living to die, oxymoron 
 Hope to get to heaven 'til that day arrive 
 Running through the ally, hope the bullet don't collide 
 Car window shattered, glass on my right side 
 Dogs bark in the backyard, rootin' for me 
 Out of shape belly, courtesy of 40 
 Spoiled only child, baby boy Jody 
 Same jacket on from back in the day 
 Praying that the Lord come and take me away 
 Uh but if God don't help me, this gun will, I swear I'm gon' find my way 
 Mic check, mic check, mic check, (La la, la la, la low, la la, la la low) 
 But if God won't help me, this gun will, I swear I'm gon' find my way 
 Ey yo tuna fish sandwiches bread, dry snaking 
 Black Lincoln, burgundy Mac, I clap a king-pin 
 Caught me in the airport gust that I was thinkin' 
 On how to stay rich and get bills with my acquaintances 
 Yeah, money is the issue, I diss you 
 It's no problem at all, yo, the bunch on the pistol 
 'Cause I'm a suit case king 
 Cooling at the gambling spot with a screwed face grin 
 No wage bet, we stay winning, play it again, yo 
 Put the bone in your jaw, now say it again 
 Round knife, fork, under the tents, coming to rents 
 Get out the way or let the shotty dispense 
 Revenge killers who make the events iller 
 This is more realer, snatch you right up out of the Benz 
 The Wu wheelers who huddle up, coupes knows the truth 
 You know the woopty-woop, solo or group I kill niggas"

 Sometimes I'm slightly off my rocker, but I'm on deck 
 Got 2 and a baby off my bitches student loan check 
 She hit my line to get that girl, I call it phone sex 
 Robbing like my problems ain't gon catch up to me later 
 Bitch I'm mobbing like OG Bobby Johnson, split your potato 
 At the table, cooking, shaving and touching base with them basers 
 Bet they try to make a play for the yay' as soon as they taste it 
 The amazin' black American Gangster, sinister, corner her 
 'Cause seeing this nigga shine been annoying me like a muthafucka 
 This busta owe me, now he act like he don't know me 
 Forty fo' my closest homie, kill cockaroaches like Tony 
 Got Montana money 
 You bought 100, dipped in fluid, yo, I had to smoke it 
 Pupils dilated like silver dollars, now we know-cking 
 Call it devilish how I do bitch 
 Fuck these niggas talking, I leave they thoughts on my shoestrings 
 What? 
 Rolling 
 Pockets all swollen 
 Set the record straight, that FNH is what I'm holding 
 A busta that we know got 15 'bows, bust it open 
 We came bandana'd up, divide it up, now what's the quotient? 
 A split with 4 niggas, since I'm a go getter 
 I think these suckers pussy, I'ma merk the whole litter 
 Told my girl to leave as soon as I hung up the phone with her 
 Man, I heard you rob the robbers, look Freddie a cold nigga 
 Got an ice maker for a heart, made nigga from the start 
 Life is like a movie, all I did was play my fuckin' part 
 Cheffing up the crack, the heroin, and the weed a la carte 
 I call it Fast Freddie's, I should own a fuckin' restaurant 
 'Cause back when I was 12 threw some bells on a scale and I got a pager 
 We broke them down and started selling nickels to the neighbors 
 Eventually the penitentiary gon' see me later 
 Kiss my momma, told her if I die, then it was part of nature 
 What? 
 28 days later we all getting fresh 
 Got the heart to die for something, flesh to flesh 
 The Lambo, got her outside, it's a stretch 
 My bitch half Mexican/Afghan, I'm blessed 
 From living tough times with rough lemons, a gorgeous watch 
 My team on a dreadful level, yo 
 Yeah, we still getting money right 
 Long as the sun come out, I'll hold these twenties tight 
 Getting fresh, just cooling, my bitch on my dick 
 Ba boom yo, you live with your moms, just get a grip 
 Clip in my pocket, a rocket 
 I think of the Dips, I need Juelz and Jims, with rough licks 
 Trips to Africa, shorty tear Saks up 
 I'm out in Bombay, rebels here actin' up

 Pour me some Scotch and cold Courvesoir out. 
 No doubt, have a chair, Boo, let's get to prolly in. 
 Who you wit? Me and Molly, and some trick from Yugoslavia. 
 What fabric is that? It's only wool 'n' rayon. 
 Lipstick crayon, fly, Veer on ice, spray on. 
 I'm gettin' tipsy, I hope she read cocks like a gypsy, 
 And transport bricks, steal in many fifties.

 While my heart was racin', like the hands on the clock. 
 I step live, I think she see me puttin' out the pot. 
 Peace, Dot, I'm so happy to see you at the rendezvous. 
 How's life today? Your hands are softer than Camay, 
 Too, your hairdo - way more class than Halle Berry. 
 Caught visions of me and you ridin' on the ferry. 
 Plus your daughter, Kiki, talk to my man, Merry. 
 I order me a Sex on the Beach, with the cherry. 
 I order her a Vermidi on ice, sounds nice. 
 She elegant, pretty eyes, glasses, intelligent; 
 Whispered in my ear that she's celibate; 
 Whispered back to her ear: we don't have to go there. 
 As I grab the hand, set her politely in the chair. 
 As we stopped to stare at one another. 
 Black sister, the brother, 
 I'm thinkin' all the time how she could be my lover.

 Here have a seat, complementary drinks is on me. 
 Bartender Chevalier, chateaux at table three. 
 Luxurious rings, eyes sparkling. 
 What's your name, sugar? Juanita Cash Hawkins. 
 Your complexion gives a reflection of... 
 Sometime a black woman just need to be loved. 
 Quiet and shy, baby girl, my gift got you high. 
 Made you want to hit me with the keys to that file. 
 Just jokin', baby, I have a sharp sense of humor. 
 Wish I woulda bumped into your frame a lot sooner. 
 What's your physical degree, thirty one, thirty three? 
 Half Hawaiian, with a slight touch of Chinese. 
 Seen you workin' at a law firm, on Fifth Avenue; 
 Three blocks from the Gucci spot is where I trapped you. 
 Yo, I'm all into older women, who's happy livin'. 
 Love kids, and keep all up and this in the crib, and 
 Not afraid to doubt, need a God on your side. 
 We holdin' hands till death do us part, and then we slide. 
 Earring in the left side of your nose, love my combo. 
 Should have left wizard thousand times, maybe tonight though, 
 But you sexy mothafucka, damn, what's the recipe? 
 You make a nigga want to... God damn, 
 Can you cook darlin', at the stove you're revolvin'. 
 Bake macaroni, turkey wings, a nigga starvin'. 
 Here, take my number, let me pull the chair from under. 
 I had fun, plus your backyard speak with thunder.

 Spore plush I played my hand like a royal flush 
 Baggy jeans, wallabee clarks, pretty woman 
 I put it in him, shot up in him, deadly venom 
 I hung around the big time bosses 
 Illegal force exchange thoughts, showing love to all my sources 
 Spades tried to bag me, like cagney, and lacey 
 Chef had that bitch stacey slippin in macy's 
 I dose off, catch a flashback on how I got trapped 
 And got licked like papsy in a mob flick I got hit 
 Stumblin holdin' my neck to the god's rest 
 Opened flesh burgundy blood colored my guess 
 Emergency trauma, black teen headed for surgery 
 Can it be an out of state nigga tried to murder me? 
 I should've stayed in job corp, but now I'm a outlaw 
 Ray cartegna, carry a fo'-fo' nigga

 Mad 10's with mad diamonds 
 Now that's the life of the good life, sometimes niggaz act trife 
 I paid the price throughout my hood life 
 Remember I got blasted, now that's in the past kid 
 God forbid I lay in the casket 
 But now I'm all about g-notes, no time for weed, mixed with coke 
 I wash my mouth out with soap 
 And I got my act together, 'lo sweaters and better 
 And fat leather, so whatever, bring it on

 Something go wrong, we slug something 
 Chill my nigga, chill (I got this, I got this) 
 Make sure you handle that beat, you know what time it is 
 Body that beat, man, come on (Yeah) 
 You can catch me anywhere, frost bitten chain 
 Bad dame, a thousand grams in Delaware 
 The smoke shop's is owls, laid back, hanging niggas to death 
 Word, you can call us coat racks 
 With 'giants' all around me like, Eli Manning 
 The bitch is on the block like, he died scrambling 
 Cause L frames is crack, popped out, nina one of his eyes 
 Can't come back home, they locked out 
 All he did was re-up, hustle for kick money 
 Kept Beez all around him, thinking he shit honey 
 Bow, I'm into bobsleds, wasting large bread 
 Gucci helmet is blue, trim in his dark red 
 The rap TJ Swan, it's me Ason 
 If he don't spin my shit, break the DJ arm 
 And glide off like an escapade, renegade on ice 
 Lemonade Clark, the haze is nice 
 The Goldielocks, rocks sapphire, chain is right 
 Bitch niggas, y'all watch what y'all say in ya mics, suckas 
 Aiyo, Rae, aiyo, Rae, check it out, yo 
 Let me go in there one more time and air these niggas out 
 For old times sake, you know how we do, my nig' 
 Old times sake, just for me, man, one more time, I'm begging you 
 Let me just go in, and just fly on these niggas heads, man 
 It's what I'm talking about 
 It's like a body in a project hallway, who did it? 
 Who's the next nigga that sucked the snit-ich 
 That's my word, it could never be me 
 You see the deer head on the living room wall, like his neck fell off 
 That can be all sculptured and glazed with gloss 
 Call the shots that Bill Belichick would call 
 Snake niggas slither all in the glass house, racial slurs 
 When it's time to go to war, they cash out 
 Throw 'em in the rear-naked choke, they tap out 
 Niggas try to surround the kid, I backed out 
 And threw two rocks at 'em, watching the ho drop 
 I'm from a place where we locking the low glocks 
 Yellow tape, the bodies, jiggy and road blocks 
 Got the towels up in the air, it's so hot 
 Talking bout Staten Island, profiling 
 Switchblade city, the goons is wilding 
 Escape from my slums, nigga, you got talent 
 And we don't want the fifth of 'yac, we want the gallon 
 What you think I'm a fucking worm like you? 
 I told you, man 
 Vacate black, bust gats, wherever we at 
 You all that, hit 'em in the chest, we fall back 
 I got mines, nigga, where yours at? 
 We call that, raw rap, got fiends in front of my door mat 
 That Witty Unpredictable fly shit, drive-by shit 
 These the niggas I ride with 
 And we gon' get cake, y'all, as soon as this pie split 
 Smacking up the dry snitch, nigga, you my bitch 
 Somebody put Tical on, matter fact, put Tical on 
 One suuu, Staten Isle on 'em 
 I bank roll, I break codes, and I ain't trynna catch another case, case closed 
 Give me my crown, 'cause I deserve it, real dudes giving me pounds 
 But not too close though, the semis'll round 
 Bitches, running they mouth, goons, running your gate 
 My team running the block, cops running my plates 
 Well fuck that, Criminology rap 
 Niggas hate, I hate back, floating in the flyest Maybach, nigga"

 Singin' the intro, shakin' the ass like the nympho 
 Time to move, nigga, we in, time to catch wins

 For magical mixes, remix the hell outta the Bible 
 Like strip it and switch the whole title 
 Robes hit the floors, shoes is buffed 
 Gold studded bracelets, handcuffs, they gave it up

 Teach niggas how to resolve a big mob 
 Keep niggas on beat, fuck around and di-ie the mid-ob 
 Niggas gonna bump what, yeah, you wit it whatever 
 Let's body these niggas, a lot of niggas bump, yeah

 Yo, yo, never been the type to hold a grudge 
 Did five, I was guilty, fuck the judge 
 The Ave. got mad when I slid back through 
 Iced out, just came home and I blew 
 (Chip Banks) 
 We like, them frisky, rich and poet-esque 
 If it's chilly on our neck, then it's cold on our wrists 
 The cash flow is nuts, come through 8th Ave 
 Another hundred style, burn out for doughin' us 
 (Trife) 
 Aiyo, the hood's off the hook, hooded up crooks 
 Play the back burner wit black burners layin' for the juks 
 I'm too live, heats be the same as my shoe size 
 Fresh out the box, just copped a pair of new nines 
 (Killa Sin) 
 Yo, my team is like nitro, it might go boom when the lights blow 
 Catch you in the spinal wit the same knife from Psycho

130,Raekwon,hiphop,Daytona 500,"We are the G, O-D's 
 And we came to rock, the spot 
 Like Ironman Starks 
 They be the illest MC's, in the world today 
 Cappa Raekwon and the R-Z-A 
 So listen to them clear, and put the box right near your ear 
 Light your blunts and down your beers 
 Cause you could never fuck with Wu-Tang Killer Bees 
 (Raekwon the Chef) 
 Say peace to cats who rock mack knowledge 
 Knowledgists, street astrologists 
 Light up the mic God, knowledge this 
 Fly joints that carried your points 
 Corolla Motorola holder 
 Play it God, he pack over the shoulder 
 Chrome tanks, player like Yanks, check the franchise 
 Front on my guys, my enterprise splash many lives 
 Rapel on fakes like reflectors 
 He had sugar in his ear in his last crack career 
 We can can him, manhandle him, if you wanna 
 Run in his crib-o, get ditto, skate like a limo 
 And jet to the flyest estate, relate take a break 
 Break down an eighth and then wait drop it like Drake 
 Thugs they be booing and screwing, we canoeing 
 Claim they doing the same shit we doing, fuck your union 
 It's the same style, RZA trainable, jump the turn style 
 On the alley tried to challenge God for the new vials 
 Especially that, aluminum bat in the act 
 Relax, lay back, sell a grenade a day, it pays black 
 The Mac-10 flex white cats like Windex 
 Index finger be sore, busting these fly scripts 
 The Wally kid count crazily grands with our plans 
 Laying with my bitches and my man's in Lex Lands 
 We losing em, jet to the stash and now Jerusalem 
 Abusing em, rocking his jewels like we using 'em 
 Low pro star, seven thick waves rock Polar 
 Roll with the older God, build with the Son and the Star 
 All these MC's start realizing 
 That Ghost got that shit, that'll keep you vibing 
 The Wu is here to bring, you Shaolin's finest 
 But if your shields are weak, you better step behind us 
 (Ghostface Killer) 
 Mercury raps is roughed then God just shown like taps 
 Red and white Wally's that match, bend my baseball hat 
 Doing forever shit, like pissing out the window on turnpikes 
 Robbin niggas for leathers, high swiping on dirt bikes 
 Voice be metal like Von Harper radio bubble 
 Murder sleep away camp, the fly lady champ 
 The arsonist, who burn with his pen regardless 
 Slaying all these earthlings and fake foreigners 
 In the Philippines, pick herbal beans, bubbling strings 
 Body chemical cream, we burn kerosene 
 The conviction of my tape is rape, wicked like Nixon 
 Long-heads inscriptions with three sixes in 
 Kiss the pyramid experiment with high explosive 
 I slap box with Jesus, lick shots at Joseph 
 Zooming like binoculars, the rap blacksmith 
 Money's Rolex, with sparkles, Chef ragtop is spotless 
 I'm Iron Man no cheap cash metal I'm steel alloy 
 True identity hidden inside secret tabloids 
 Breathe oxygen both sides of my jaw carry oxes 
 The track hit like the bangers, in hundred watt boxes 
 Yo jostling these cats while Little J be deli-ing 
 Sip Irish Moss out of Widelians 
 (Cappadonna) 
 Give me the the fifty thou, small bills 
 My gold plate, my slang kills 
 My Benz spills, what up Lils 
 Murder one Dunn 
 Killer bee stung, guess who back home Son 
 My technique of slang camp won, third platoon soon 
 Cristal bottles, cages of boom, probably wardrobe 
 The mad-hatter big dick style, beware goons 
 Smuggle balloons, lord of dooms, in fat pussy wombs 
 Let the Gods build, pull up the grill 
 Check out the mad skills 
 Top secret technique, too hard for you to peep it 
 And keep it, jiggy style of rap and watching knuckle slang 
 Sweep it out of order tape recorder can't record my slaughter 
 Spoil the rotten Don is too good to be forgotten 
 High top notch, borderline rhymes is handcocked 
 Ninety-six, my ill sound clash is still hot 
 Get yourself shot"

 I rock a Rolex but never got my time straight 
 I can't see shit something like a blind date 
 Pyrex vision, hologram cocaine 
 And when I gas niggas I call it propane 
 I used to hustle with the peeps under the boxers 
 And my little pocket stash, allin top rockers 
 And weed up for my dude Made Enrique 
 He also uptown but he live out in BK 
 Used to say DK, Diablo, papo 
 Partners with Pablo, heroin, italiano 
 Flush the work, overseas gots the work

 Indoors with whores, they soldiers 
 How at they go? We gon poke kill fly ride and roll

 You see all of these diamonds drippin' off it 
 And you get to pourin' wine in my glass 
 Havin' a seat and listen to science 
 Odometers sparkling, glisten off me 
 We ball until they call police and they tryna report me 
 We washin' all his brand like a nigga doing the laundry 
 See a nigga tryna chill while you niggas tryin' to force me 
 Bitches cleanin' my ratchets, I'm a get to blammin' 'em shortly 
 Where the fuck you tryna step up like you some kind of contendant 
 You's a bitch, reminding me of some kind of a sex offender 
 I'll burn you to a crisp, leaving nothing more than your digit 
 You hear the family bitch, I inherit the name defending 
 Nothing's surprising bout niggas like you up on a stretcher 
 And squeeze until they leak, it's all like applying the pressure, pause

 I control 26,000 men. Except for dope, we operate in all aspects 
 Of organized crime. And if there's one thing I'm sure of 
 It's that drugs destroy your mind and destroy your home 
 In the end it'll only lead our country into ruin

 The biochemical slanglord'll throw the Arabs 
 In the dope fiend, vocal chords switch laser beams 
 My triple sevens broke the slot machines out in Queens 
 Grey Poupon is Revlon rap, smack pawns, swing like batons

 Check the gummy sole, underneath my shoe lies the tap 
 That attract bow-legged bitches with wide horse gaps 
 In steel mills Iron he'll smoke the blow on duns 
 You run errands, Primatene Mist is afraid of my lungs 
 Turn my channel, it'll blow your whole bench off the panel 
 Like eighty roman candles that backfired then slammed you 
 Every day is like a video shoot, check this shit 
 I take it back to Playboy, stash guns in whips 
 Picture afro picks, shish kabobs and dashikis 
 Thousands civil marched, raised their fists in early sixties 
 Now check this one, you must have been stupid to miss this one 
 Donna shogun-ing flip a ton of fashion 
 Destination be the cash one, I step past one 
 Don't make me blast one, I'm cold like eskimo flow 
 Cappa villain stay chillin' take shots of penicillin 
 Clean out and let the steam out, she fiend to blow out 
 But I'm equipped with mad white, Morris The Rap got nine lives 
 I'll take a few hundred thousand dollar dives 
 And then I still never go down 
 Until the last round I shine 
 When RZA do his thing motherfucker, I'mma do mine 
 Now, where I come from cats be carrying, marrying drug money 
 Fuck up your wife, get four to life 
 Cream we handling, Midtown niggas scrambling 
 Move and examine the fly shit, plus quick to buy shit 
 Chef, yeah, you know the whole gods astral 
 Fidel Castro suits plus depositing cash rule 
 Big time, play it like Canadian wine 
 RZA's divine now, the sacredness of one's true mind 
 Now let's get colorful like money green 
 High roller coaster, Sosa, million dollar nigger roaster 
 Yeah God, be having my whole steez laced 
 Now let's rap a taste, connect dots, aim Glocks, train stop 
 Figaro fly jewelin', tri-color Cubans 
 Swerving we'll pow with Germans in Suburbans 
 Twenty-four niggas with vests on, my own restaurant 
 Dons sending my sons membership forms 
 And still getting this paper scraper 
 Fake gators from Jamaica, wizards be passing like Lakers 
 And it be coming from Lex Louis Rich Liberace 
 Fetus style and blocking goals like hockey"

 Listen, man, it's going on 2007, g 
 I wanna wish y'all motherfuckers a happy New Year 
 (New Year, let's give it up) How your 2006 was son? 
 (Go and get up, get up, y'all niggas is crazy 
 Y'all know how I get, my 2006 off, nigga I broke two of my toes, nigga 
 It's going down nigga, that's what's up, y'all niggas is crazy) 
 That's why you came to the show with, um, peanut butter on your toes, that day 
 (Nigga, why you gotta bring everything up? Man, everybody here enjoying) 
 Nah, son, because your shit's, (crazy, a happy New Year 
 This muthfucka) Nah, boy, yo (no, man) But your shit was looking mad timid 
 That was the funniest shit in the book, that day (Find out who) 
 That's your toes right there! (Who the fuck said I broke 'em) 
 Yo, how you put them little baby cast on there? (Just a little punk ass nigga man) 
 How you put them in the baby cast like that, though, son? 
 Come on, son, that's what I was, that shit, yo 
 Let me tell you something, I ain't gon' front, yo

 I love you my nigga, Happy New Year's! 
 Fuck that, let's get this paper! 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Yo, yo I was sitting at the table thinking 
 How the hell do I murder these M.C.'s, sting 'em like bees 
 My attitude's that of Hannibal, not compatible 
 Why I would damage you, fuck, if I drink, then ran with you 
 Y'all chose to war, so called rich niggas wanna verse the poor 
 I'll rob you first, then go to your earth, it's not gon' hurt 
 If you try calling the cops, it's not goin' work 
 All you gotta do is lay in the dirt, we dug a hole 
 And my guns weight more, yo, then Gerald Levert 
 With more blubber than a Ruben Studdard, I grease the pan 
 With rhymes, and y'all can't believe it's not butter 
 I told y'all to chill, stretch all out like franks on the grill 
 With a classic deal, I'm like a farmer when I'm playing the field 
 Just painting my seeds, in 20-06, it's time to build 
 ""Ghost is back"" [Repeat: x4] 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Yo, I cooked up the beef, seasoned up the meat 
 Fried 'em, tried 'em, took it out the grease 
 Ghost came to steal the show, since you loving your broad 
 I'ma lay back and reveal your hoe 
 She a brain therapist, chick you can't kiss 
 Opened up her legs, like ""ooh, I smell fish"" 
 Yeast infection, queen, she love dick 
 Shriveled up tits, she'll bang the whole Knicks 
 Now how can I salute you, kid, I'm planning to do you 
 Crucial, blow rugers at who you with 
 We bump heads while we out in the street, it's all good 
 My trigger fingers'll matter, kick the back of your feet 
 And your red monkey jeans, is looking like a scene from Baghdad 
 That's bad, flags red, dirt beds 
 Y'all niggas is eating, crystal meth' heads 
 We pissed out, wrist out, with the best threads 
 Knockin' niggas off, knockin' niggas out 
 Fucking up rappers is what I'm about 
 I'm holding Staten Island down, y'all cats must be dead 
 Keep fronting and lose your head 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 You can decide on who's liver 
 Toney Knight Rider, wisdoms love my saliva 
 Slobbin' 'em down, hoggin' the mound 
 Pitchin' 'em eight balls, robbing the town 
 Don't let your gangsta, get you murked up 
 Fagot ass homeys done got you worked up 
 Rappers can't come around, y'all wide rap is dead 
 Freeze, nigga, come off the bread 
 Whole horizon, hit 'em with toast, a rap arising 
 Ringing the boys bell like Verizon 
 Eyes, looking surprised, that the four-five 
 Yo Ghost, don't even do it, I got some more pie 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Word up, hey yo I'd like to give a mean shout out to Staten Island 
 Holding the boy down, y'all know what it do

 Yo Supa! Y'all know what it is, man, ya know what I'm saying?

 No Newports, Marlboro's here, go smoke that 
 The smoke in your face, bitch, I ain't never cared 
 Get shot down when the Ghost smell fear, let me hold something 
 Look in your face like you owe something 
 I'm playing for the 'bucks' like Hakeem Warrick 
 Nickel bag in the park, my team on it 
 They want it like that and the street, is dry as a well 
 Hell, that's why I sell crack on the beat 
 I ain't trynna just happen to eat, I'm a make a nigga dance

 Reefer lit, love hip hop, the gangstas got me like the broccoli 
 Brooklyn baby cooling at a swat meet 
 Real niggas wanna meet me, ladies wanna eat me 
 Money clean Mercedes claim, baby beat me 
 Love getting dressed up, sweats and techs 
 Ride around the hood, good, getting Gotti respect 
 Hand is golden, an OG rolling and holding, yo 
 Fresh kicks, soft leather, pockets is swollen 
 Let my jam hit your tape deck, it's straight up and made up 
 For every real nigga with his gun on him, hate up 
 Flying through the city nights, new flights 
 Blue ice, hundred thousand in a Nike bag, license 
 Drug shop, I'm sorry, Atari in the Ferrari 
 Next see the Lex A Shallah, La Tampa 
 Eating yo, all of us, scamma gangstas 
 You know we honor, tip the kangol, cooling in the brown vengos 
 I have never, giving up on a mission 
 That's against my honor 
 Duke, let me warn you, my niggas crip up 
 Them young boys'll run up on you, shoot your whip up 
 Brooklyn, nigga, beg for you life and my Staten Island homeys 
 Lay your ass down on 'Glaciers of Ice' 
 Sidewalk executives, live the street life consecutive 
 We built for this, go for your gun 
 My prospective is, another day in the life, of money and drugs 
 Big hammers and slugs can get ugly as fuck 
 From the chest to your man Danze 
 Staten Island, said what up, yo 
 The homey ODB said what up, though 
 We got the Chef on deck as if you didn't know 
 It's sharp as fuck, Wu, that's what up 
 Pack it up, wanna rap, wanna rock, what up? 
 Wanna pop, get up, fuck around and get your block hit up 
 Bring your team and we'll box 'em up, think MOP is not what up 
 It seems I'm a bit late here 
 Don't worry, these men are all gonna die 
 See from the side where it slum at, dum at, rum at 
 Cognac, combat, contact, contrast 
 Crom's packing out like Beyonce back 
 She bang out a song like the Fonz back 
 Bigger things, bring the slangs, slicker than the sharpest pen 
 Nigga here, combat, sweet dick Willie T, Rudy Ray Moore game 
 Woodgrain all in the board reigns, before rain flooded 
 Like storm drains, boss man, bundling raw 'caine 
 Fours bang, neighborhood war games 
 Get your weight up, you looking anorexic 
 Posted on the block proper with the hammer vested 
 Bitch came with empty hands, that's the hand she left with 
 Thirsty ass with the water and it sounded desperate 
 Break a white an hour, based it forty grand invested 
 Live within the third rail, you know the man electric 
 Shit was like the third world until I handle metrics, that next shit"

 Watch us shine and watch the World be our witnesses

 Verse 1: (Raekwon) 
 Observe real though 
 Half cieling of blow 
 Rhymin' Deniro dough 
 Dundalero yo 
 Let the steel blow 
 Hear me yo, wild trump style 
 Dons connect three hundred ones wow 
 Floatin' like a maccarel, that's foul 
 Most craziest, laziest 
 All eye seein', blaze this majorness 
 Mechanic record on a beige disc 
 Pain, whatever level bankrolls 
 Frequent plain clothes 
 Lex spit six, arrange those 
 Snot nose pros 
 Dark skin hoes 
 Crazy ill fly jersey Expos 
 Neck froze 
 Fuck your set, slash vetos 
 Still Lex knows 
 Gasoline jumper on with the most fly livest Gortex made in Mexico 
 Bricks Fifteen Five 
 Celine Dion ties 
 Two Thousand dollar bubble eyes 
 Yo, the theme cries 
 Rollin' for cream yo now watch the laser beam rise 
 Sling pies 
 Doin' our thing high. 
 Verse 2: (Baby Thad) 
 The chain of command is effective immediately, the cause and effect 
 It calls for your death 
 Black suburbans at night with no lights ram you off Hollywood Hills 
 Tearin' off the doors to your Lex 
 Steel Magnolia 
 Fear is takin' over ya 
 If you ain't bowlin' we rollin' straight over ya 
 If you ain't real about it don't talk 
 Hollow clips evict you, set supper for the Hawks 
 Send a missile at your ear like (whizz whizz) ""what was it?"" 
 Buzz the buzzers 
 Blow past with clutch buckets 
 They'd rather not see you in Malibu eatin' veal 
 Strength recognize strength, real recognize real. 
 Verse 3: (Chip Banks) 
 It ain't a game dick 
 You know us, European whips 
 Chain frost bit 
 Peter pay Paul now pay the boss kid 
 Heavens the stakes are now even 
 Sent the heat rash to your camp, left his shirt there now you barely 
 Breathin' 
 Slow leakin' 
 Look at your people weepin' 
 I ain't have to quickdraw Mcgraw you I could Fifty Two block you 
 Switch my stance up Southpaw, drop you 
 You got small digits, your riches is midgets to mine 
 You sip Ballantine, I'm crown Royale 
 Sit back laughin' while y'all plans foyale 
 Y'all funny style, you'll never make it to trial 
 It ain't a game kid. 
 Verse 4: (Rhyme Recca) 
 World premier, metal gear 
 Fanfare, stand clear 
 All jokes aside, this is our year 
 Still here for real y'all, bare witness 
 This is business 
 NewYork City's sickness 
 Simple street principle 
 Cream team invincible 
 Money interchangeable 
 Bulletproof Benzes 
 Ralph Lauren lenses 
 Soldiers in the trenches 
 Expansion 
 Four car garage, mini-mansion 
 Consolidated regiment 
 Connects like the President 
 Excellent 
 Rock waves with Three Sixty measurements 
 Chrome rims, new timbs 
 Exotic chains with red gems 
 Real estate 
 Corporation mindstate 
 Prosperity 
 Dealin' with the highest of integrity 
 Steadily, wall street bound 
 Walkin' on Holy ground 
 Give is the greatest of all, I spread my love around 
 Young black multi, this ain't a game son, we run businesses. 
 Verse 5 (Rza) 
 I burst like a sea crackin' through the earth, 
 Flower blossomin' 
 For your rhyme sickness spittin' anti-toxin 
 Best merk 
 Get your neck jerked 
 Dynamic mic teck squirt 
 Lyrics splurt blast the expert 
 To his head till his legs hurt 
 Knees become wobbly 
 King got love-love, born equal equality 
 Bring bodily harm, probably bust a brain artery 
 Kidnap the track 
 I could rap to the high hats 
 My widescreen imax lyric spread until the climax 
 Wu instrumental breaks scratch past the aftertake 
 Live performance concert, make shorty wop masturbate 
 In the tub legs open water be rushin' from the faucet 
 Thinkin' about the Wu-Tang gang bang she almost lost it 
 I move from the blood marked turf 
 Where the heart hurts 
 And merk to the heavily refined hills where the God lurks 
 Everyday I'm countin' 
 Son, my thoughts can move a mountain 
 So much joy in his eyes he'll make you cry a fountain 
 You purse snatch while I earth snatch and take the earth back 
 Have you runnin' like Devils bein' chased by the church"
142,Raekwon,hiphop,It's That Wu Shit,"O, most of the time, yo, I'm flicked up 
 Stepping out the crib like I'm sixed up, don't get it mixed up 
 Even if I'm shaking your hand, I'm still gripped up 
 With two spots left, yeah, we still bricked up 
 Trees pine, gleem no seed, young boys feeling they self, they must be on E's 
 Me? I stay outted out, boating on oceans 
 He banging my old chick, and he mad open 
 Think I smell the goons, they been business since the Tunnel days 
 Shanks out, they ready to move 
 Somebody yelled out 'ballin' 
 In two seconds, lord, they was up on 'em 
 That voice, should of slowed down, baby 
 Now what we gon' tell his lady 
 Jaw on the floor, looking all crazy 
 A lot of vicks been going down in here, lately 
 In 2012, the DJ is still recognized as the crowd controller 
 The record breaking, keep the bottles popping and all the ass shaking 
 It's that Wu shit, it's that movement 
 It's the Wu shit, in the house 
 Yo, should I talk about all the jewels I wore on my neck 
 While you had to tuck your little shit in out of respect 
 I'm a done, rebel out of Staten Island projects 
 I dare y'all to come in my projects 
 Leave with no head, no neck 
 You thought I was Flex, the way I bombed the set 
 In the hallway, banger house, smelling like cake 
 Tongueing bitches down, most of them got scraped 
 Watch how I move the crowd, I'm a make 'em, make 'em clap to this 
 No shit, no doubt 
 Two shots of Hennessey, ladies want Goose 
 Earlier them fronting niggas, now they want a truce 
 Mami got a bubble in her Jimmy Choo shoe 
 When I go and kick it, she's a goodie two-shoe? 
 Yeah, right, daddy got bread 
 Like J. Holiday, I wanna put you to bed 
 Tell me your girlfriends, kicks, don't let it go to your head 
 Walking around in your cheap ass threads 
 Get away from me, stinky 
 Yeah, yo, I spit lines from the rubble room 
 Bottom line, I kick mines, like a mother's womb 
 I'm, still in my prime, fuck them other dudes 
 No biting's the rule, but we can eat each others food 
 Flash a camera at the all time great 
 Single handing increase New York's crime rate 
 That's why I love it in the Empire State 
 The city where your fat ass can still find weight 
 But y'all ain't getting it, the game is different 
 And in the recession, a lot of veterans is quitting it 
 Every day I'm living it, your boy got blunts 
 Fighting after school, a lot of y'all got jumped 
 Staten Island, bro, ratchet under my coat, potato salads so 
 And we silencing that, just every day challenge us 
 Check a nigga out of respect, I'm spectacular, this the Massacre"
143,Raekwon,hiphop,Killa Killa Hill,"God rules everything around us 
 Goons get the money, Killa Killa Hill y'all 
 Yo, we grew up in the grind, y'all 
 Now it's our time to shine y'all, yo, we did our time y'all 
 Now we back to collect our check, give us our respect 
 Debts gotta get paid off, a nigga hit the deck 
 My Goon Squad coming correct, handcuffs, Jakes backin' us up 
 We got it rough, on some guns bust 
 Niggaz hold dust, through it all, kept our head off 
 Feds sped up, niggaz in my hood read up 
 We still gully, and my whole click dead up 
 Clackin' them shots, right, my Goon Squad kick lead up 
 I'm from the Valley where the Goons stay, valors and S.K.'s 
 Shoot up your saloon and lay 
 Through a poverty side of my life, we came from 
 All the big niggaz eat meals, real niggaz kept ones 
 So much drugs in a box, gloves, couple glocks 
 Thugs that stay on blocks, wolves that lay on cops 
 Dressin' like gangstas, I've been silkin' it before Courvoisier and blunts with rocks 
 We had to eat to live, 'cause only real niggaz protect 
 Lively hood, and get Hollywood props 
 I ran with arm specialist who loved to shoot, wrestle, spit 
 Bang bitches, buy a little drizzle and box 
 For all that we know, I analyze the rich steelo 
 Milk the game, Suge Knight a few people 
 Then made a lot of deposits, throughout the logic 
 My mental came swift, that's the project 
 Aiyo, my team pressed up on the crime side 
 Them devils tried to catch us all, guarding our blind side 
 I cocked back the hammer, load up on my nine side 
 Startin' a revolution, like my Goon Squad died, poverty strucken 
 Right where the poor people reside, deep in the hood 
 Young bloods stay flippin' them pies, lookin' for easy ways out 
 My niggaz try'nna survive, whippin' the gauge out 
 Strugglin', against all odds, stompin' the rage out 
 Duckin' down deep in them cars, whippin' the page out 
 Niggaz stay kickin' them bars, knockin' ya fade out 
 Get ready for my Goon Squad stars, let the parade out"
144,Raekwon,hiphop,Kilo Remix,"Yo, Oh, Yo Rae... I can't feel my face 
 My heart pounding and shit (audible heart) 
 Paranoid as a motherfucker right now, who the fuck? 
 Close the blinds and shit! Who that? Captain Kirk? 
 The Stark... enterprise, enterprise I was on and some shit? 
 ...I need some pussy though I'm ready for a Catwoman or something 
 F-fuck it, lets go! 
 Aiyyo Shareefa go to the store for me. I need some razors and a fresh box 
 Of baggies, the ones with the tint in them! 
 Aiyyo son turn that water down a little bit, just a little bit... Thank You 
 I need two waters, a dutch, and a cranberry Snapple) 
 All around the world today, the Kilo is the measure 
 (Whoever got the kilos got the candy, man) 
 A kilo is a thousand grams, its easy to remember 
 (You never catch the kid going hand to hand) 
 All around the world today, the Kilo is the measure 
 (Once you got the funds you got the panties, man) 
 A Kilo is a thousand grams, its easy to remember 
 (Throughout the I 9 to 5 I'm the Handyman) 
 Racing through the hood, ski mask off 
 Criminology hustle, when goons play the heat, blast off 
 And every direction, protect ya babies, your moms 
 Late night like Carson Daly, Theo Bailey, we stay armed 
 Grits box, vacuum tight, concealing the powder 
 Five fake cans of blow to throw them off wit the flower 
 Red dots on me, big scopes, bullets the size of nickels 
 Got Starkey coming out of his coat 
 I gots to jet, don't look back, my cardio's killing me 
 Old ladies is like 'Hold ya head, Tone, literally' 
 All this, for a thousand grams? 
 I'd rather be a con artist scheming with a thousand scams 
 Aiyyo peace to those cooking that raw, powder white 
 Get your sniff on, scarface niggaz, we getting right 
 Some call it bricks, some call it birds 
 How many niggaz get they lives tooken playing with shit, then catch a curb 
 You would go to jail 
 Get caught with this, niggaz'll grow to fail 
 Stop playing, pot slaying, baking soda and scales 
 They lived like brothers, word life, connects discovered 
 Most niggaz get hard, from fucking with them pipes and hustlers 
 Kilos is one thousand grams 
 You know your ammo better be heavy 'cause soon kids is coming in camo 
 Protect your land daddy, I'm an announcer 
 You get caught with an ounce and it's over 
 Matter 'fact they takin' you down, son 
 Bricks, Tar caps, powder, cooked up crack 
 Phones is tapped over franklin's stacks 
 Kingpins put in bullpens, old connects get paro' 
 Break out of town when the Jakes take down the Pharaoh 
 Reason, He was moving that Peruvian white 
 Blowing coolies into hoopties, slamming cuties and ice 
 Big heavy pots over hot stoves 
 Mayonnaise jars of water with rocks in them got my whole projects out of order 
 A Kilo is a thousand grams 
 Beige, gold, brown, dirty, fluffy, tan, extract oil cut from cuban plants 
 The chemist is brolic, pyrex scholars 
 Professors at war over raw, killing partners for a million dollars 
 Some say a drug dealers destiny is reachin' the ki' 
 I'd rather be the man behind the door, supplying the streets 
 A hundred birds go out, looking like textbooks 
 When they wrapped and stuffed 
 Four days later straight cash, two million bucks 
 Strictly powder, no cut 
 Your coke is vialed in, what's up? 
 Y'all beefin over little shit, we sniff, the balance split up 
 In a plane or a penthouse, office or a warehouse 
 Tony's got it nice, we never heard of any big droughts 
 A Kilo is a thousand grams 
 A pile of sand is equivalent, to the eye 
 It's nice to have a thousand fans 
 Coke buyers, some be liars 
 Therefore, you check for wires 
 Dedicated dealers, during holidays we give 'em lighters 
 Red tops, blue tops, green tops, yellow tops 
 Purple tops, beige tops, white tops, grey tops 
 Black tops, clear tops, gold tops, pink tops 
 Silver tops, tan tops, aqua tops, orange tops 
 Salt tops, long tops, short tops, 12 12's 
 58 58's, weed bags, ziplocks 
 Big rocks, coke spots, big glocks, one OT's 
 Crumbs chopped, hot pots, one plate, crack Spot 
 Thirteen getting it, pyrex whipping it 
 Like UPS, pack it up, shipping it 
 Whether base or sniffing it, I got your fix 
 The story's foretold like apocalypse 
 It was me Michael T.T., handing out freebies 
 Taking over blocks, telling niggas to be fee 
 Where big brother 'Vine'll leave the body in the street 
 Something kinda like how I be bodying the beat 
 We was 300 deep like the Persian soldiers 
 Word spread fast, we was serving boulders 
 Ten crack commandments, holy Moses 
 If you don't fit must equip icer toners 
 Never grip they holders, fingers to the snitchers 
 The New York niggas be taking all our bitches 
 But we be God damned if taking all our business 
 Duct tape, hard tops, C.S.I. forensics"
145,Raekwon,hiphop,Life's A Gamble,"Aiyo, when we writing, yo, shit is like the vice laws 
 Fighting everybody wet, Lex dog, vibe on biting necks 
 There goes the new hammer, microwave blamp, from the stove to the roads 
 Down in New Hampshire, brolic size, wallet guys 
 Frame broiled shotties, with the Ducati's, my pockets is set 
 Now watch what you rep, I've been buying niggas heads 
 Wall crawler, Captain Caveman, in the hall scrawling 
 Money is stacked up, better than yours 
 Do with the rappers, clap niggas, slap 'em, and car jack 'em 
 Everything niggas is serving, is crack, what, preferably Kellogg's 
 You just a goldmine, yup, cereal bowls of heroin 
 Yup, the Don Baron, it's worth hundreds, say something 
 Niggas fronting while we doubling, pump 'em 
 And lay 'em right in front of the steps 
 The new Mark Cuban, Mavericks, we moving like Arabics 
 Faces is wrapped, crosses on like Catholics 
 Blend to the music, it's all in the game 
 Riding through life in this fast lane, fast change 
 Y'all deal when the lights green, but when that light change 
 You gotta make a slight change, use your wipers cause it might rain 
 Life's a gamble like a dice game 
 Aiyo, I'm when I'm writing I be thinking like Donald Goines 
 Posted up on the strip, fishing like bitches hoeing 
 Blowing like Jesse Owens, run laps around these tracks 
 And I stay up in the hood like, weed and cracks 
 Damn right, I still pack the strap, duck if I whip it out 
 But if I whip it out, you're people will be picking out 
 A coffin and a tombstone, park 'em in the graveyard 
 Prayers and a leap of faith, probably couldn't save y'all 
 That's the path of bravehearts, clap you in the hallway 
 Turn two o's that soft, into three the hard way 
 Move the diesel all day, shut it down in night time 
 That's when the undercovers buy, in night time 
 Move to the forefront, Ratch' had the store front 
 First I had two goals, now I got more front 
 Bitch I been G'd up, put a O in front of that 
 Keep them bitches ski'd up, blowing off each other's back 
 Heavy white ice, gold ornaments, hustle and life 
 Hustle and light, good with the pill 
 Be at all the tournaments, stroll in the beach 
 Out in Luv Allah, we love all of y'all 
 Killah Hill, Staten Africa, rap massacre 
 Make a phone call, have niggas get at cha 
 Rat ya, two double nines in the back of the Acura, it's a Don thing 
 Don King, Don bitches under the ring 
 We don't ever sing, raps get cut in the bing 
 Posse up, see me the Beemer or Benz truck 
 Reppin' that W, it's trouble for you 
 Knife through ya bubble goose, veterans loose, thirty nine on the deuce 
 Pick it up, stick it up, niggas is thinking to bust 
 Breaking these states for they cake, you know what it do 
 What's up, Goldie? Niggas wanna march, hanging with Jody 
 Street Flavor click, roll thicker than shit 
 We the upmost, faggot niggas get bitched 
 Smacked with the toast, crackin' the line in the coke 
 Niggas'll cutthroat, cutthroat, inferred on top of the scope 
 Crack in the dial, mixed with soap, Killah Island"
146,Raekwon,hiphop,Live It,"I deserve to play, it's been a few days, ain't showed it all 
 I go outside and breathe, roll down my sleeves and have a ball 
 Still got these bills to pay and a family, I'm workin' hard 
 But I got a life too, so I throw on my shoes and I live it y'all 
 I'm fresher than a peppermint and cold as a cough 
 When I pull up in that foreign and I break boys off 
 Super ballin' is a product of a hard knock life 
 No more Ramen noddles bread, no more struggle and strife 
 From a Buick to a Beamer, ambitions of a dreamer 
 Motivated by Mob Figaz and Andre Nickatina 
 I'm gettin' paper while you're in the shade drinkin' Zima 
 I'm a schemer, you just waitin' on your check from FEMA 
 Been evadin' the subpoena to appear in court 
 Different hustle every season like I'm playin' a sport 
 ""Life is Too short, wouldn't you agree?"" 
 See, the best time I ever had in my life was free 
 My best friend wasn't real, he came with a fee 
 Reduced time for your sentence come with a plea 
 Livin' in the free world and I'm blessed 
 Paper chasin' is my quest, I grind with no rest 
 I'm not a actor, a role model with soul or clapper 
 I work hard, a good gangsta nigga, blow a stack up 
 Time still movin' and shit, stay on the grind, it's just excuses 
 Girls lookin' at you, you useless (word?) 
 When everything is wrong, it look like it'll fall 
 I'm on the job feet first with direction and all 
 I like coca and then gotta come home and stroke her 
 Take time, clean my rims and go lock' her 
 Just wanna lay up, damn 
 I need two minutes to rest, go 'head and take the Lex' out, scram 
 Then it's beef in the jump off, 'cause I needed one off 
 It's like you drew your gun on me in a gun off 
 Shit won't change, so move with it (move with it) 
 This is my life, I'm only livin' it, so don't go and ruin it 
 Words from a legend, keep your dome up in the sky 
 Listen to Paul Wall and Chef Fly (get high) 
 Dear Mr. President, have you seen FEMA? 
 Have you seen the Lord 9th Ward, post Katrina? 
 Niggaz scufflin' tryin' to find something tangible 
 The impedes is treatin' all the youth like animals 
 Then wonder why the cops gettin' rocked like Mosley 
 Why niggaz on the TV in the spot like cozy 
 Now Houston got a problem, Atlanta got a problem 
 Dallas, Alabama and Miami got a problem 
 Niggaz wildin' out, livin 
 free, yellin' sovereign 
 .38 revolvin', crack rock ballin 
 Tats on they face that say Uptown New Orleans 
 Blastin' on sight, fuck fightin', fuck arguin' 
 Meanwhile boat loads of cash go to Israel 
 Soldiers in Iraq pray to God for a miracle 
 Sam Cooke said that change was comin' 
 If not, you can bet your ass, danger's comin'"
147,Raekwon,hiphop,Mef Vs Chef 2,"Yo, blow my nose for me, man 
 Word up, man (fuck them) 
 Spit in your mouth, piss on your bitch 
 We them wrist getters, everything real bout this, duke 
 You fucking with them niggas that's splashed up, slave master's master 
 Dumb move, blast your slut 
 We want it all, living in Persia, burn something 
 Snow White rose, bulldog ershkama 
 Yo take that, drive that around the corner 
 Yeah, shit on your crew, nigga, it's Wu 
 Rap athletes, the trap sheet bigger than you 
 If you ask me, the Cash Rule 
 Nigga, eat that pussy, you cat food 
 I sneeze on the track, get at you 
 I'm sick in the head, I'm getting some head 
 If she ain't bout getting some bread, don't get in this bed 
 Real talk, mami, you gotta bounce 
 Wild like Indians, Al Capone-ians 
 Not from Chicago, my gun named Margo 
 It's only when we in beef, we humble in deep 
 Might kill four-five niggas, die in my sleep 
 I argue though, who the best, we hardly know 
 I came through in the S, wash me, yo 
 Yo, yo, do that for me, go around that car 
 Niggas, digging they nose, and digging they ass 
 When I got chips, can't none of y'all dig in my bag 
 I pop shit, my killas is black, I got chicks that got chicks 
 My real world realer than rap 
 I'm hot, bitch, material, Meth, beyond lyrical 
 Wake up every morning eat that Captain Crunch cereal 
 That's that shit right there 
 Dick game super, grupa fish, Cris' Krug' lottos 
 I'm a bring it back, one wish 
 Fresh to death, I'm always, always Rae in the hallways 
 Yeah, always stay 
 Y'all rappers gon' feel my pain, but the other way around 
 When it's going down, I'm gon' rain 
 That's my chair, nigga, get the fuck out of it 
 Yo, fuck you, pay me, if Dirt Dog could see me now 
 He'd probably say ""Fuck you, pay me"" 
 Blowing smoke clouds, shit's crazy 
 Doo-rag your dome, get wavy, rap ain't done shit for me lately 
 It's ass backwards, this game trynna play me 
 I bet this never happens to Jay-Z 
 Get money, fuck them haters, real talk 
 Pay me, play me, weigh he, just the right measurement 
 This may happen in a day, G 
 I'm a keep it real, for real G's, niggas is lame 
 Industry pussies, we can't feel these 
 Regardless that I'm paid in flossy, rich in the mind 
 I do this for the nine niggas who forced me 
 Y'all niggas is playing me, man"
148,Raekwon,hiphop,Miranda,"Yo, man, just let her live, man, stop playing, man 
 Oh, shit, B, where's Miranda? (She with Chef) 
 I dreamed it, Chef out in Cuba, a ruger 
 Thirty thou' on him, out in Mr. Chow, blew a cloud on him 
 Seen a Latin chick, laughing, clapping 
 Like your style, homey, tell your proud, hit the Crystal 
 Now we chatting, coebers and klickos, who do this a size six 
 She split up, had a brick, I peeped those 
 Her jeans was fitted, hair twisted, long as a fuck 
 She looked Indian, titties was plump 
 Had juicy lips, dimples, imprint on her pussy was mad thick 
 She grabbed my dick, hopped in the window 
 We in the Monte Carlo, bravo, uncle named Pablo 
 Gun connect, and he had his poke in Los Cabos 
 Good money, honey was strung, playing Luther in the background 
 Spanish version, my bunny was horny as fuck 
 Working the kid, we burst later, lay in the bed 
 Duvet sheets, my face hit the spread 
 Then time me, I'm not the kind of nigga, I was cool down at night 
 Drop my gun, shorty, my nigga 
 Body was sexy, ""Lexy, come here, nigga, take off your drawers 
 Let me suck your dick, nigga, it's yours 
 Got real watery, Corey, damn you got good dick 
 You forty"" spit on it, position your jaw 
 Call me 8-Ball, this pussy like China, climb the Great Wall 
 Then she came like volcanos in the late fall 
 Lady Miranda, she half black and white like a panda 
 I met her at the BET Awards, in Atlanta 
 Glamor girl, shopping in Bloomingdale's, skin pure 
 Keep a fresh manicure, hands with the cutest nails 
 Wall Street banker, hold accounts with Jewish now 
 Big businessmen, who own stocks in computer sales 
 Meanwhile, I'm checking her jeans out, imagining 
 Her fat bubble, riding my dick, making her scream out 
 She got a mean mouth, her lips is like soup coolers 
 Hotter than niggas riding around with six rugers 
 Miss Beaulah took a day off with a rich jeweler 
 When she came back she had a suitcase full of Fig Newtons 
 I met her at a villa in Vancouver, blowing her man's buddah 
 Bumping Mary J. and that Grand Puba 
 Check the 411, from a smooth operator 
 Got some pictures of her naked, I'll send them to Un later 
 Ay Dio mio, mamacita ass bonita 
 Remind me of the nights of Del Rio 
 I met at the Cotto fights, playing my seat though 
 That night, the linen was white, me and my hijos 
 Live from Puerto Rico, San Juan, where niggas sniff pedrico 
 Look at your man wrong, finito 
 Girl you know how we go, you getting my grown man on 
 Fuck with you primo, maybe I'm hands on, I'll massage your ego 
 And be the love of your life, you know your people, a thug and his wife 
 Gave a look, she was touching my ice, so I looked at my dick 
 Like don't worry, we fucking tonight 
 She boricua, cinnamon skin, sign is Libra 
 She like wife beaters and men that like to eat her 
 Then I meet your feet up, meet me in room 112, light this reefer 
 You act right, and after tonight, I might keep ya"

 Verse One: 12 O'Clock 
 It's nine-six I'ma bang you with some hits 
 In two-thousand six I got my son makin' hits

 And besides, see I never had a million 
 Got beefs that got millions and in buy-outs worth billions

 Found a million fans in the Lexus to the Lands 
 So whose the cat in the comfy black Ac? 
 As a matter of fact, I sick/six fingers I'm from fat 
 My projects be the livest that it gets 
 Watch me ---- back Tex and do murders in the backsteps 
 I want that b---h with a Lex, a house out in New Mex

 So let RaZAh rip across your face, you're frosting 
 Verse Two: Raekwon the Chef 
 Push this s--t out like nine months 
 Rock Swahali and suede fronts, get paid from n----z

 Jubilant cats they keep pagin me 
 Peace what's the signs ock? 
 Fruit of life like the apricot 
 Cocktails tossin 'em at cops on blocks 
 Park Hillian, drug hillbillies made billions 
 Get a gun, kidnap, eight nine Jimmyians 
 Yo, he had about this amount in his Swiss account 
 Gunnin this out we reminesces on this b---h's house 
 Back in time, was a bad fiend 
 Now I flex mad green get cream seven-fifty n----l gleam 
 Say hi to chocolate t--i f----d lives

151,Raekwon,hiphop,Our Dreams,"No matter how hard, the task may seem 
 Don't give up our plans, don't give up our dreams 
 No broken bridges, can turn us around 
 'Cause what we're searchin' for, will soon be found 
 Aiyo, listen here, shorty, Camay glow 
 You know we both make angels when we lay in the snow 
 Heat the house with the oven when the cheese got low 
 Cause Toney, can't be out there pushing that blow 
 You made plans and dreams, not grands of schemes 
 I wanna search for the meaning of love, see what it means 
 'Cause we hustle so hard, cross so many bridges 
 Made babies, took trips to the mall, for family pictures 
 And our souls is magnetic, we the meaning of destiny 
 Be that banker of trust that looks to invest in me 
 Together, to get her, means for me to get you 
 We back, reunite like the Wu 
 See we soul mates, we melt like cookies and cream 
 And I fiend for the days and the nights to sex my queen 
 So no matter how hard it seems, dreams come true 
 Keep Allah in our hearts, hugs and kisses, Toney Starks 
 Uh, still applying the pain 
 The purple frying my brain, this woman's crying again 
 She, tired of fighting, my feelings likely the same 
 That's what happens when you wife 'em and they try to tighten the chain 
 See, she in the right, so I put her right in her lane 
 I'm all night with the pipe, I can feel her biting my chain 
 She, got her own, I ain't gotta buy her a thang 
 I be burning up the sheets every time I'm lighting the game 
 We, go together like, Martin and Gina, but 
 She get uptight when we fight like Ike and Tina, so 
 Love her or leave her alone, like I ain't need her tho 
 A minute later I'm back, like I ain't mean it, yo 
 We break up, just to make up, she fly without the makeup 
 Together we upgrade to A plus 
 So all this bickering ain't us, we bigger than that 
 You normally cool when I'm digging your back, now fall back, baby 
 Shorty with the flavor like Breyer's, real sweet with your thick legs 
 Look like you drink eggs, you lying 
 Now you met a teflon don, stay high, Levi's on 
 Wire cell frames, no games 
 I'm into cashing in, getting this paper, buying up acres 
 Ride around, and yo, fuck with my neighbors 
 Pocket full of hundreds and weed, light the Philly cigar up 
 And go dolo, riding through SoHo 
 You hear the little baby in the back? That's the sound of sweet life 
 A sweet wiz'll make you a sweet night 
 And chill with the pawns we on, 'cause life is a chessboard 
 You better have you sword and vest on 
 Never hate your enemies, 'cause it effects judgment 
 They only hate it if they know you getting hella cheese 
 That's what it is, what it do for you 
 Don't let the truth bore you, word up, don't let the roof spoil"
152,Raekwon,hiphop,Outta Town Shit,"I'm six foot two and a half 
 With shoes on make it three even 
 Been shot but I'm still breathing 
 Sent niggaz back to Pittsburgh 
 With they necks wrapped up no lie 
 See that's what happens when slugs fly 
 Doves cry when a thug dies 
 It might rain if you're a love guy 
 Glocks we tote 'em in belong pawn shops where we resold 'em 
 And going in we let the fiends hold 'em 
 Fake aliases, no driver's license or socials 
 But we cold cheek shit, so many hammers left the clerk speechless 
 Outdoors my niggaz is dirty 
 Rollin' smoke in the back seat sippin' orange juice 
 Bumping Blackstreet, suede wallets, Wallabees 
 Pea soup Clarks, music blastin', laughin' with the whip in park 
 Bodies for lunch, they eat those 
 Old school guns is like old albums, clean 'em and they keep goin' 
 Hey man it's rough outside 
 Crack heads is buyin' all night 
 Handguns is necessary 
 Fuck around you might lose your life 
 Anywhere in and outta town be 
 The same every hood it's so real 
 That you gotta be on your grizzly 
 If not then you might get pideeled 
 Like one day right over a powerful dice game in Minnesota 
 We hit the mall up for kicks 
 Slid, in other words bounce, tip the chauffeur 
 To get that cheddar cheese back we lost from earlier 
 Get back the dices shaking, stretching my arm like Troy Aikman 
 What's in the bank? Nigga what? Twelve grand bowl 'em 
 No little shit on the floor roll 'em 
 That's what I do (sounds of dice shaking) 
 Six 'em girls, hit his kicks 
 I'm a still show that motherfucker he fish 
 Pound cake, beat that bitch 
 Holy smoke! I admire your roll 
 Two fours and a five, they all applause and he smiled 
 But confident me, yeah I threw my twelve on the ground 
 Grab the dice, blew on 'em 
 Passed off the other thirty five thou, I'm doin' 'em 
 Nigga move shoot 'em, what's that? You roll a five? 
 Twenty or better y'all, I'm taking all side bets! Everybody spread out! 
 Watch the magic number that my pretty hand let out 
 My first roll was one two four, picked 'em up 
 Somebody screamed out, ""Tony Starks headed for the dust off!"" 
 I'm like hell no I'm headed for the gun store 
 Punch you in your motherfuckin' face like Spongebob 
 Watched his face when he aced, the place got quiet 
 Bowled like twenty forty times, my arm got tired 
 Couldn't hit a point, not even a deuce 
 Took a swig of my man's goose 
 Anything just to give me a damn boost 
 Then out came a wonderful six 
 Holy shit! Stack that shit 
 Yo Trife Dies snatch that fuckin' cream quick 
 That was one one six, one sixteen point see 
 And I don't care about no motherfuckin' Royce Green 
 He pulled out, he pointed at me, I pointed at him 
 My main man pointed at them 
 They pulled their guns out and pointed at him 
 And crazy shells they was coming in 
 Hey man it's rough outside 
 Crack heads is buyin' all night 
 Handguns is necessary 
 Fuck around you might lose your life 
 Anywhere in and outta town be 
 The same every hood it's so real 
 That you gotta be on your grizzly 
 If not then you might get pideeled 
 This just in, breaking news 
 Today in Downtown Minnesota, a tragic shootout occurred at 5:23 pm 
 An alleged witness says things went haywire over a dice game 
 Two black males were shot in their buttocks 
 Leaving one critically wounded 
 Two others were pronounced dead on the crime scene 
 At a nearby hospital, three New York men are recovering 
 In stable condition but are being held under police supervision at this time 
 For on the spot coverage 
 Theodore TV, this is Dusty Williams signing off 
 Now back to Tony Starks already in progress"
153,Raekwon,hiphop,Pimpin' Chipp,"Yeah, them niggas talking bout y'all always want some lyrics, right? 
 Real lyrics, well here we go, I'm a tell you a little story 
 That's right, watch this shit, nigga, here we go, y'all, your ass 
 Yeah, we write for days, hot shit, uh-huh 
 Dope, drugs, sex, murder, King James version 
 Aiyo, needle was left hanging, in the arm of a pimp 
 He walk with a limp, had bitches on the payroll 
 He gave the seeds candy and his family was poor 
 Drove a '68 Caddy with the fur on the door 
 The other macks ain't have jack on him, not even Goldie 
 Slowly, he would rise, kept his runners with the police 
 Jim Brown was his man, his brother was Muslim, they tried to convert him 
 And turn righteous, but the streets got the good of him 
 Big hats with gorgeous stones, honey designed the slacks 
 With two attempts on his bottom bitch, her name was Precious 
 Silky skin, priceless pussy, she took karate 
 Her bubble ass got Pretty Chipp rich 
 You can smell her perfume on every street corner 
 A sexy motherfucka with the mean face on her 
 Precious, sported bulletproof dresses, defending caring sex 
 Thirteen smith, this boo that study her lessons 
 She was the key to Pretty Chipp riches, bitches is fortune slang 
 Control the south side, her name rings 
 Lookout for the black cherry pussy extortion 
 Any other hoes get pregnant, bet they get an abortion 
 Back at the pub, at the Alice spot, bumping the sounds of Curtis 
 Playing Live in the jukebox, this broad named Cookie 
 In the purse, fifty thou' in cash 
 Passed off to Chipp, told him count it fast, another 10 in my bloomers 
 Fuck the rumors, it's lies, baby, you my daddy 
 Bitches never saw me jumping out of Dirt Dog's cabby 
 I'm a loyal bitch, and chicks can't stand me, pimps 
 They know I'm ill, that's why they never put hands on me 
 From Fillmore Slim to Goldie, Pretty Toney 
 Frank War told me, C.C. get that money 
 My potentials, credentials, my mouth stay hot 
 Like Chinese mushrooms, wasabi with spicy lentils 
 The other day I brought a little gat, where I keep near my lower back 
 Cause these niggas don't know how to act 
 At the Apollo, Ray Charles told me 
 Bitch just get in the car, 'cause I want you to swallow 
 I jumped in, and his bodyguards follow 
 He was quick, I spit the nut on his '74 wallos 
 He wanted to invite me to Chicago, I said 'nah, daddy' 
 He pushed me out and lit up a Marlboro 
 (Nah, papi) 'Cause I'm from New York 
 He taught me the talks, he taught me the walk 
 'Cause I'm Chipp's bitch, we dine and resort 
 Only nigga ever taught me, don't put swine on my fork 
 And that's the truth, rest in peace, papi 
 This Cookie, I still got another tall Goose for you daddy 
 I'm a stick in the grave for you, baby 
 Fuck them other pimps, they ain't got shit on you, daddy"
154,Raekwon,hiphop,R.a.g.u.,"Hold it! 
 Now you get out of here, I'm warning you 
 (You bastards can't push us around, wanna fight?) 
 I'll take you on 
 (Raekwon) 
 That nigga's twisted 
 Stop playing with that clip man 
 Close them fucking blinds too man, ya know what I'm saying? 
 Yo Don my man, get out of the stove man 
 Get away from the stove nigga 
 Stop playing man, the fuck is you talking 'bout? 
 I'm in the crib watching Larry King Live, the new Gucci's on 
 Refrigerator, smoking some kush, this nigga's a lighter 
 Swisher, becoming a roach, go get the glass ashtray 
 Pour the glass of Crut, tap the bottle then toast 
 Barrie took a sip for the cause, yeah my son 
 Soon to be 3, tried to fill his bottle then run 
 Then I got a collect call, heard niggas down the block is fighting 
 Some nigga got, knifed up brawling 
 Heard the kid was 19, Lil' Infinity too 
 His father worked up at the dealer he loved boo 
 They tried him for his Louis', son wasn't having it though 
 Yeah, yeah my nigga, the color of glue 
 Decided on a intervene, guess who tried to wild on me my nigga 
 This is like out of the blue 
 I'm in the Range stretch, jumped out, tucked the chain 
 Proceded to talk to him, then you heard the heavy face slap 
 Think I broke my wrist, now I'm at the hospital vexed 
 Fucked up my writing hand, that's my check 
 Now I wanna kill this lil' nigga true 
 Only thing that stop my gun flaming 'cause he related to you 
 (Ghostface) 
 Who? He ain't related to me 
 Just that I knew him for like 18 years until he violated, stealing my gear 
 If my lil' homey, yo he eat anything for me 
 Send him uptown, he get bagged, yo he never call me 
 Come home and still blow cats for me 
 Pump crack, stabbing all them hoodrat shorties 
 A live gunslinger well known, born to dance 
 When the heat is on, Stapleton days, shoot himself in the groin 
 The gun went off, it looked like a flick 
 When he fell to the floor, holding his nuts, screaming ""God dammit 
 Shit I put one in my balls, what the fuck y'all looking at me for? 
 Call the police, do something 
 Motherfuckers standing around, watch when I get better 
 All hell's gonna be terror 
 Death to you, you,"" he pointed at Red 
 I said chill that's fam duke 
 He put real work in that make you cute, fuck that 
 But anyway son indeed, he stole two Polo rugbies 
 Swore to his dead mother, I couldn't take it 
 Yo Lord I knocked out his teeth 
 Now he's rocking those false joints like everything's peace"
155,Raekwon,hiphop,Radiant Jewels,"Chef, let's do it 
 Criminal kingpins, gangstas and cheap friends 
 Actors, vixens, niggas put your kicks in 
 Blood money when we hawking 
 Awkward gun that go around curves 
 Bullets braze niggas with coffin, yo 
 Watch how to rhyme with hammers, I got two mens 
 That don't speak English, shooting game's bananas 
 Down in Spain, my bangles, clusty, checking my swings 
 Trillions on, yo, cuffing my jeans 
 Broad day, yo, body another, my microphone is like 
 Blow 'caine, one, pull the trees, you love us, yo 
 So killers be cool, pimps, read rules 
 When a grown man is rapping it's Ill/ Hill Street Blues 
 Striving, nigga with one side 
 Don't go against totally rent shit, nigga, baby gonna die 
 Yeah, bank robbers armored up, gear like the boys in Heat 
 De Niro told one soul to keep quiet 
 Aiyo, word to mother 
 Y'all niggas better bring yaselfs son, word 
 When Pun was packing a mack in back of the Acura 
 I was dealing in them buildings, it wasn't no cameras 
 The witness savages, snitching was hazardous, now it isn't 
 Shit is embarrassing, fuck a flow, this is a lyrical aqua duct 
 Sink or swim for what I'm hearing you bagging up 
 Lyte like the MC, I'm 'Paper Thin', you tripping 
 I'm taking trips, your eyes don't lie, take a glimpse into my life 
 You see me blazing clips with the green to make it rich 
 With a team that'll scrape the Knicks and a V that's crazy quick 
 I came to wear my Yankee fitted, represent for greatness 
 It's lyrical elevation, causing mental stimulation 
 If I'm getting too deep, I give you a minute to take in 
 My jewels radiant, like a view of the Caymans 
 And thinking you seeing me, who you playing with? 
 Cor, Mega, raw forever 
 Fell back, pause, fell off? Never 
 Shaolin, what up? 
 Aiyo, listen giraffe neck niggas, I blast techs 
 Alejandro came through with the Mexican Aztecs 
 Rap smack niggas on a whole different aspect 
 Homey, owe me dough, that's how we fucked up his last check 
 Three train Saratoga, train stop, nigga been 
 Metro part with the plan, make major figures 
 Foul flagrant, two shots, give me the ball back 
 You got shot, get off my ball sack 
 You not hot, give me a call back, niggas is all whack 
 Super doopa stupid, get drugs and I fall back 
 Ain't a problem that the God can't handle 
 I set it off First Blood, Sean John Rambo 
 Who? 
 As you can see, I'm focused 
 Boot Camp for life, fuck the G.I. Joe shit 
 Boot Camp is the army, better yet a Navy 
 Marine Air Force Ones, nigga, the shit's crazy, don't play me"
156,Raekwon,hiphop,Rainy Dayz (Dalvin Remix),"(Blue Raspberry) These rainy days... 
 (Raekwon) Doin' this for nineteen ninety-six 
 Revolution is a trick, be aware 
 Verse One: Raekwon 
 Yo, yo, yo 
 I run with rich rap cats who run corners 
 They run through alleys, navy blue Bally's at the grand finale 
 Still in all, currency catches the eye of the youth 
 On top, playin' on three corners of the roof 
 So we accept that, jettin at nights 
 Don't ever wet that, drop the G-pack how will I eat black 
 And brothers, flexin labels like cables 
 White Sables, pressin up, tryin' to make a debut 
 Hard times, when the God rhyme, I maim the minds 
 Because he playin' mines close 
 We ain't related 'cause he raided mine 
 They see me lampin up in 850's 
 With 360's, blowin' like 160 sellin fifties 
 Due to the wicked, dice should never lie 
 Now that's a damn lie, provin on standby, man why? 
 The game, I mentally tear down the brain 
 Half of us'll feel the pain, big boy, let it rain 
 I guess my whole team is marvelous 
 Street life novelist, let it rain dunn, swallow this 
 Word up, so you know 
 When I take you there you just add on to this (let it rain dunn, swallow this) 
 Chorus: Raekwon (singing) 
 You know how to love me 
 Makes me feel so good (let it rain let it rain) 
 You know how to -- you know how to love me *laughter* 
 Makes me feel so good -- Flex my voices right, it's on knowhatI'msayin? 
 Verse Two: Raekwon the Chef 
 Guess down, the crazy new appar' just for the new year 
 Wavy hair plus, we get much 'cause we on the air 
 Cristal whylin my medallion, stylin it's like city island 
 Relax kid, while shorty profilin 
 Until then, we got to bend with the wind 
 Plus build again, writin my friends sendin 'em linen tims 
 I'm tired of robberies, pornography 
 Throw a pair, Wally's on poach for live nigga pho-tography 
 Chorus: Raekwon (singin') 
 You know how to love me 
 Makes me feel so good 
 Verse Three: Ghostface Killer 
 Yo, yo 
 Check out the handshake fake niggaz rockin' the toupee 
 Frontin on me and Chef, yo it's dog day 
 Afternoon I'm blowin' up your weak platoon 
 Leave you helpless, screamin from all types of wounds 
 I be the expert, blowin' like a firework 
 Covertin concepts that will nerve-wreck in concert 
 'Cause I write, and blast and slash your whole level 
 I'm holy God I be challengin pros for gold medals 
 Whatever, still remain sturdy like a leather 
 On Friday's, get your fresh pay, from a better 
 Represent, my lifestyle is in like Flynn 
 Mili-tinted God shit is very masculine 
 Mad tuff, Razor bust stuff with nuff said 
 Ex-dust said, now puttin' heads to bed 
 Call me a legend, flexin with the style of old 
 Carryin loads of loot, mad rich buryin gold 
 Sabotage, thoughts of livin' large any day now 
 The land to satisfy the whole garage 
 Back to the morrow, soon to make a novel 
 Born to be, sellin like Marvel Comic books for my survival 
 Beware, I'm hittin like a snare from the Delphonics 
 Crushin niggaz I be blowin' like egg-onomics 
 Washed up, you're fuckin' with a daily error 
 No fat, niggaz be jettin when they face terror 
 Check it out y'all, all the fly chicks, yeah 
 Check it out yo, all the fly chicks, you know I dig your back out 
 Word up word up but check it out it's still china 
 Word up, one time y'all

 Uh, expensive things, diamond rings and things 
 You know, rap life, rap life, say what, ah, uh 
 Rap niggaz, we dippin' individuals 
 Some of us be frontin', some of us is really criminals 
 Swimmin' in the women and money we never had, it's sad 
 Rap could turn a good nigga bad 
 But not Catash though; I gaffle respect with no hassle 
 I'm still the same nigga, light skinded, curly afro 
 What's up though? I'm still the same nigga, a superfreak 
 I blow a g a week; catch me burnin' rubber up the street 
 Rap niggaz always smokin' indo 
 So every time we puff it's twenty dollars out the window 
 But what is friends fo'? We gonna blow that dough regardless 
 My niggaz live the life, and they ain't even rap artists 
 Rap money - we get that shit and blow it 
 We trick thirty g's and ain't got shit to show for it 
 Let me get that case of Moet, let me get that CLK 
 Let me get that ounce of bomb from my man from East L.A. 
 Let me get that 
 Rap niggaz get money, press up and get hundreds 
 Be like all them niggaz on it 
 Which side rock the most; it don't matter 'cause it get notes 
 Meet you on the left side of the boat 
 Coast, drivin' it most; we like where them niggaz go 
 We like everywhere; party where the fans go 
 It's all rap hype, young black niggaz - that's mad hype 
 Got ya station in a smash right 
 (Tash) 
 My Likwit niggaz made a killin' 
 We dropped three albums and got the whole world dancin' on the ceilin' 
 So I'm feelin' like the villain that cracked that safe's combo 
 My nigga had some hos; I told him shoot 'em through my condo 
 He shot 'em through; they peeped my CD through 
 They startin' askin' questions, but fuck the interview 
 What y'all really want to do? They said: ""pop the cryst'."" 
 I said: ""You like rap? Well wrap ya mouth around this!"" 
 Rap niggas, young niggaz ballin' 
 We on the motorcyles doin' ninety down my hall and 
 With the gold chain swingin', fallin' to the street 
 This rap life got us buyin' shit we don't need 
 We don't need the jet skis, but let's buy 'em just to try 'em 
 We splashin' out the Lex and got all the ladies eyein' 
 Us now, and we don't fuck around with no wife 
 'Cause all my niggaz is livin' the rap life 
 (Raekwon) 
 First of all, before we move on 
 Shit is like a Yukon, son 
 Slide shit on like Grey Poupon 
 Mergin' in the suburbs 
 Gettin' raw with greenery herb 
 Real ill niggaz smack birds 
 Fat words showin' proof how my gat work - go shoot, kill 
 Smack a blackbird, jettin' in an AC-herse 
 Big Jim stay grinnin' in a six, spinnin' it, kid 
 Nigga who flex, Lex threw ten in him 
 Stand posin', blowin' shit, coast from east and west 
 We rockin' our vest, cannon might roast you 
 High powered hydrolic Eddie Bauer rockwilder 
 Who wilder? Slang bit niggas on the collar 
 Amp might blow 
 I might land, set up shop, and glow 
 Shinin' like a lamp post, my camp post 
 Cream leather green leaves forever 
 Goin' to do whatever 
 Corns and crab niggaz - they roll together 
 What up tash? Black hash, we invented the spaz 
 High like sixteen niggaz over ten bags 
 Real niggas gon' ride 
 Fake niggaz gon' slide 
 Check the next issue, faggot, in the vidibe 
 (Tash) 
 Rap drama, the drama never calms 
 I be on the celly phone, trippin' off my baby moms 
 Try na make her understand I get paid to rhyme 
 I don't show up at your job, so don't show up at mine! 
 'Cause there's no biz like show biz if y'all niggaz ask me 
 Show money, that's like pimpin' 'cause we get it tax free 
 Catch a check for thirty-three, cut straight from SRC 
 Take it straight to any counter, cash my shit with no I.D. 
 Rap women - they always be around us 
 'Cause we from out of town, and they be lovin' out-of-towners 
 Wash up in motherfuckas like a TV evangelist 
 'Cause they from where they from, and we straight from Los Angeles

 With loud phones, system, 100 thousand watts in em 
 Rock rocks, delight exchange like stocks 
 Bars made like Comstock, dead man's glock 
 Holdin' name down, spit a 100 in change now 
 Range spin out, damn check The Weather Channel 
 Throw the Gilligan on, just strain now, smack lames down 
 Fuckin' with checks, throw the ringer on and blink out 
 Link out, how the fuck this money come up short? 
 What? You sniffed a half a quart? 
 Dart designer, emblem blow, seat recliner, rewind 
 Black caught an old timer, gold miner 
 Spread love to golden glove, foamed up 
 Blood, hibernatin with snubs, never rock Lugz 
 Chill, run tracks like Harriette Tub' 
 Bugs, spit cum all in ya girlfriend's mug 
 Motion picture novel, Donna giones' third brother 
 What? Bout to buy estate floodin with clubs 
 Wrapper around me, what's in my lap could seem astoundin 
 Broke, but with no hands gone, sleep but soundly 
 It's cold water, rotti tried to drown me 
 You and ya boys surround me 
 Meet the sleeper, static-free Downy 
 Slang, wildin up, the nigga found me 
 Sick gowns, rock a sick gown, 4-5th brown 
 Ready to pop shit now 
 The Earth spinnin like a windmill 
 Workin ya swords, get ya link down 
 Hit down, cavalry ain't shit now 
 Valerie, number one asian, ancient from the pink cows 
 Now we know how the fuck you think now 
 Take off a nugget ring and think how 
 Bullet tank out

 Commerical rap niggaz get they domes smacked outta

 Cowards, you gonna learn to respect power 
 We burn by the hour, one burst the remmy got us

 Roll up, based on dollars, baseball hat, big collar 
 Chill, watch everybody crowd us, we 'bout it bouters 
 Rockwilders, rockin' swim towelers 
 Burst the 45 power, skate across the Isenhower 
 Kangol, 50 iguana, nugget trimmed, ice down iguana 
 Split it in half, holdin' my anaconda

 Stashed in Ghana, guns about the size of ya mama, select drama

 Yo 'Ye whattup

 You got stacks like the international house of pancakes 
 All alone ready to phone me and your hand shakes 
 Palms is sweat it, don't regret 
 Never the walk miles for love I sit at starters deck 
 It just happens I was floating you seen it captain? 
 Blinked at me then I threw on my thinking cap 
 Taker, and then we can slide to Jamaica 
 Shopping for a year or two stop in Diego 
 It's obvious I'm gon sue your mommy is 
 We just friends so she can't Clyde Bonnie us 
 Fly walls down in the fly halls 
 Come to the master suite leave every piece in the master hall 
 All about money tied in a know stand over there 
 That's why I make it happen on blocks 
 Brazil cut sweater, Audi, leather 
 Playing the field tryna outslug Berretta 
 You see my baby over hit the road 
 Where she's going I swear nobody knows 
 I need to find her before another man does 
 I wouldn't want him to steal my love 
 I'm just tryin' to be cool, cool, cool (tryn'a be cool) 
 What would you expect me to do (oh oh oh, oh oh oh, yeah) 
 I'm just tryin' to find, find, find 
 That sweet love of mine

 Where is my runway love

 Last name West and my teeth Diamonds 
 She said yo what's your occupation, crazy rhyming? 
 Listen to Wu Tang 
 Trying crazy suits on 
 Stuntin' in our high top Louie's 
 Shorts is the coogies 
 Open up the door when you take her to the movies 
 When you meet the parents you tell De Niro 
 Her boyfriend is zero she needs to cut the weirdo 
 Next show they gotta up the zeroes 
 Nobody rocking like this sixty years old 
 The hard johns and the Walleys something caught me 
 I'm telling you what Wu-Tang taught me 
 The young youth rocking the gold tooth 
 Pull up in a drop top old school bumping the cash rules 
 No question we the reason why the summers blazin' 
 You looking good fly color Asian 
 Ra I give it yo ya, no trivia 
 She used to roll with my G-unit like Olivia 
 Till she caught me getting numbers not her's 
 (Sweet runaway love) 
 Guess that's the day she became a runaway love 
 I'm runnin' outta time 
 Where is my runaway love 
 Searching low and high 
 Know that I'm not givin' up 
 I give it all up for her 
 I'll never be enough 
 I won't stop until I find 
 My runaway love 
 Why can't I find, the love of mine, 
 When you're standing in front of my face 
 Oh why (oh why), You must be mine 
 How did I let you get away 
 Leave it up to the most high sit in a ghost fly 
 Chillin' with two of my brothers we both live on deck 
 Grabbing 'em on set 
 This is how we roll independence she a go I'm gon go get 
 Take that queen assure to ya 
 We can live every month baby girl just call me up 
 Waking up mess in some cold sweats thinking of this the video tapes 
 Even the stress 
 My mind is a terrible thing to waste 
 No love lost I know I'm going crazy I can't floss 
 Me my lady left my homies 
 It's all baloney just like rocking an old pony 
 So when I chillin' I'm just lost no more feeling 
 I need my honey in my life get that film it 
 Take the time Rae Just and Ye shine 
 My runaway love give me mine come on 
 I'm runnin' outta time 
 Where is my runaway love 
 Searching low and high 
 Know that I'm not givin' up 
 I give it all up for her 
 I'll never be enough 
 I won't stop until I find 
 My runaway love 
 I'm runnin' outta time 
 Where is my runaway love 
 Searching low and high 
 Know that I'm not givin' up 
 I give it all up for her 
 I'll never be enough 
 I won't stop until I find 
 My runaway love"
160,Raekwon,hiphop,Run,"Pss, yo, yo, yo (yo son roll!) 
 Oh shit, yo, yo, run! 
 Aiyo, I jumped from the 8th floor step, hit the ground 
 The pound fell, cops is coming 
 Runnin' through the pissy stairwells, I ain't hear nothin' 
 Buggin', only thing I remember was the bullshit summon 
 So I stopped at the 2nd floor, ran across, cracks is fallin' 
 My pockets is lean, clean when I vanished off 
 Took off, made track look easy 
 The walkie talkies them D-E-T's had, black, they was rated P.G. 
 Run, I will not give up, no, quick flag the car down 
 Take me to, Ghost here they come now! 
 Er! Pull off quick, back up, hit the bitch, dog 
 Turned down Hill, light the Marley spliff 
 Run! I will not get bagged on the rock 
 Run! I seen what happened to Un, they bad with they cops 
 Run! They am' shit, plan shit, destroy evidence 
 Fuck a case, I'm not comin' home when I'm fifty six 
 Die with the heart of Scarface and take fifty licks 
 Before I let these crackers throw me and shit 
 Bounce if you a good kid, bounce, do the bird hop 
 Curse, swerve to get served, these cocksuckers got nerve 
 Heard I was killin' shit, they must got word 
 That I told the chief on Rich Port I don't wanna merge 
 I skated through the back of the building, hit the steps up 
 Ran up in Kay crib, lay daddy rest 
 I had to break free, police on me and they F-B's 
 Yelling ""I think his name Lex, that's his aunt, freeze"" 
 That's when I hit the window, indo' coming out the back room 
 Boom, Pretty and his man, Black Caesar 
 Damn, they saw me and they bustin' at me 
 Cab just missed me, plus them goochie frames, foul, that's six fifty 
 Stop back at suite, them leaf defense slid through my man garden 
 Yelled out 'pardon', kept it moving, peace 
 Build be gone, ain't no honor amongst thieves 
 Please, plus they heard I'm getting Parmesan cheese 
 And I won't stop moving till the metal dig me 
 Say word, yo, make 'em work for it, young rookie, y'all need me 
 That's when it is, what it is, if it's that or the cup 
 But in the ill gangstas book what they niggas do is 
 Run! If you sell drugs in the school zone 
 Run! If you gettin' chased with no shoes on 
 Run! Fuck that! Run! Cops got, guns! 
 They givin' out life like by the tons 
 Run! If you ain't do shit, you it 
 That next felony, nigga, it's like three zip 
 So, run! Hop fences, jump over benches! 
 When you see me comin' get the fuck out the entrance! 
 Run! Fuck that! Run! Cops got guns! 
 Ah-hah! I might gotta take my shirt off (yeah, kid) 
 I like that one (uh-huh, go in, go in!) 
 Yo, uh, it's Task Force Tuesday, the NARCS is in the black car 
 I got five hundred, hundred packs in my backyard 
 Clear twelve-twelve's, that look like stuff shells 
 I'm cuttin' niggas throats on the sails, while they puff L's 
 Don't leave nothin' unbagged, shave everything 
 I learned from the O.G.'s to save everything (to save everything) 
 They come by one more time, they gon' hop out 
 They two deep, and one is a bitch, she gettin' knocked out 
 Then I can get rid of the pack 
 But I just copped this pretty chrome thing, so I'm dippin' with that 
 Uh, down-shiftin' on 'em like I got gears on me 
 (Run!) Besides that, I got about 5 years on me 
 (Run!) Scared to death, runnin' like I got bears on me 
 (Run!) My Timb's start feelin' like they Nike Air's on me 
 (Run!) It's hard for me to slow down, it's like I'm on the throughway 
 My belt's in the crib on the floor by my two-way 
 Now I'm try'nna hold my hammer up, and my pants too 
 If they don't kill me, they gon' give me a number I can't do 
 Rather it be the streets, then jail where I die at 
 And I'm asthmatic, so I'm lookin' for somewhere to hide at 
 But they too close, and I got this new toast 
 'Magine if I would have let off a shot or two, you know what I gotta do 
 Free hold east coast whole, boxing the Philly down 
 Down to Dela', when y'all rarely toting the milli round 
 I bring the milli to ya house, I was just down south 
 Carolina had the milli down there 
 Pearl Beach had the heater in reach, and four freaks 
 In Hooters, I made 'em lose it when they heard freedom of speech 
 Told them freaks that I gotta run, I'm on the run 
 But they tried to make me stay, they showed me two hooters a piece 
 I stayed for a second but you know I gotta skate 
 It's like a race, cops chase me, I'm chasing the moon 
 Before I left the premise, saw two more bitches 
 They told me they was witches, told me hop on they broom 
 I did, and then we went zoom 
 Don't you know them witches got me outtie wit the quickness 
 I'm buggin', I'm trippin' in reality I'm skitzin' 
 The cops got me trapped in the Audi wit the Smith and 
 D-Boy, yeah, Birdman Jr. in ya building, people 
 I'm a let you know how it go on my side of the mountain, whoadie 
 It's sure about does that you heard me 
 And I dropped in effect since 9/11 
 I'm on the avenue with nines, elevens, I'm a two times felon 
 That's why I keep the top up, on my 9-11 
 Pele, in New Orleans, ain't got no Rico law 
 So I keep that heat in the car, but they don't know 
 I had that 'dro in the seat of the car 
 But it's hot right now, so you can see me tomorrow 
 Ay, Ghostface, the youngins on the block duckin' blue and red lights 
 While your boy bypassing fare light 
 But if them cock suckers ever get me dead right 
 Three hots and the cops swallow weed and a knife, right? 
 I speed at night, take it easy in the day 
 Go hard wit the dough, take it easy wit the yae 
 Yup, Lil' Weezy, I get my loot up 
 But at the pull up, come, I say my crew run run, boy"

 Fuck around and poison one of y'all, Cristal 
 New shit, havd your mother on the bottle wildin'

 Say 'I be got dammit they done changed the rules 
 The common denominator, the nigga numerator 
 Never know who the hater, niggaz cater to your ego 
 I'm sorry like Atari whose the cousin to Coleco, Vision 
 Caught a Rico, back on the street like Chico, DeBarge 
 He large and got a 'Llac in the garage 
 Few parts here and there, I declare hard, my lawd 
 One at Clark, one at Spellman 
 Both know each other and it's cool, you can tell when 
 He step off in the party women jump for joy 
 But all the wild niggas schemin' they gon' jump the boy 
 For spittin' all that bourgeois, my watch, my car 
 I'm a star, I'd rather be a comet by far 
 Deliver this through your audio, ghetto mafioso 
 Grow hydro, then bag it up yo 
 Price that longevity, suggest make moves 
 Slow take time grow eight, react nine blow 
 Hydro slide raw like fuck Renaldo 
 Fly ride though, shit lookin' wild dope 
 Then glide yo, flippin' the page, I go 
 Watch five-oh, jump on my meat, ride slow 
 Watch those, undercovers, cop those, rock those, glocks blows 
 Leave 'em baggy and collect spot grows 
 Keep a watch froze, lean on the yacht and wash clothes 
 Let the chop' blow, bag a half a block plot grows, what? 
 Boi, I bust raps like D-boys bust gats, shit 
 We the type of people that don't bury the axe 
 Or the hatchet, every time we see your link we snatch it 
 Ridin' round our hood talking that dumb shit, your cabbage 
 Is cracked, like plumber's ass, and summer's grass 
 I been in the game for a minute, seen some suckers like y'all passin' 
 Thinkin' you're light skinned, all right then, lil' boy why you frightened? 
 The Dungeon Family gon' be here nigga so keep writing 
 I gotta hit The Source, I need my other half a mic 
 Because that ""Southerplayalisticadillacmuzik"" was a classic, right! 
 College Park, East Pointe and Decatur they got my back, so 
 We gon' keep on jammin' and stabbin' off in the track, 
 Think it's time to bungee but buddy we will be back 
 And I'm fin' to put some D's on the 'Llac, know dat!"

 Damn, your lovin' got me tranked out, the handkerchief out 
 We walk the bank route

 Using your mind, that's the jewel of life 
 Science is right 
 Walking the righteous path 
 Peace God, love you mad 
 So when you're zonin from the head start we blessin your heart 
 Peace, I'm outta here girl, check out the best part

 Never have I been so mystified by anyone's love before 
 Hey, I feel so natural 
 I keep comin' back for more 
 And each time we touch you open up a new door 
 Baby you're such a midnight tease 
 It's gonna take everything to keep you from me, hey 
 And the joy that your lovin' brings 
 Can separate the mountains from the sea 
 I don't want to be wrong 
 But it feels right 
 If loving you is so wrong 
 I don't want to go on 
 I don't want to be wrong 
 But it feels right 
 It feels good 
 So good, so good, so good 
 Spent so many nights believing I was wrong for you bein in my life 
 I can't ignore it when some say that it ain't right 
 (It ain't right) 
 I decided you're the best thing that happened in my life 
 I haven't had everything, oh no 
 But you come close to everything that love means, hey yeah 
 In heaven's eyes love is embraced between you and I 
 Now that we have each other I don't have to dream"

 Shoot off your kangol, while you in the plane, fronting 
 Stop, admire me, y'all should of fired me

 Tied his broken arm to his Hush Puppies 
 Wrapped around trauma, everything realer than fuck

 Three young Italians, suited down personal style

 Felt like some crackers was in back of me 
 Spit on the clerk, pass the Harry Winston set 
 Ghost backing me

 Sick bars deep in this language 
 Did I tell you how my day's spent? 
 Speaking through the face of Ronald Regan 
 Iceberg History, calligraphy 
 Colidescope colors, hollow-head shells and flaring gunmen 
 Hate to see me coming like gray skies on day of judgment 
 Makes you wonder where the love went 
 Hit a nigga, feed him to some buzzards 
 Put up numbers, plus I'm one to push his mug in 
 We duck in the safe, check what I'm hugging 
 Rocks the size of some shit, out in the congo 
 My arms full, let's get the fuck out, Busta I got you

 Marciano brought a chisel wit an ice pick 
 Princess cuts, invisible settings 
 Planning the world's greatest diamond heist playin' a tune by Otis Redding 
 Icicle cones hang from the ceiling just like stalagmites 
 Time to throw on a skully and tying a rag tight 
 Throwing light went off and in the basket 
 Grabbed the necklace from off the satin pillow while the glass casket 
 Ice lay across the crushed burgandy velvet 
 Up in the diamond slide-tray 
 Gun in your face, slide it right away 
 Roundtable with Habib, Mirishnokof, and the rest of them Jewish niggas 
 We got them niggas drunk and talking foolish see 
 You know the way we straight manipulated the shit 
 We swindle them niggas for all their precious things before we skated and shit 
 Yeah, y'all niggas know we skated early 
 Disguised ourselves as the cidic Jews and even left my sideburns curly 
 Bounce to Mexico and spend some pesos 
 And bury the diamonds on an island your never heard

 Son don't know that it's real 
 Coming looking like he about peel something 
 In a tight jam, red down, matching like Santa 
 If I could just reach my hammer 
 He bust two shots, I played mice 
 Ran to the spot were the sun was at, quickly he was blinded by the ice 
 That's when Rae ran out of the back 
 Towel on, soap on his arms, spit duke around, fell on my lap 
 (Raekwon) 
 Yo, what the fuck happened? 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 It was a set up to get wet up 
 (Raekwon) 
 Starks your bleeding 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Nah, his blood fucked my white leather up 
 Ten G's down the drain 
 Yo hurry up, we got to get him up 
 Get the sheets son, let's fix him up 
 Lock the door, turn the TV off, your kicks is near the light switch 
 (Raekwon) 
 Just give me two minutes to iron my shirt, find my ices 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 The hit came quick 
 Hit the jack, star six 
 Ghost 
 (Raekwon and Ghostface Killah) 
 Put down the phone stupid 
 Wipe off your prints 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Rae ran hysterically 
 Slipped on soap 
 Landed on his back, with his gat, now that's dope 
 We got three minutes, nobody seen shit 
 Somebody might have heard shit 
 Singing on some Martin, were my momma bird shit 
 Fuck your socks, that's when we heard the door knock 
 Everything all right? Partying son, balloons popped 
 Threw this dude under the bed 
 A half dressed Raekwon, swallowing diamonds 
 Had money in juice up on his wedding day 
 The phone rang off, the tea kettle blew, wifey hitting me, 
 What you want sweaty, Lima beans and kidney 
 Trashed the beeper, slowly I reached for the reefer 
 Throw a Costa, peep oh son the house keeper 
 Soap suds dripping from his nuts, cut up gut 
 Praying how me make it out the telly and touch 
 (Chorus: Ghostface Killah) 
 Fuck it, a Wesley Snipes movement on a Sunday in Bermuda 
 We laptop niggas, thugs in a computer 
 Caught up in the grimy shit 
 Finding two days later a murder and we got to make this flight shit 
 It was a Wesley Snipes movement on a Sunday in Bermuda 
 We laptop niggas, thugs in a computer 
 A Wesley Snipes movement on a Sunday in Bermuda 
 We laptop niggas, thugs in a computer 
 (Raekwon) 
 Hey yo, the pressures on, sonny got murk 
 Its time to move fast 
 Hey yo, Deini it's on, check out the news flash 
 Flew out the next day, back to the Tony estates 
 Blew on the first class flight to L.A. 
 It ain't take long, I pulled a few strings on the horn 
 So were it came from? 
 That nigga we stuck and took the caine from 
 We should have killed him when we had him 
 Yo I was holding a Magnum 
 Yeah we bagged him, but we let him slide in the wagon 
 His bad little brown ho, from out Chicago 
 She move his cargo, good at handling Roscoes 
 We had our eyes closed God, we should have seen it coming 
 He should have seen me coming, running out the shower gunning 
 Now that I figured it, she put the waiter on 
 It all came to me, in back of my mind, just like my favorite song 
 Dawned on me later on 
 By then the day was gone 
 How dare this nigga even think that he could take us on 
 Smoke the Cee Allah 
 Sent the kite through the Pens 
 Him and big Dan 
 Known to split wigs, with razor sharp gems 
 Giants from Attica riots 
 Halls is quiet 
 CO's with babies on their arms look tight 
 And this nigga from down state got shipped up north 
 Stocky young fella, running his lips on how he set it off 
 Then heard that shit, plus got that kite 
 Money got murdered in his bunk that night"

 She givin' me some credit for clothes 
 That's the slang work for bricks, dicks 
 Analyze you never know who lookin' 
 It's deranged world, wit snitches is enterprisin'

 What's the prognosis: drugs, guns, and ounces of Gold fish 
 Fly reefer out-town, bitches is stone six 
 And birds back in 18 and played C.R.E.A.M 
 Gray beam, it's lean new A.D.I.D.A.S 
 Jackets, flippin' up small dean 
 Visualisin' portraits, fresh cuts 
 Brand new Porsche's 
 Going wit hand-to-hand, servin' the Source

 This day-today lifestyle where niggaz get arraigned 
 And get chain, it's like cycle blao! 
 Drug Dealers, Star and Celebrities (Ghetto Celebs)

 Shit is all hood till they hear the heat cock (Whooo!) 
 Fall back and let the beat rock

 Degrees of experience qualifies me to speak in certain areas 
 Where many can't reach, so I prepared a speech for y'all 
 To then listen while I spit the hot venomous shit 
 My whole Clique sick, infested wit the itchy trigger finger mob related 
 Noodle-leanie universal flag Beanie 
 Son you wouldn't want to see me black down, master .4 pound 
 Clip full of hallow tip round 
 Turn the fuckin' sound up 
 My cup runneth over Hennessey, the Bill Bixby 
 Ninja Scroll, niggaz that roll 
 My son did four in the hole 
 Tenant population, neva told, facin' Parole 
 Sipped the old gold style, beat it in trial 
 My mild-mannered .9 Bandit, flow drunk 
 Look at Skunk weed stickin' 
 Razor sharp rip 'em, bites lift 'em 
 We at the Jam direct 
 The Ghetto Gospel, collaboration 
 One word could change the nation 
 No doubt!

 Tuna Salad and Puma rackin' he's 
 Pushin' through the projects, captain 
 Get your money, yo show me no slackin' 
 We drive the meanest Joints 
 Shoot through Medina wit a Evisu Jeans and Nina's 
 Stop by Juniors we hittin' cheeba 
 Briefly, crackers observe 
 You got the undercovers 
 Niggas just love us, we know they suckers 
 You know what? What? Mosey don't be nosey yo! 
 Watch these fake niggaz wit these Thank You cards 
 Them shits is bogey 
 Snitches in the hood up to no good 
 We would kill a lot of Motherfuckers but the timin' ain't good 
 So while my bankroll climbin' 
 I be out on consignment, breezin' 
 Ki's wit 29 letter melted cheeses 
 All of my papers now in real estate 
 White folks been doin' this since '69 
 It's billions and killer weight 
 So prosperous moves wit the jewels, wit Wu Nikes on 
 It's cool don't ever act like niggaz ain't who new 
 One! 
 Yeah! we just sit back, in the luxury toasters 
 Slidin' through the motherfuckin' projects 
 Stand away from you fake ass Motherfuckers 
 Layin' out in the barber shops, gettin' fucked up cuts 
 We don't respect y'all (Don't respect y'all)

 Pete Rock, Masta Killa, The Vatican 
 One! I'm gone"
170,Raekwon,hiphop,The Red Carpet,"I set it off in the sunny distance, no days existed 
 My patience led the way until the greatest love listened to me 
 I used to play the witness, wait in the trenches 
 It's like the sixth man, sits on different benches 
 It's hard squeezing life in a sentence 
 And if I do, roll carpet with the red tint 
 My entrance is what's between 
 When I exit, it's Evidence left on the scene 
 Alchemist cut the record down to the bone 
 And with a record like this I take the world by storm 
 Sky blessed, the land of the brave 
 Understand where I stand, my hand is made 
 From B R double-O K-lyn in the planet 
 Family landed, managed to raise the man that I became 
 Panic on my first campaign, but when the words fell to place 
 I was certain to reign, I hit the purple, 
 Then step in the circle and start flexin' 
 Weatherman invented, now storms change directions 
 Portions of my proceeds is feeding my homies now 
 I always shared pretty good for an only child 
 I was the baby boy, I could do no wrong 
 Now the role's reversed, I'm putting people on 
 They on welfare, you got health care 
 They used to have their priorities elsewhere 
 I took rims and tires and traded them 
 For a ticket to an island, that's where 
 I wrote this rhyming where I first saw my vision 
 Buy a better living, a place to raise kids in 
 So I think like I rule the world 
 On the brink of something bigger, building schools 
 For boys and girls the thought of home gets me out of my bed 
 I said you got them tools? 
 Get them shits up out of the shed, come on 
 I'm like the interstate of rhyming the Jack Dempsey emcee 
 All my shit costumed out eventually money is made, fly blades 
 A woman with brains, a black nigga reign 
 My lifestyle as a prowler a rich owner, loaner 
 Used to pump at coffees shops had my bitch 
 Who sell with me rolling up fly ass and still classy 
 Asking questions like, ""Why you wait on that glass? 
 Why you splash me?"" Yo, it's only nigga shit 
 I'mma teach you like how I was taught too 
 Hold the phone, ward two, seeing all kinds of great fossils 
 Colossal juice, ? the house, act fly 
 Got you, no need to walk backwards, fuck with the taxes 
 I speak credibility, the story to másses 
 Yo, a diplomatic winner, Nike boots 
 A scully good denim jean on and? 
 They say you only live once, I disagree 
 You only live twice, your life enable your seed's 
 So I lean on blacks and feed 'em the deeds 
 So when I die they got a foundation on my publishing B 
 Plus the words that I speak, plus my family jewels 
 It ain't all blood diamonds, but ? experienced fools 
 And I be rhyming cool, but my philosophy's deep 
 Like a dear John letter, so read 'em and weep 
 And the wolf smells blood, you can feed 'em to me 
 We can meet in the street, draw heat, but what happened to peace? 
 He got a Dirty Sanchez, like what happened to Screech 
 Jesus, diarrhea, I mean holy shit 
 Christ on a cracker, that's just how we spit 
 Communion had the wine, made the sign of the cross 
 And I will live in the past, chalk it up as a loss 
 Went from ""Please listen to my demo!"" to stretch limo 
 To the pen in a cell watching Eminem on Jimmy Kimmel 
 But I can't go out like Timbo slice 
 Like Geena Korrano, a cyborg determinate 
 Mano a mano, still Ronald McDonald over one billion served 
 But it's up to me to get what I deserve 
 So I handle my biz and hustle harder than the norm 
 Early bird get the worm, but the hawk gets the bird"

 Darts that'll splatter through faces, taste niggaz hearts 
 I'm intellectual, plus professional 
 And Walbaums to vegetables 
 Shit is right here, like buyin' fly gear 
 Dare any white man or fan nigga, ran through niggaz 
 Blew shotties in niggaz lobbies, the grand RZA 
 We left, the radio broke, I yoke my vocals, hittin' green smoke 
 Allah Math', show me when the needle broke 
 Numb the whole crowd up, stupid ass Loud fouled up 
 Never knew what they had, now they proud of us 
 Picture my vision, precision, lines jumpin' out of commission 
 Divine got me, nigga, the boss, he pop me

 Buy jets and vehicles, steal a little 
 Wrap up the whole rap government

 Walk wit, I slap your boss wit it 
 Navy blue, New York fitted, I'm cold frost bitted

 Blocks is hot, feel the shot from fourth/fifth it 
 With no regard for your boulevard, just the shit bag and bullet scar 
 It's the Riddler, riddle me this, riddle me that 
 Who the pretender? And who the door man that let them enter? 
 The Wu-Tang, 36 Cham', what you smokin'? 
 Got you in the game chokin', like Van Gundy coachin' 
 Your street team, bunch of weaklings 
 Don't ever let me catch your reachin' 
 Respect when a grown man is speakin' 
 Shh, keep on sleepin', and just like TLC, I keep on ""creepin"" 
 The five percent of y'all, keep on teachin' 
 The heat seakin', missile official, that got issues 
 Like Funk Doc got snot tissue, it's Hott Nikkels 
 ""Everywhere I turn, I see, your face, but you're never there""

 Shh... shit ain't over... 
 Okay, now, same shit, different day, grindin', gettin' paid 
 Self at it, automatic, guns that spit and spray 
 Gotta have it, ass grab it, time to slip and weight 
 Godbody, House your Party, watch the Kid N Play 
 Y'all gon' make me go postal, up in this muthafucka house 
 Full of bloodsuckers and hoes that love hustlers 
 Roll that izza, pour me another kizza 
 Bigga, to my nigga, so drunk they can't get up 
 Shotguns through nose, hot ones through foes 
 Let the herb spots run till the cops come, suppose 
 I was just another stick in the mud, on a Saturday 
 Thinkin', how I'mma get the fifth in the club 
 See my crew thick, everyday I fights to prove it 
 We comes undisputed, with batteries included 
 Honey's ""bee"" like Meth, I be like what? 
 They want some free CD's, I'm like ""see these"" nuts

 If y'all muthafuckas gettin' high tonight, say all right, haha 
 If y'all muthafuckas gettin' drunk tonight, say all right, haha

 Catch me in a crisp blue six, deep dish 
 Doors is crisp, velour stop at the wrist 
 Watch is involved, talk to me Trick Daddy 
 I liked the way you tilt ya hat up in that Caddy son, 
 Can't believe you the most slept on 
 Took a break since the Cuban, niggas lookin' like you just repped wrong 
 You done slimmed down a bit, got caught with the hammer 
 Steal banners, medical examiners, clocked live hammers 
 For real, you a live nigga, rock ya five in ya slippers 
 Like them other five guys in ya picture 
 Come on, watch, I'm the star of the show, so blow then 
 Mothafucka, you ain't blew in three years 
 You son of a bitch, that's why I rock the big shit 
 Don't forget who you is, nigga, you my little shit 
 I will crush you to pieces, stop ya heart from tickin' 
 And you mad 'cause you a older clock, couple rocks missin' 
 And my Breitling--the band: you can say it's iced lightning 
 You don't like him, do you? You wanna fight him 
 In fact, I should've put you back, relaxed on the stones 
 And copped the two-thousand leather in snow cones 
 A bowl of milk almost killed you, ak, you almost drowned in Pops 
 I bought another box, I'ma keep it real with you 
 And I'ma murder you if ya bitch-ass get on my nerves again

 My Wallos show off, go off like an alarm in the six 
 Draped in yellow and I'm still poppin'

 The devil is a lie 
 You ain't broke bread till you taste the devil's pie 
 They say his laugh sounds like an angel when he cries 
 What better camouflage when the halo's your disguise 
 Them wings don't fly 
 Your traitor is your neighbor 
 At your front porch, and he's handing you your paper 
 Bathrobe on, but the sword's underneath 
 And he wanna see your blood as it pours in the street 
 It's the mark of the beast 
 The meek shall inherit the Earth 
 The weak shall inherit the dirt 
 You each should have perished at birth 
 Still born or aborted 
 Every street tax gotta come with an audit 
 Either your life, or your loved ones 
 Straight razor or a snub-gun 
 From the village where the thugs from 
 Same corner that you copping all your drugs from 
 He a hero, but he unsung 
 I'm the one 
 I'm the one 
 Ayo homie, the chambers is 36, they new and improved 
 Now make a move 
 These guns whistle, sizzle up dudes who got big mouths, no power 
 Run in the bank with no dollars, got the nerve to switch crews 
 We better than the rest of 'em, my guess is the estrogen 
 And all the money we got, remove like the Mexicans 
 A cartel, compound, a carvel, a large scale in Scarsdale 
 I fuck with golf now, Shala is ill 
 Yeah, the coke is fresh, straight out of Bermuda yo 
 Or chilling on a beach in Boca, cheefin' with tuna 
 Salads and palaces, yo, we smoke out them chalices 
 Passing of the balances of bread to the Island since 
 1984, the (?) was just more 
 Then we would come trough with rifles rocking Nike boots and war 
 A real nigga's invention that came from a henchman 
 Who blew up, now throw the Wu up, that's my redemption 
 Drug dealer, been that nigga half my life 
 Drug dealer, been that nigga half my life 
 You niggas talking, but you ain't never seen 'em 
 Imagine being first name basis with the kingpin 
 God, I was Lucifer's neighbor 
 You wouldn't believe some of the things these people do for this paper 
 Moving with the lasers under Rugers 
 Make a move, you make the papers, lose lose situation 
 Sweat or blood, you get to choose what you bathe in 
 The chemists cookwork 
 The runners; footwork 
 The customs took work 
 The soldiers put work in 
 On any of the motherfuckers who fucked up good work 
 Bosses tell 'em: 'Good work' 
 That's just how the hood work 
 Northface bubble with, eight bundles under it 
 Gold front upper-lip smile while I was hugging it 
 I lied, I wasn't Lucifer's neighbor, he who I'm fucking with 
 My moms threw that snow in her nose, but I would hustle it 
 Champ hoodie, Mongoose with the bags 
 Clap your stoop up, hit moms duke in her legs 
 That's beef, y'all ain't street 
 Y'all peep, write it down and try to beat 
 Fucking everything, neck heavy swing 
 Second hand swepped across that pretty breathling 
 And then that Nissan, Honda, Chevy thing pendling 
 Whatever bring fetti in, steadily I fed my whole team 
 Drug dealer, been that nigga half my life 
 Drug dealer, been that nigga half my life 
 You niggas talking, but you ain't never seen 'em 
 Imagine being first name basis with the kingpin 
 In this art of war, my pen stroke is Picasso 
 To get the picture I ain't got to paint the nostrils 
 You know my origins is over when 
 Fat black bitch singing over organs 
 Die for a dollar, pride you don't swallow 
 You say that for the one you buying red bottoms 
 Yeah, that's the price you gotta pay for it 
 All's fair in love and war, she masquerade for it 
 Woo! Jack-O-Lantern Push 
 Trick or treat (?), I earned it of the books 
 Now listen to me vent 
 When you sitting watch, it's like the tires being spent 
 Shots from everywhere, but they never make a dent 
 Knight in shining armor 
 Mistake me for the villain cause of my vengeance is your karma 
 Yeah, fear is knowing you're a goner 
 This is music to my soul, 'cause it's death before dishonor

 Raised by a dirty preacher 
 That used the church money to cop a new Beamer 
 Got the heart of a child raised by a prostitute

 Popping pills got a nigga brain like a labyrinth 
 Called the ho on purpose 
 But I got the brain on accident 
 Nigga I'm your majesty 
 Show up with a bag of weed 
 Rolled a blunt so perfect, thought it came up out a factory 
 My manuscript leave a man ripped of all his dreams 
 The insomniac with nightmares in sixteens 
 I'm a wet dream, Dry sense of humor 
 Travel in Class like a high school rumor 
 No one really cares if you embarrass us with style 
 Cuzz when it comes to them raps you been letting us down 
 So tell 'em why your mad son 
 Gotta get it off your chest

 Jamaicans make bread, Cubans call him pop 
 Was a young O.G., considerate, fly gangsta anxious 
 His face is rude, that made him more dangerous 
 Went suddenly blind, he couldn't see faces 
 He rock glaciers, well known in strange places 
 Been killin' niggas, all ages 
 Paid his way up out of court cases, extortin mazes 
 Love stay greens, livin' in Queens 
 Cousin named Dahoom, who you, nigga I'm Team 
 Dressed real ill proper, when he locked up 
 Playin' the wall, one foot up, what, the kid was into soccer 
 Love family, nigga in Miami, right, Air Force's on 
 Four horses smokin' on china white, they bad 
 He had the Shaft look, and then he yell Rae 
 He had cribs hooked, he had nasty books 
 Him and his right hand, worth a hundred in the can 
 Little short Dominican, little Duran was fam 
 Eyes bloody, pop Vasine and he studied 
 Gave rides to me, dropped me and Old Earth in Brooklyn 
 I mean Brook-lan, a super crook don off the hook 
 He had the juks look, and he loves Benzes and gongs 
 Get wands, daddy, Yukon, grow up get on's daddy 
 Be sure, watch for, eat all that, daddy 
 Yeah, young'n's, supposed to marry 
 Don't play me close, kept the loot in his boats, he threw the toast at me 
 I wanted to be with him badly 
 Had me like a little nigga, runnin' with wolves, they all glow gladly 
 Heavenly, now he seventy, got rich representin' me 
 He won't throw me no cash, play pool, baby 
 I be like, ooh, no you didn't, baby, get drunk money 
 You'se a slick dude, baby, slip through, baby 
 Yeah, I'm on, makin' records now, I be gettin' money after you gone 
 He's a Don, slick Juan, Marijuan', Don Juan 
 Eatin' Caribbean food, feedin' me wrong 
 Breathe from the tongue, Chef you live 
 Make these niggas realize you gon' be number one 
 (Chorus: n/a (Raekwon)) 
 He's a high roller, he's a shot caller 
 He's a slick talker, he's a big baller 
 (Wise words he spoke to me, look how it's suppose to be)"
176,Raekwon,hiphop,Violations,"Heed the battle call, check the catalog 
 Flow so crazy it's adderall with the padded walls 
 More twisted turns in the body that's on the baddest broad 
 These cattle call 'rappers' is weak, my honor matter more 
 Your whole style stiffer than mannequins you see at a store 
 You mannequins are Chante and Kenny, I mean the Latter more 
 No ping pong and we volleying with the back and forth 
 Straight King Kong and the trap we blasting off, son 
 You want Nigerian money, see me in Qatar drunk 
 Waving the K, I can't fake the funk 
 Blessed with the belts, flying in the stealth 
 Jewelry on the neck, diamonds in the Cheals 
 You know I wrestle with pawns, getting my money, we gone 
 The automatic laying player, we Dons 
 You can't see us, the new phenoms, I like the Benz zeons 
 Split your wig like I got three arms 
 I need a fiancé, at least a Beyoncé 
 I know my vision beyond some other shit 
 I'm just as meaty as moms 
 I'm supposed to be on, the greenery gone 
 I'm still the king of the drama 
 Put the Ruger down your throat, eat my Johnson nigga 
 Way they all in their feelings, what's wrong with niggas 
 Forgetting silence is still a response 
 The way the blood paint the wall you can tell he really an artist 
 I get it like Whitey Bulger till rapture, dearly departed 
 We gon' Lex in, my nigga 
 These are blessings, my nigga 
 Keep stressing, my nigga 
 Don't stress, little nigga

 Eat a clip, little nigga 
 Niggas trip, little nigga 
 Violations we gon' flip, little nigga 
 It's the champion flow, the Jordan, LeBron and Kobe 
 The Obi Wan Kenobi, of getting that guap-a-mole 
 We touring overseas, got her fanning out like a Dakota 
 I'm trying to get the check, I'm Martina Navratilova 
 Catch me at the races, gateway at Saratoga 
 They trying to place my face 'cause we mobbing, we taking over 
 My niggas keep it pure while you cut with the baking soda 
 These rappers be stretching the truth like they taking yoga 
 Couch potatoes, now they made us into a vegetable culture 
 A result of division like it's a decimal quotient 
 Do the math, my nigga, do the math 
 You'd never settle for less than the whole if you knew the half 
 Rough as alligator skin getting crazy grip 
 I'm so amazing with words I make a baby spit 
 Resting in Tibet, wild with the Gillette 
 Giraffe long goose on, my boots is [?] 
 Pocket full of coins, producers on set 
 Niggas with the coupes is on next 
 The losers gon' step, the users gon' check 
 We choosing our ninjas, the Jews is on deck 
 Refuse, that's a debt, pool with the steps 
 Everybody see us, the tools is all TECs 
 Anything come through we school, wan' bet? 
 Fuck you gon' tell us? He knew we on next 
 They wanna act like they know me, you don't know me nigga 
 You got the baby boy hustle, you a Jody nigga 
 You wanna swim with the sharks, I'm Chief Brody killin' 
 Get your jaw tapped this is raw rap, come on, yeah

177,Raekwon,hiphop,Wake Up,"(One) gun go off, showin' everything is lost 
 (Two) hold between me and you, these the rules, c'mon 
 (Three) yo, we gotta stand together to take cream'n 
 (Four) without me and you the crew just could never be 
 Imaginative mental, blood flyin' 
 The most hardest niggas cock they iron 
 Foul, live like a Lion 
 Listen to the streets and your gun go off 
 Sorta like a show off 
 Jungle way of livin', hittin' dro off 
 Lifestyle changes niggas see that 
 They gettin' anxious just to throw one in your ski hat 
 Watch your language, yeah, you fresher than a Million bucks 
 You got a new hustle, you hardly knew niggas would envy lust 
 They gettin' hungrier and niggas bust 
 They lit a bigger dutch 
 Fixin' them Calicos to dig your guts 
 Detectives roam 
 Niggas come home and got a bigger dome 
 Ready to zone on what a nigga own 
 Caught in the mischief 
 How can you live when it's a sickness 
 That sorrounds that projects and the trenches 
 Walkin' through the bushes at night 
 You gotta be sharp like a butcher knife 
 Subtly show up when the jooks is right 
 And everything will have a major like 
 Whether it's black or white 
 Nobody knows until they snatch your life 
 Wake up son, the season's just a thing the mind make up 
 It's only real kid, ha, wake up! 
 The meat market pardon me, the heat market 
 Chill, we got it on lock, the nigga got to sweet talkin' 
 I gotta eat and got the beast targeted 
 Relax, my Brothers on 'role, niggas got police barkin' 
 They want us killed, sieze the sargent 
 Blowin' each cartridge 
 We ill, realer in each market 
 Feel the leather jacket, sleek ostrich 
 Unleash the arsonist, just popped the wig off of each hostage 
 Make it real and make his niece watch it 
 Yokin' Grandmothers up, we kill until his peeps squash it 
 Verse is somethin' mean regardless 
 A green jar of harvest 
 Just smoke, niggas got the green Garcia's 
 A terrifying team of heartless 
 Move on the Narcs's 
 We only on it for extreme profits 
 And anyway we dream darkness 
 I saw it through the Jean Paul Gotier mint green gleam optics 
 So wake up Son, the season's just a thing the mind make up 
 It's only real kid, ha, wake up. 
 A message from Elijah's kids 
 My eyes opened, got wise on the biz 
 Start risin' my wig 
 Seen everything I saw before 
 Had dreams behind a wall 
 All I wanted was to balance my all 
 Make it through feedin' my kind 
 Readin' the lines 
 On how the dollar bill is shaped and designed 
 Taught from the Eighties 
 Talk, build, and protect all Babies 
 Strong shelters with strong Ladies 
 A nigga died, died amongst Daisies 
 He did it for the Babies 
 That's peace, feed 'em if they gettin' lazy."
178,Raekwon,hiphop,We Go Where Ever We Want,"Yeah,

 Watch cost 1.5, I got the blue shit 
 Everybody love me 
 His texture's automatic money 
 Independent drug game dummy 
 Gettin' his, raisin' kids 
 These are big boy scholars 
 Flash money like Floyd 
 Got the big gold wallet 
 Roll out, it's 40 of us frontin' a bus 
 That's the new stretch bubble 
 Pipe the color of crust 
 Gettin' high, chillin' fly, yellin' multi 
 Now I'm in hard bottoms

 Hey, fuck you, man! 
 Who put this thing together? 
 Me! 
 That's who 
 Who do I trust? 
 Me! 
 (Raekwon) 
 Nah this what I'ma do 
 I'ma get on the phone one time 
 Yae yo, yae yo, cop that yae yo 
 Gotta be thuggin', thuggin' 
 Verse 1: Raekwon the Chef 
 Yo, ayyo, why this shit ain't cooking up right? 
 Papi told me this is solid white 
 Fuck it wrap it up take it back up 
 Still in all it's a play out 
 Tired of spending money 
 Might get them niggas laid out 
 Yo, yo Fernando sent me, yo 
 Stop acting hostile, yo 
 And yo don't point that shit at me 
 Bad enough I gotta come in the crib 
 Wid Spanish niggas using languages and shit 
 I'm feeling like a dick 
 Left the crib wit my hand brolic 
 This is some bullshit 
 Might get knocked take the wrist coward 
 Yo, Fernando what happened? 
 Shit cooking up backwards 
 Light up a Backwood 
 Don't make me backtrack 
 Blew it dime it, the yae yo lay low 
 Saying in my mind 
 Fuck that papi gotta pay off 
 Cash rules the Power-Wu chant it 
 Yo Louis this ain't our product 
 This is Carlos family 
 Oh y'all wanna play me like a smoker 
 Coming out my ice choker 
 My man in the back, looking colder 
 Papi yo why y'all wanna jucks me 
 Yo listen B we got the best clientele since '83 
 Fuck it, pull out the pot let's cook it 
 Light the stove up 
 Julie go to the store get some flour 
 Sat back burning a big dutch 
 With the crisp 18 shot glock, stashed in my nuts 
 Poured it in the Pyrex sizzling 
 Now it start drizzling 
 Rainy day murder, black won't miss him 
 Still I'm yelling this shit is business 
 But they still ain't gon' violate 
 What I stand for wid these drizzers 
 He took it off the stove run the water 
 Trying to work me, yo 
 Knew I shouldn'ta hit the nigga's daughter 
 He mighta showed more love 
 Than went in the freezer 
 And broke the ice down, pour it in 
 We both looking at it on the twirl around particles grew 
 Fly Khaluas is mad sliding Coronas through 
 Feeling like Castro's cousin 
 Gave them niggas all of my life 
 All of my paper all my judgement 
 It droppa only like an ounce worth 
 Should I just come out my shirt 
 Go berserk and let the Macks burst 
 Skate off body in the Bronx 
 Same shit Gotti was on 
 Shallah, they gonna get your's play it calm 
 Seventeen five was the total plus the five, 
 Hundred for the cab driver that was rolling 
 Yo, he blank rubbed his nose like a Nazi 
 Jocked me, glock meets cock 
 Ready to light up shop, watch me 
 Standin by the 'fridgerator then caught the gleam 
 From his eye, and he watch a nigga ride for the rent 
 He looked up, recognized real 
 Oh Papi, yo, pardon me 
 Your glass spilled all over the floor 
 Guess that's real, we both shakin hands 
 Holdin' guns, gave me back, all my ones 
 We did that shit political, it's all done 
 Last word, we bout to vanish 
 Cognio, you woulda bust, right? 
 Don't Puerto Ricans speak Spanish? 
 Yaaaae yooooo 
 Cop that yae yo

 Bap do dap do da da yae yo 
 Cop that yae yo

 Say hello to my little friend! 
 Verse 2: Cormega 
 Yo, lay back like a fat Buddha 
 Holdin' my pearl handle mover in a Land Cruiser 
 Rims shine like day time, in Bermuda 
 I write rhymes smoother than niggas 
 Who be frontin like, half a key movers 
 I have to be financially set 
 New Lex in front of my duplex 
 My shine, drippin wet 
 New nines in case your crew flex 
 My brown eyes leavin' your boo stressed 
 So bad you had to get a new red vest 
 'Cause I collects tax 
 My advice is to accept that 
 Step back, blast, don't even wet that 
 Yo, it's mandatory 
 I'm self explanatory 
 Don't front on me shorty 
 Young Scarface, for real 
 I wanna die blastin 
 Fuck stashin 
 My next 50 G's I'm buyin me a fire wagon 
 Thugged out, leather interior 
 Meg is superior 
 My art of war dented your area 
 My mug shot praised in jail cells and drug spots 
 My razor, touch faces and carve rocks 
 Corrupt cop cases 
 Had me on semi-vacations 
 It's day dreams, lay down way schemes 
 For niggas who get paid and takes cream 
 Drugs supplier, thugs admire 
 Ghetto dun-dun gunfire 
 Keep my nine higher 
 The drama equilizor 
 I speak the mind-a, Keyser 
 Soze, no survivors

 I, can't, leave these streets alone, no more (Yeah, yo) 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Aiyo, I'm skinned up, Nikes is scuffed, still bugging 
 Earlier, around four, how I escaped the bus 
 The way I fell, cracked the face of my watch, my man's chanting me on 
 Like run, son, don't go up in the spot 
 Jetting through bushes and backyards, neighbors is ratting me out 
 Dogs is barking all you hear is the cars 
 Sirens, I'm trying to think, and toss the iron 
 Bomb in my sweats, got me running funny, you think I'm lying 
 May God strike me, if he don't like me, I'm tired and I'm out of breath 
 The weed got me paranoid, my heart's pounding through my chest 
 Trying to focus, yup, and make progress 
 That's what I get for slinging in them projects 
 Next thing you knew, I'm in this bitch's crib, chilling 
 Told 'em my story, you'll like this, I had her legs in the ceiling 
 Cooking me fried fish sticks, hot side of them biscuits 
 While she doing this, the bitch still sliding on lipstick 
 Now I got the fat stomach on, she cracking the Dutch 
 Playing with her pussy on the couch, I'm ready to fuck 
 Like come here, miss Lady Wop, where you put the condom box 
 You finished off the last one, oh shit, I hear the cops 
 Handcuffs and talkies, I mashed the white yorkie 
 Jetting up the steps, and pig want revenge like Porky's 
 So I slid, hid behind the wall, opened the door 
 Like 'ooh', I seen my man Meth going in raw 
 So he jumped up, balls out, hid in the closet 
 I'm dying laughing, he said ""Yo, Starks, be quiet"" 
 (Method Man) 
 And let me put my drawers on, nigga, what dope you on, shit? 
 Should of knocked, before you came in the spot, Ghost, you wrong 
 Busting in here on that government shit, got the chick screaming 
 Grabbing the sheets, trying to cover her tits 
 She's asthmatic and you laughing, son, I bumped my toe all the nice things 
 Just run and try to grab the gun 
 'Cause shit's real, man, you spazzing dunn 
 There come a time in a man's life, he got to toss his pack and run 
 You know he family like Crack and Pun, but Mr. G.F.K. 
 State your business, after that, be one 
 Now can it be that you hot, lord, you did some shit on the block 
 That the cops trying to lock you for 
 Can't believe you blowing the spot, lord, my chick is bugging 
 You tripping, my dick keep slipping out my boxer drawers 
 Now I'm caught up in the drug sting, niggas is calling my horn 
 Police is hitting every corner we on 
 Can't understand that it's a thug thing, and in the middle of thought 
 I'm interrupted by Shallah Raekwon 
 (Raekwon) 
 I need my money, Meth, going on about them hundred birds 
 Tell Tone to get at me, on 'em and my clients want work 
 He know we fresh out, tell the kid meet me, matter fact, beep me 
 Word to mother, lord, sunny got me hurt 
 You still fucking shorty? I knew it, the big mouth broad 
 That be yoking my balls out, her little brother wanted two bricks 
 You know that nigga 'Lipps, he Maybach, on 26 
 All he do is get money, hustle, he's a dick 
 Tell me foul shit, wild shit, y'all niggas wear a lot a loud shit 
 Yo, that Steve Rifkin style, shit 
 Hit me with some other talk, him in New York 
 They love the Venezuela nigga, stabbed his son with a fork 
 That was Jesus roofs, his little niece 
 Little niece, his father's homework 
 That's the kid who gave us a boost 
 He gave them things on the arms, said for us to be calm 
 And if some beef pop off, go 'head and ring the alarm"

 And been down for years stayed on point like stairs (yeah, word up) 
 Cause the jealous motherfuckers want to end my career 
 I never feared, the ghetto is hell, but I learned ta 
 Keep my mouth shut and pack a nickel-plated burner 
 And squeeze, if I get front on my nine millimi 
 Will have my enemies, behind trees

 I meditate then swing with the force of mountains 
 Brain cells is able to be bi-debatable 
 When I think it's hazardous to your ozone layer 
 A premeditated killer plan so kill the Mayor, my silencer 
 Causes niggaz to hush, then I rush, like Manchus 
 Who guard jewels and collect, Cash Rules with heavy jewels 
 I live by name and cut veins 
 Burning bodies into flames 
 Between my anger, I lock down every chamber 
 Hillside strangler, a nigga with a mask like Lone Ranger 
 Rap poetic is injected into the brain athletic 
 Build off of rhymin' calisthenics 
 I'm determined, I raise a army like Hitler done Germans 
 And become the Allied commander, my enemies is catching on camera 
 They seek death, I begin to torture them (calm down kid take your time) 
 By giving butterfly stitches, bear witness 
 As I hang with Jehovah's Witnesses 
 Older cats max with young godz that got the guns 
 Out of town Big Willie niggaz best to run 
 Or get stung, by the killa bee stinga from the slums 
 From the young Shaolin Monks, taking heads with the tongue 
 Yo, yo, this is manslaughter, so what you want to do 
 Last year, you ran for the border with your crew 
 I flip, stacks, all the, time when I rhyme 
 Libra is my sign, and can't stand swine 
 When I dine, the automatic weapon 
 Got niggaz steppin', in the opposite direction 
 My jurisdiction, is off grounds to you clowns 
 My proposition, meaning you go round for round 
 Straight up and down, I broke the sound barrier 
 Scarier, than a tight skirt wrapped around a transvestite 
 The grammar, hype, nigga check your stacks 
 Or you'll be rhyming with a broke back 
 Niggaz talk about they rollin' deep up in here 
 The only way you roll is if you in a wheelchair 
 Older 
 Yo, y'all calm down man calm down calm down 
 Yeah, and yo 
 Now yo, youknowhatI'msayin? 
 I want to tell y'all 
 Y'all up under the restrictions of the Wu camp 
 Aiyyo Rae, you got Killa Sin 
 YouknowhatI'msayin? 
 Madman, Shyheim the Rugged Child 
 So just take your time and handle life as it comes 
 Motherfuckin' Rubbabandz, the young godz comin' through 
 Cause the real nigga gonna know what they gotta do 
 Showin' and provin' youknowhatI'msayin? Shaolin forever 
 Yo, may all the bullshit cease, increase the war fuck the peace 
 Make shit hot like rockin' tube socks at Jones Beach 
 N the summer, number one gunner run for cover 
 Keep 'em steppin' with more Lethal Weapons than Danny Gloves 
 I cock back, action packed raps and gats 
 Niggaz trade mats for prats people react, to RZA sharp tracks 
 Another day nother body dropped you better keep your shottie cocked 
 For actin' snotty Hobbes catch karate chops 
 Cause Wu-Tang live, forever and a day 
 You better pray for better ways to get away when my Beretta spray 
 We never play with commercialism 
 The hardcore rhythm give 'em more hell than an exorcism 
 My terrordome be a clever poem let it be known 
 I'm packin' chrome and rollin' phatter than eleven bones 
 My crew's sicker than that AIDS shit 
 While others get played quick, 'cause we be making hits through the grave sift 
 My right hand man, myself and the Clan 
 Gun and mic stands reverses help me see my first a hundred grand 
 And to my Physical one love power crazy real 
 For all them carbon copy niggaz lurkin' in the rap deal

183,Raekwon,hiphop,Youngstown Heist,"For the city, to get this money, Vegas, yo, yeah 
 Here's the rundown, Mustafa's getting money out in Youngstown 
 Get some goons together, a driver and bring them guns down 
 Heard he had his hands in some bricks, plus a few pounds 
 Hang with some wild Haitians, settle shop in the dude lounge 
 Niggas is migrating, he came from Cue Gardens 
 With a live situation, got it in preparation 
 When you get there, pick up the whip with the navigation 
 And follow all the clowns till you get to your destination 
 (We here Tone, got our masks on, we bout to run up in 
 I know you ain't talking 'bout the house, with the broken henge 
 65 Alpine Drive, it's looking shady 
 So I hopped out, pulled the glock out, plus the 3-18 
 Hit the living room, I've seen a ripped up sofa, a shattered coffee table 
 Broken lamps, and a flipped up stroller 
 The place was ransacked from front to back) 
 Yo, Trife, what you talking, black? 
 (Yo, Starks, cut the bullshit and tell me, where the office at) 
 Take a left and head, down the hallway steps 
 Pass the painting on the wall, the third door on the left 
 The safe is on the wall above the fireplace near the decks 
 Look inside the top drawer, and get the key out the chest 
 Damn son, aiyo what's taking this nigga Trife so long (I don't know) 
 Oh shit, yo Bull, get down, get down, get down 
 Look at Stark pulling up, son (aw man) 
 I'm a try to kill this nigga 
 Aiyo, hurry up I see a car pulling up, windows tinted 
 Can't really tell who's in it, but, I know it's a rented 
 Down south plates, Atlanta or, one of them states (yo the cameras on) 
 Man, I wanna see what's up in those crates 
 Should I pop off, take his top off, before he get to you 
 Bully like (Yo, chill, chill, this is what we gon' do) aight 
 (Go ask for directions, right, I'm a go around the back 
 Wait for them to come inside, I'll hit these niggas with the mack) 
 OK, before it even get to that, let me see where Trife is at 
 Hopefully he on his way, and no one gotta die today (bang bang) 
 Two shots go off (Homey trapped inside, quick put the mask on, Sheek) 
 Fuck it, Bully, let's ride 
 Shooting out the sunroof, missing and shit 
 I was too high, still think my Dutchie was lit 
 Trife running out the building, busting, cussing 
 Blood everywhere, you had to see this shit (disgusting)"
