 But little did I know that in the very next apartment 
 There'd be trouble on the brew for me 
 Ubiquitous, I wish I could be 
 Because the clock cuts short my own day 
 One hundred things to do before I rest my sore ass 
 Upon the cushion that supports my array

 So get by the green way, yes 
 I knocked upon their door 
 In hopes of bidding them their welcome 
 And instead I was caught by an eye 
 His pupil was wide open 
 Kinda like a liquor barn at 3:00 
 It was indoubadoubly dose derived 
 It was then that they took me 
 And shined their lights between my eyes 
 He said, ""What do you know? 
 Why are you here? What's the catch? 
 Why not explain in clear? Why you're thinking aloud?"" 
 I wish I could've just kept to my own 
 My hospitality has been too well spent and I've paid my rent 
 I should've kept my thoughts on who might've been inside 
 So that my mind could sit and delude my pride 
 Can this be? Trouble! 
 So if I may, slip you a tip 
 You'd best stay away from 421 
 Trouble 
 So get high the green way 
 So get by the green way, go

 Until I find a way to hide myself from those in 421 
 One, one away from the good one

121,Incubus,rock,Undefeated,"Could there be another universe? 
 One that wasn't always out to getcha? 
 And it breaks my heart a little bit 
 That here I'm like a sleepwalker 
 Half alive and hanging by a thread 
 I'm not dead yet 
 I'm not dead yet, no 
 I'm bent but not broken 
 And I'm not dead yet, no 
 Yeah 
 Maybe there's a poem in reverse 
 Spoken and it holds me out forever 
 And it breaks my heart a little bit 
 That love is like a blind archer 
 Tryin' to shoot an apple off my head 
 I'm not dead yet 
 I'm not dead yet, no 
 I'm bent but not broken 
 And I'm not dead yet 
 Not yet 
 We're undefeated, bent but not broken 
 No they ain't seen nothing yet

122,Incubus,rock,Loneliest,"I have forgotten what it feels like 
 I don't remember it's true 
 It will take all I have left to make this right 
 But I'd like to try it with you 
 I'm the loneliest I've ever been tonight 
 I'm the loneliest I've ever been, that's right 
 I'm the loneliest I've ever been tonight 
 I'm the loneliest I've ever been tonight 
 I have forgotten what it tastes like 
 I don't remember, do you? 
 Oh, it'll take all I have left to work this out 
 Oh, push on 'til I'm breaking through 
 Oh, I'm the loneliest I've ever been tonight 
 I'm the loneliest I've ever been tonight 
 I'm inspired by your proposition, but I don't trust my intuition 
 I'm the loneliest I've ever been tonight 
 Yours is the curtain that I'd like to pull back 
 But I can't be certain that you're really real

123,Incubus,rock,When I Became A Man,"Yes 
 I was but a boy and everything was money 
 I found a girl so juicy and sweet 
 I was just a sweet little boy 
 She showed me how to shower

 Oh a shower 
 Oh that shower and I 
 That was the day I became a man"
124,Incubus,rock,Familiar Faces,"Where'd my heroes go 
 Did they change or did I 
 Man it gets me, gets me every time 
 The punch is spiked and I want to keep the lights on 
 This place is so familiar 
 Your face is so familiar 
 This place is so 
 Your face is so 
 So familiar 
 I miss them golden days 
 When I could trust not fight 
 Now it hits me right between the eyes 
 Familiar faces rally around a light 
 This place is so familiar 
 Your face is so familiar 
 This place is so 
 Your face is so 
 So familiar 
 Here we go wild 
 It's time for you to come out of hibernation 
 Here we go wild 
 It's time for you to come out of hibernation 
 The world has gone wild 
 It's time for us to come out of hibernation 
 The world has gone wild 
 It's time for us to come out of hibernation

125,Incubus,rock,Love In A Time Of Surveillance,"Way, way out in space there's an island 
 The natives are restless and violent 
 Not long ago they were silent 
 Now they buzz and hum 
 Oh how far they've come right 
 Disappear, big data's got your number 
 Big data's got you 
 Disappear, big data's got your number 
 Big data's got your 
 But please do explain to me brother 
 Why all the spying on each other? 
 To sell to me this, then the other 
 I need a nom de guerre 
 It's all so unfair 
 Disappear, big data's got your number 
 Big data's got you 
 Disappear, big data's got your number 
 Big data got you 
 I will embrace my assailants 
 Kill them with kindness and patience 
 Love in a time of surveillance 
 Is in such a fuss at Voyeurs-R-Us 
 You're a seed to fill 
 It's all grist for the mill, just 
 Disappear, big data's got your number 
 Big data got you 
 Disappear, big data's got your number 
 Big data's got you

126,Incubus,rock,Throw Out The Map,"(Coughs, sounds of walking on gravel) 
 Do you have any idea where we are right now? 
 I have no fucking idea where we are 
 I wanna lose my mind 
 I wanna shed my skin 
 Dive in the deep end, head first, a brick in a river 
 Under the pale, blue lines 
 Look at the big sky spin 
 I'm holding out till I see heaven and hell 
 Where? Where do we go from here? 
 Where? Where? Where do we go from here? 
 Throw out the map! 
 Don't look back! 
 Throw out the map! 
 Yeah! 
 Yeah 
 Am I alone down here? 
 Under the pale, blue lines 
 Was that another or was that just an echo? 
 I want a new design 
 I need to shed my skin 
 Where do we go from here man? 
 Where do we go from here? 
 Where? Where? Where do we go from here? 
 Throw out the map! 
 Don't look back! 
 Throw out the map! 
 Yeah! 
 Yeah, oh 
 I want to lose my mind 
 Throw out the map! 
 Don't look back! 
 Throw out the map!

127,Incubus,rock,Anti-Gravity Love Song,"I'm home alone tonight 
 Full moon illuminates my room and sends my mind aflight 
 I think I was dreaming up some thoughts that were seemingly 
 Possible with you 
 And so I call you on the tin can phone 
 We rendezvous at a quarter-two and make sure we're alone 
 I think I've found a way for you and I to finally fly free 
 When we get there, we're gonna fly so far away 
 Making sure to laugh, while we experience anti-gravity 
 Anti-gravity, anti-gravity 
 For years, I kept it to myself 
 Now potentialities are bound are living under my shelf 
 Simply choose your destination from the diamond canopy 
 And we'll be there 
 And so I call you on the tin can phone 
 We rendezvous at a quarter-two and make sure we're alone 
 I think I've found the way for you and I to finally be free 
 When we get there, we're gonna fly so far away 
 Making sure to laugh, while we experience anti-gravity 
 Anti-gravity, anti-gravity 
 Anti-gravity, anti-gravity, oh yeah"

129,Incubus,rock,Stellar - Acoustic,"Meet me in outer space 
 We could spend the night 
 Watch the earth come up 
 I've grown tired of that place 
 Won't you come with me? 
 We could start again 
 How do you do it? 
 Make me feel like I do 
 How do you do it? 
 It's better than I ever knew, knew 
 Meet me in outer space 
 I will hold you close, if you're afraid of heights 
 I need you to see this place 
 It might be the only way 
 That I can show you how 
 It feels to be inside of you 
 How do you do it? 
 Make me feel like I do 
 How do you do it? 
 It's better than I ever knew, knew 
 How do you do it? 
 Make me feel like I do, knew 
 Ooh, you are stellar, you are stellar 
 How do you do it? 
 To make me feel like I do 
 How do you do it?

 How do you do it? 
 To make me feel like I do 
 How do you do it? 
 To make me feel like I do"
