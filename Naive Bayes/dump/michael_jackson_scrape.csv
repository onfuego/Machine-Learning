0,Michael Jackson,pop,Ain't No Sunshine,"Spoken Intro: 
 You ever want something 
 That you know you shouldn't have 
 The more you know you shouldn't have it, 
 The more you want it 
 And then one day you get it, 
 It's so good too 
 But it's just like my girl 
 When she's around me 
 I just feel so good, so good 
 But right now I just feel cold, so cold 
 Right down to my bones 
 'Cause ooh... 
 Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
 It's not warm when she's away 
 Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
 And she's always gone too long 
 Anytime she goes away 
 Wonder this time where she's gone 
 Wonder if she's gone to stay 
 Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
 And this house just ain't no home 
 Anytime she goes away 
 I know, I know, I know, I know, 
 I know, know, know, know, know, 
 I know, I know, 
 Hey I ought to leave 
 I ought to leave her alone 
 Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
 Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
 Only darkness every day 
 Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
 And this house just ain't no home 
 Anytime she goes away"

 To erase the past 
 Baby don't leave me

3,Michael Jackson,pop,In Our Small Way,"Maybe you and I can't do great things 
 We may not change the world in one day 
 But we still can change some things today... 
 In our small way 
 Empty words are not enough 
 Where there's hurt we'll be a crush 
 When there's thirst we'll fill each other's cup 
 Because we care we love enough to share 
 Maybe you and I can't do great things 
 We may not change the world in one day 
 But we still can change some things today... 
 In our small way 
 In despair we'll be the hope 
 And the prayer that frees the soul 
 We'll be there to share each lonely road 
 Because we love, I know 
 We care enough 
 Maybe you and I can't do great things 
 We may not change the world in one day 
 But we still can change some things today... 
 In our small way 
 Just a little time is all it takes 
 What a difference just a smile can make, you'll see 
 Love is all we need 
 Maybe you and I can't do great things 
 We may not change the world in one day 
 But we still can change some things today... 
 In our small way"
4,Michael Jackson,pop,Got To Be There,"Got to be there, got to be there 
 In the morning 
 When she says hello to the world 
 Got to be there, got to be there 
 Bring her good times 
 And show her that she's my girl 
 Oh what a feeling there'll be 
 The moment I know she loves me 
 'Cause when I look in her eyes I realize 
 I need her sharing her world beside me 
 So I've got to be there 
 Got to be there in the morning 
 And welcome her into my world 
 And show her that she is my girl 
 When she says, ""Hello world!"" 
 I need her sharing the world beside me 
 That's why I've got to be there 
 Got to be there where love begins 
 And that's everywhere she goes 
 I've got to be there so she knows 
 That when she's with me, she's home 
 Got to be there 
 Got to be there"

 The wise old owl, the big black crow 
 Flappin' their wings singing go bird go 
 Rockin' robin, rock rock 
 Rockin' robin' 
 Blow rockin' robin 
 'Cause we're really gonna rock tonight 
 Pretty little raven at the bird-band stand 
 Told them how to do the bop and it was grand

 He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriol 
 He rocks in the tree tops all day long 
 Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singing his song 
 All the little birdies on Jaybird Street

 Rockin' robin' 
 Blow rockin' robin

 And oh my darling, now you're gone 
 Love is here 
 And oh my darling, now you're gone 
 You persuaded me to love you 
 And I did 
 But instead of tendeness 
 I found heartache instead 
 Into your arms I fell 
 So unaware of the loneliness 
 Thar was waiting there 
 spoken: 
 You closed the door to your heart, girl 
 And you turned the key 
 Locked your love away from me 
 Love is here 
 And oh my darling, now you're gone 
 You made me love you 
 And oh my darling, now you're gone 
 You said loving you 
 Would make life beautiful 
 With each passing day 
 But as soon as love came 
 Into my heart 
 You turned and you walked 
 Just walked away 
 spoken: 
 You stripped me of my dreams 
 You gave me faith, then you took my hope 
 Look at me now 
 Look at me 
 See what loving has done to me 
 Look at my face 
 See how cryin' has left its trace 
 After you made me all your own 
 Then you left me all alone 
 You made your words sound so sweet 
 Knowing that your love I couldn't keep 
 spoken: 
 My heart cries out for your tuch 
 But baby, you're not there 
 And the lonely cry fades in the air 
 Love is here 
 And oh my darling, now you're gone 
 Love is here 
 And oh my darling, now you're gone 
 You made me love you 
 Oh oh my darling, now you're gone

 Ooh ooh my darling, now you're gone"

 Let Sadness see what Happy does 
 Let Happy be where Sadness was till now"

 That's the new word for today 
 E-U-P-H-O-R-I-A 
 It's very easy to say 
 Say Euphoria and you'll feel fine from the start 
 You can close your eyes 
 And see the world with your heart 
 Do what you wish, be what you are 
 What a victorious thrill 
 Wearing a smile, all of the while 
 Feeling the world standing still 
 Watch raindbows glow rest on a bed of flowers 
 Then dial a star 
 Anything's in your powers 
 Euphoria 
 Full euphoria 
 Knowing no ills, needing no pills 
 Singing a rock and roll hymn 
 Feeling glorious, full of love 
 Fine from the start 
 You can close your eyes 
 And see the world with your heart 
 How good to be happy and free 
 Living the way that you choose 
 Healthly and clean 
 Can't understand anyone having the blues 
 Euphoria never to feel frustration 
 How great to give love without invitation 
 Euphoria, euphoria 
 Long as we love each other"

 She's out of my life 
 And I don't know whether to laugh or cry 
 I don't know whether to live or die 
 And it cuts like a knife 
 She's out of my life 
 It's out of my hands 
 It's out of my hands 
 To think for two years she was here 
 And I took her for granted I was so cavalier 
 Now the way that it stands 
 She's out of my hands 
 So I've learned that love's not possession 
 And I've learned that love won't wait 
 Now I've learned that love needs expression 
 But I learned too late 
 ...She's out of my life 
 She's out of my life 
 Damned indecision and cursed pride 
 Kept my love for her locked deep inside 
 And it cuts like a knife 
 She's out of my life"

 I can't help it if I wanted to 
 I wouldn't help it even if I could

 I wouldn't help it even if I could 
 I can't help it if I wanted to 
 I wouldn't help it, no 
 Love to run my fingers 
 Softly while you sigh 
 Love came and possessed you 
 Bringing sparkles to your eyes 
 Like a trip to heaven 
 Heaven is the prize 
 And I'm so glad I found you girl 
 You're an angel in disguise 
 I can't help it if I wanted to 
 I wouldn't help it even if I could 
 I can't help it if I wanted to

 That's making me high 
 It's the being in love that make me cry, cry, cry 
 You're not like anybody I ever knew 
 But that don't mean that I don't know where we are 
 And though I find myself attracted to you 
 This time I'm trying not to go too far, cause... 
 No matter how it starts it ends the same 
 Someone's always doing someone more 
 Trading in the passion for that taste of pain 
 It's only gonna happen again 
 It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high 
 It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry 
 It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high

 All night... all night 
 Patti Austin 
 And though I'm trying not to look in your eyes 
 Each time I do they kind of burn right through me 
 Don't want to lay down in a bed full of lies 
 And yet my heart is saying come and do me 
 Now we're just a web of mystery 
 A possibility of more to come 
 I'd rather leave the fantasy of what might be 
 But here I go falling again 
 It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high 
 It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry 
 It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high 
 It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry 
 It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high

 She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene 
 Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one 
 Who will dance on the floor in the round 
 People always told me be careful of what you do 
 And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts 
 And Mother always told me be careful of who you love

 She's just a girl who claims that I am the one 
 But the kid is not my son 
 She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son 
 For forty days and forty nights 
 The law was on her side 
 But who can stand when she's in demand 
 Her schemes and plans 
 'Cause we danced on the floor in the round 
 So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice 
 (Do think twice, do think twice) 
 She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me 
 Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no!) 
 'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby 
 People always told me be careful of what you do 
 And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts

 The city's heart begins to beat 
 Reaching out, I touch her shoulder 
 I'm dreaming of the street

58,Michael Jackson,pop,Someone In The Dark,"All alone wishing on stars 
 Waiting for you to find me 
 One sweet night I knew I would see 
 A stranger who'd be my friend 
 When someone in the dark reaches out to you 
 And touches off a spark that comes shining through 
 It tells you never be afraid 
 Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow 
 A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow 
 Like it was written in the stars I knew 
 My friend, my someone in the dark was you 
 Promise me we'll always be 
 Walking the world together 
 Hand in hand where dreams never end 
 My star secret friend and me 
 When someone in the dark reaches out to you 
 And touches off a spark that comes shining through 
 It tells you never be afraid 
 Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow 
 A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow 
 Look for the rainbow in the sky 
 I believe you and I 
 Could never really say goodbye 
 Wherever you may be 
 I'll look up and see 
 Someone in the dark for me 
 Wherever you may be 
 I'll look up and see 
 Someone in the dark for me"
59,Michael Jackson,pop,Carousel,"She's from a world 
 Of popcorn and candy 
 Pony rides for a dime 
 Little children laughing 
 I'm from a world 
 Of disappointments and confusions 
 But I want her to be mine 
 I started talking 
 She kept on walking 
 She disappeared into the crowd 
 I lost my heart 
 On the carousel 
 To a circus girl 
 Who left my heart in pieces 
 Lost my heart 
 On The carousel 
 To a circus girl 
 Who ran away 
 I was the clown 
 And she was the dancer 
 We both knew it wouldn't work 
 But we took our chances 
 What I can't recall 
 Is if there was a girl at all 
 Or was it my imagination? 
 I still remember 
 All of those faces 
 And now all I have is memories 
 I lost my heart 
 On the carousel 
 To a circus girl 
 Who left my heart in pieces 
 Lost my heart 
 On The carousel 
 To a circus girl 
 Who ran away 
 Two different people 
 In love for an instant 
 To see that the circus came today 
 Sometimes I can hear the calliope 
 And I can hear her calling me 
 Don't you know? 
 I lost my heart 
 On the carousel 
 To a circus girl 
 Who left my heart in pieces 
 Lost my heart 
 On The carousel 
 To a circus girl 
 Who ran away"

 Favorite winter coat 
 This wind is blowing my mind 
 I see the kids in the street 
 With not enough to eat 
 Who am I, to be blind? 
 Pretending not to see their needs 
 A summer's disregard 
 A broken bottle top 
 And a one man's soul 
 They follow each other on the wind, ya' know

 That's why I want you to know

 I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love 
 It's time that I realize 
 There are some with no home 
 Not a nickel to loan 
 Could it be really me 
 Pretending that they're not alone 
 A widow deeply scarred 
 Somebody's broken heart 
 And a washed - out dream 
 (Washed - out dream) 
 They follow the pattern of the wind, ya' see 
 'Cause they got no place to be 
 That's why I'm starting with me

 Know me at all 
 I just want to touch you 
 And hold you 
 I need you 
 God I need you 
 I love you so much 
 Each time the wind blows 
 I hear your voice so 
 I call your name 
 Whispers at morning 
 Our love is dawning 
 Heaven's glad you came

 And angels sing

 I can't live my life without you 
 I just can't hold on 
 I feel we belong 
 My life ain't worth living

 I just can't stop loving you 
 And if I stop then tell me just what will I do 
 'Cause I just can't stop loving you

 I pray in you I'll find 
 A love so true 
 When morning awakes me 
 Will you come and take me 
 I'll wait for you

 I won't stop until 
 I hear your voice saying, ""I do""

 This is my life and I want to see you for always

 I just can't stop loving you

 But I hate sleeping alone 
 Why don't you come with me 
 I said my baby's at home 
 She's probably worried tonight 
 I didn't call on the phone 
 To say that I'm alright 
 Diana walked up to me 
 She said I'm all yours tonight 
 At that I ran to the phone 
 Saying ""baby, I'm alright"" 
 I said but unlock the door 
 Because I forgot the key 
 She said he's not coming back 
 Because he's sleeping with me

 You see, I never met a girl 
 Just like you 
 Come so easy 
 Don't you break my heart 
 'Cause I love you 
 You see, I never met a girl 
 Just like you 
 Come so easy 
 Don't you break my heart 
 'Cause I love you 
 You see, I never met a girl

81,Michael Jackson,pop,Todo Mi Amor Eres Tu,"(Spanish version of ""i just can't stop loving you"") 
 Como la brisa 
 Tu voz me acaricia 
 Y pregunto por ti 
 Cuando amanece 
 Tu amor aparece 
 Y me hace feliz 
 Me conoces bien 
 Y sabes también 
 Que nadie te querrá como yo 
 Tú me haces sentir 
 Deseos de vivir, 
 Junto a ti por siempre 
 Tu amor es mi suerte 
 Tu voz me llama 
 Tu eres quien gana 
 En mi corazón 
 Porque me has dado 
 Algo sagrado 
 Con tu pasión 
 Me conoces bien 
 Y sabes también 
 Que no puedo vivir sin tu amor 
 Y cuando no estás 
 No hay felicidad 
 Mi vida no es vida 
 Si tú te vas 
 Todo mi amor eres tú 
 Todo mi amor eres tú 
 Cuando no estás 
 No hay quien me de lo 
 Que das tú 
 Pues todo mi amor eres tú 
 Noche de estrellas 
 Haz que me quiera 
 Como a ella yo 
 De madrugada 
 Ven que te espera 
 Todo mi amor 
 Soy jóven, lo sé 
 Pero siento que 
 Te quiero y solo vivo por ti 
 Me conoces bien 
 Y sabes también 
 Que yo no puedo 
 Vivir sin tu amor 
 Todo mi amor eres tú 
 Ooh 
 Todo mi amor eres tú 
 Cuando no estás 
 No hay quien me de 
 Lo que das tú 
 Pues todo mi amor eres tú 
 Cambiaremos al mundo mañana 
 Cantaremos sobre lo que fue 
 Y diremos adiós a la tristeza 
 Es mi vida y 
 Quiero estar junto a ti 
 Todo mi amor eres tú 
 (Now baby, oh) 
 Todo mi amor eres tú 
 (If I can't stop!) 
 Cuando no estás 
 No hay quien me de lo que das tú 
 Todo mi amor eres tú 
 Todo mi amor eres tú ..."

83,Michael Jackson,pop,Jam,"Nation to nation, all the world must come together 
 Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out 
 I asked my neighbour for a favor, she said later 
 What has come of all the people, have we lost love, of what it's about 
 I have to find my peace 'cause no one seems to let me be 
 False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities 
 I told my brother there'll be problem time and tears for fears 
 We must live each day like it's the last (go with it, go with it)

 Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out 
 I told my brothers don't you ask me for no favors 
 I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me or scream and shout 
 She prays to God to Buddha then she sings a Talmud song 
 Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong 
 I just want you to recognize me in the temple

 Makin' funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson 
 Smooth criminal that the man is Mike, so relaxed 
 Jingle mingle, jingle in the jungle

 Execute the plan, first I cooled like a fan

 So there's really no time 
 To be trippin' on me 
 You got school teachers 
 Who don't wanna teach 
 You got grown people 
 Who can't write or read 
 You got strange diseases 
 Ah but there's no cure 
 You got many doctors 
 That aren't so sure 
 So tell me 
 Why you wanna trip on me 
 Why you wanna trip on me 
 Stop trippin' 
 We've got more problems 
 Than we'll ever need 
 You got gang violence 
 And bloodshed on the street 
 You got homeless people 
 With no food to eat 
 With no clothes on their back 
 And no shoes for their feet 
 We've got drug addiction 
 In the minds of the weak 
 We've got so much corruption 
 Police brutality 
 We've got streetwalkers 
 Walkin' into darkness 
 Tell me 
 What are you doing 
 To try to stop this 
 Why you wanna trip on me 
 Why you wanna trip on me

 Stop trippin'

89,Michael Jackson,pop,Heal The World,"Think about the generations and say we wanna make it a better place 
 For our children and our children's children 
 So that they know what's a better world for them 
 And think they can make it a better place 
 There's a place in your heart and I know that it is love 
 And this place could be much brighter than tomorrow 
 And if you really try, you'll find there's no need to cry 
 In this place you'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow 
 There are ways to get there if you care enough for the living 
 Make a little space, make a better place 
 Heal the world, make it a better place 
 For you and for me and the entire human race 
 There are people dying if you care enough for the living 
 Make a better place for you and for me 
 If you want to know why, there's a love that cannot lie 
 Love is strong, it only cares for joyful giving 
 If we try, we shall see, in this bliss we cannot feel 
 Fear or dread, we stop existing and start living 
 Then it feels that always love's enough for us growing 
 Make a better world, make a better world 
 Heal the world, make it a better place 
 For you and for me and the entire human race 
 There are people dying if you care enough for the living 
 Make a better place for you and for me 
 And the dream we were conceived in will reveal a joyful face 
 And the world we once believed in will shine again in grace 
 Then why do we keep strangling life, wound this Earth, crucify its soul 
 Though it's plain to see, this world is heavenly, be God's glow 
 We could fly so high, let our spirits never die 
 In my heart, I feel you are all my brothers 
 Create a world with no fear, together we'll cry happy tears 
 See the nations turn their swords into plowshares 
 We could really get there if you cared enough for the living 
 Make a little space to make a better place 
 Heal the world, make it a better place 
 For you and for me and the entire human race 
 There are people dying if you care enough for the living 
 Make a better place for you and for me 
 Heal the world, make it a better place 
 For you and for me and the entire human race 
 There are people dying if you care enough for the living 
 Make a better place for you and for me

 Protection

 Causing grief in human relations

 Just places 
 Faces 
 Where your blood comes from 
 Is where your space is 
 I've seen the bright get duller 
 I'm not going to spend my life being a color

91,Michael Jackson,pop,Who Is It,"I gave her money, I gave her time 
 I gave her everything inside one heart could find 
 I gave her passion, my very soul 
 I gave her promises and secrets so untold 
 And she promised me forever and a day we'd live as one 
 We made a vow we'd live a life anew 
 And she promised me in secret that she'd love me for all time 
 It's a promise so untrue 
 Tell me, what will I do? 
 And it doesn't seem to matter, and it doesn't seem right 
 'Cause the will has brought no fortune 
 Still I cry alone at night 
 Don't you judge of my composure, 'cause I'm lying to myself 
 And the reason why she left me 
 Did she find in someone else? 
 (Who is it?) It is a friend of mine 
 (Who is it?) Is it my brother? 
 (Who is it?) Somebody hurt my soul, now 
 (Who is it?) I can't take this stuff no more 
 I am the damned, I am the dead 
 I am the agony inside the dying head 
 This is injustice, woe unto thee 
 I pray this punishment would have mercy on me 
 And she promised me forever that we'd live our life as one 
 We made our vow to live love so true 
 It seems that she has left me for such reasons unexplained 
 I need to find the truth 
 But, see, what will I do?

95,Michael Jackson,pop,Gone Too Soon,"Like a comet 
 Blazing 'cross the evening sky 
 Gone too soon 
 Like a rainbow 
 Fading in the twinkling of an eye 
 Gone too soon 
 Shiny and sparkly 
 And splendidly bright 
 Here one day 
 Gone one night 
 Like the loss of sunlight 
 On a cloudy afternoon 
 Gone too soon 
 Like a castle 
 Built upon a sandy beach 
 Gone too soon 
 Like a perfect flower 
 That is just beyond your reach 
 Gone too soon 
 Born to amuse, to inspire, to delight 
 Here one day 
 Gone one night 
 Like a sunset 
 Dying with the rising of the moon 
 Gone too soon 
 Gone too soon"
96,Michael Jackson,pop,Dangerous,"The way she came into the place, I knew right then and there 
 There was something different about this girl, the way she moved 
 Her hair, her face, her lines, divinity in motion 
 As she stalked the room, I could feel the aura of her presence 
 Every head turned, feeling passion and lust 
 The girl was persuasive, the girl I could not trust 
 The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous 
 I never knew but I was walking the line 
 Come go with me, I said I have no time 
 And don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone 
 My baby cried, she left me standing alone 
 She's so dangerous, the girl is so dangerous 
 Take away my money, throw away my time 
 You can call me honey but you're no damn good for me 
 She came at me in sections with the eyes of desire 
 I fell trapped into her web of sin 
 A touch, a kiss, a whisper of love 
 I was at the point of no return 
 Deep in the darkness of passion's insanity 
 I felt taken by lust's, strange inhumanity 
 This girl was persuasive, this girl I could not trust 
 The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous 
 I never knew but I was living in vain 
 She called my house, she said you know my name 
 And don't you pretend you never did me before 
 With tears in her eyes, my baby walked out the door 
 She's so dangerous, the girl is so dangerous 
 Take away my money, throw away my time 
 You can call me honey but you're no damn good for me 
 Dangerous, the girl is so dangerous 
 I have to pray to God 
 'Cause I know how lust can blind 
 It's a passion in my soul 
 But you're no damn lover friend of mine 
 I can not sleep alone tonight 
 My baby left me here tonight 
 I can not cope till it's all right 
 You and your manipulation 
 You hurt my baby 
 And then it happened, she touched me 
 For the lips of a strange woman, drop as a honeycomb 
 And her mouth was smoother than oil 
 But her inner spirit and words 
 Were as sharp as a two-edged sword 
 But I loved it 'cause it's dangerous 
 She's so dangerous, the girl is so dangerous 
 Take away my money, throw away my time 
 You can call me honey but you're no damn good for me 
 She's so dangerous, the girl is so dangerous 
 Take away my money, throw away my time 
 You can call me honey but you're no damn good for me 
 She's so dangerous, the girl is so dangerous 
 Take away my money, throw away my time 
 You can call me honey but you're no damn good for me 
 Dangerous, the girl is so dangerous 
 I have to pray to God 
 'Cause I know how lust can blind 
 It's a passion in my soul 
 But you're no damn lover friend of mine"

 Lie for it 
 Spy for it 
 Kill for it 
 Die for it 
 So you call it trust but I say it's just 
 In the devil's game of greed and lust 
 They don't care, they'd do me for the money 
 They don't care, they use me for the money 
 So you go to church, read the holy word 
 In the scheme of life it's all absurd 
 They don't care, they'd kill for the money 
 Do or dare, the thrill for the money 
 You're saluting the flag, your country trusts you 
 Now you're wearing a badge, you're called the ""Just Few"" 
 And you're fighting the wars a soldier must do 
 I'll never betray or deceive you my friend but... 
 If you show me the cash then I will take it 
 If you tell me to cry then I will fake it 
 If you give me a hand then I will shake it 
 You'll do anything for money 
 Anything, anything 
 Anything for money 
 Would lie for you, would die for you, ah 
 Even sell my soul to the devil, ah 
 Anything, anything 
 Anything for money 
 Would lie for you, would die for you, ah 
 Even sell my soul to the devil 
 Insurance? Where do your loyalties lie? 
 Is that your alibi? I don't think so 
 You don't care, you'd do her for the money 
 Say it's fair, you sue her for the money 
 Want your pot of gold, need the Midas touch 
 Bet you sell your soul 'cause your God is such 
 You don't care, you kill for the money 
 Do or dare, the thrill for the money 
 Are you infected with the same disease of lust, gluttoney and greed? 
 Then watch the ones with the biggest smiles, the idle jabbers... 
 'Cause they're the backstabbers 
 If you know it's a lie then you will swear it 
 If you give it with guilt then you will bear it 
 If it's taking a chance then you will dare it 
 You'll do anything for money 
 Anything, anything 
 Anything for money 
 Would lie for you, would die for you, ah

 If you ask me to lie then I will tell him 
 If you're stealing with God then you will hell him 
 You'll do anything for money

 How could this be, you're not here with me 
 You never said goodbye, someone tell me why 
 Did you have to go and leave my world so cold 
 Every day I sit and ask myself, how did love slip away 
 Something whispers in my ear and says 
 That you are not alone, I am here with you 
 Though you're far away, I am here to stay 
 You are not alone, I am here with you 
 Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart 
 You are not alone 
 Alone, all alone, why, alone 
 Just the other night, I thought I heard you cry 
 Asking me to come and hold you in my arms 
 I can hear your prayers, your burdens I will bear 
 But first I need your hand, then forever can begin 
 Every day I sit and ask myself, how did love slip away 
 Then something whispers in my ear and says 
 That you are not alone, I am here with you 
 Though you're far away, I am here to stay 
 You are not alone, I am here with you 
 Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart 
 You are not alone 
 Oh, whisper three words and I'll come running, darling 
 And, girl, you know that I'll be there, I'll be there 
 That you are not alone, I am here with you 
 Though you're far away, I am here to stay 
 You are not alone, I am here with you 
 Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart 
 That you are not alone, I am here with you 
 Though you're far away, I am here to stay 
 For you are not alone, for I am here with you 
 Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart 
 For you are not alone 
 You are not alone, you are not alone 
 Said again, you are not alone, you are not alone 
 Not alone, not alone 
 Did you raise for me, girl 
 In the morning, in the evening 
 Not alone, not alone, you and me, not alone 
 Together, together"

 I'm searching for the world that I come from 
 'Cause I've been looking around 
 In the lost and found of my heart... 
 No one understands me 
 They view it as such strange eccentricities... 
 'Cause I keep kidding around 
 Like a child, but pardon me... 
 People say I'm not okay 
 'Cause I love such elementary things... 
 It's been my fate to compensate, 
 For the Childhood 
 I've never known... 
 Have you seen my Childhood? 
 I'm searching for that wonder in my youth 
 Like pirates in adventurous dreams, 
 Of conquest and kings on the throne... 
 Before you judge me, try hard to love me, 
 Look within your heart then ask, 
 Have you seen my Childhood? 
 People say I'm strange that way 
 'Cause I love such elementary things, 
 It's been my fate to compensate, 
 For the Childhood I've never known... 
 Have you seen my Childhood? 
 I'm searching for that wonder in my youth 
 Like fantastical stories to share 
 The dreams I would dare, watch me fly... 
 Before you judge me, try hard to love me. 
 The painful youth I've had 
 Have you seen my Childhood..."

 The girl with the tune 
 Who sings in the daytime at noon 
 She was there screaming 
 Beating her voice in her doom 
 But nobody came too soon... 
 A fall down the stairs 
 Her dress torn 
 Oh the blood in her hair... 
 A mystery so sullen in air 
 She lie there so tenderly 
 Fashioned so slenderly 
 Lift her with care, 
 Oh the blood in her hair... 
 Everyone came to see 
 The girl that now is dead 
 So blind stare the eyes in her head... 
 And suddenly a voice from the crowd said 
 This girl lived in vain 
 Her face bear such agony, such strain... 
 But only the man from next door 
 Knew Little Susie and how he cried 
 As he reached down 
 To close Susie's eyes... 
 She lie there so tenderly 
 Fashioned so slenderly 
 Lift her with care 
 Oh the blood in her hair... 
 It was all for God's sake 
 For her singing the tune 
 For someone to feel her despair 
 To be damned to know hoping is dead and you're doomed 
 Then to scream out 
 And nobody's there... 
 She knew no one cared... 
 Father left home, poor mother died 
 Leaving Susie alone 
 Grandfather's soul too had flown... 
 No one to care 
 Just to love her 
 How much can one bear 
 Neglecting the needs in her prayers... 
 Neglection can kill 
 Like a knife in your soul 
 Oh it will 
 Little Susie fought so hard to live... 
 She lie there so tenderly 
 Fashioned so slenderly 
 Lift her with care 
 So young and so fair"

116,Michael Jackson,pop,Is It Scary,"There's a ghost out in the hall 
 There's a ghoul beneath the bed 
 Now it's coming through the walls 
 Now it's coming up the stairs 
 There's a spirit in the dark 
 Hear the beating of his heart 
 Can you feel it in the air 
 Ghosts be hiding everywhere 
 I'm gonna be 
 Exactly what you wanna see 
 It's you who's haunting me 
 Because you're wanting me 
 To be the stranger 
 In the night 
 Am I amusing you 
 But just confusing me? 
 Am I the beast 
 You visualized? 
 And if you wanna see 
 Eccentric oddities 
 I'll be grotesque 
 Before your eye 
 Let them all materialize 
 Is that scary for you baby 
 Am I scary for you oh boy 
 Is it scary for you big baby 
 Is it scary for you 
 You know the stranger is you 
 Is it scary for you big baby 
 There's a creaking in the floor 
 There's a creak behind the door 
 There's a rocking in the chair 
 But nobody's sitting there 
 There's a ghastly smell around 
 But nobody to be found 
 And a coffin inlay open 
 Where a restless soul is pokin' 
 I'm gonna be 
 Exactly what you gonna see 
 So did you come to me 
 To see your fantasies 
 Performed before 
 Your very eyes 
 A haunting ghostly treat 
 The ghoulish trickery 
 And spirits dancing 
 In the night 
 But if you came to see 
 The truth, the purity 
 It's here inside 
 A lonely heart 
 So let the performance start 
 Is that scary for you baby 
 Am I scary for you oh boy 
 Am I scary for you big baby 
 Am I scary for you oh boy 
 So tell me 
 Is it scary for you baby 
 Tell me 
 So tell me 
 Is that realism for you big baby 
 Am I scary for you 
 You know the stranger is you 
 Am I scary for ya 
 Masquerade the heart 
 Is the height of hurting souls 
 Just not what you see of me 
 Can hardly reveal the proof 
 Like a mirror reveals the truth 
 See the evil one is you 
 Is that scary for you big baby 
 Am I scary for you oh boy 
 Am I scary for you baby 
 Am I scary for you oh boy 
 So tell me 
 Am I scary for you baby 
 Am I scary for you baby 
 Is it scary for you baby 
 Am I scary for you oh boy 
 Wanna talk about 
 I wanna talk about 
 I don't wanna talk about

 You know you're scaring me too

 They use me for the money 
 So you go to church

 In the scheme of life 
 It's all absurd

 And you're fighting the wars

 I'll never betray or deceive you my friend but 
 If you show me the cash 
 Then I will take it 
 If you tell me to cry 
 Then I will fake it 
 If you give me a hand

 With the biggest smiles 
 The idle jabbers

123,Michael Jackson,pop,You Are Not Alone (Classic Club Mix),"Another day has gone 
 I'm still all alone 
 How could this be 
 You're not here with me 
 You never said goodbye 
 Someone tell me why 
 Did you have to go 
 And leave my world so cold 
 Everyday I sit and ask myself 
 How did love slip away 
 Something whispers in my ear and says 
 That you are not alone 
 For I am here with you 
 Though you're far away 
 I am here to stay 
 You are not alone 
 I am here with you 
 Though we're far apart 
 You're always in my heart 
 You are not alone 
 Alone, alone 
 Why, alone 
 Just the other night 
 I thought I heard you cry 
 Asking me to come 
 And hold you in my arms 
 I can hear your prayers 
 Your burdens I will bear 
 But first I need your hand 
 Then forever can begin 
 Everyday I sit and ask myself 
 How did love slip away 
 Something whispers in my ear and says 
 That you are not alone 
 For I am here with you 
 Though you're far away 
 I am here to stay 
 For you are not alone 
 And I am here with you 
 Though we're far apart 
 You're always in my heart 
 For you are not alone 
 Whisper three words 
 And I'll come runnin' 
 And I, girl you know that I'll be there 
 I'll be there 
 You are not alone 
 I am here with you 
 Though you're far away 
 I am here to stay 
 For you are not alone 
 I am here with you 
 Though we're far apart 
 You're always in my heart 
 For you are not alone 
 (You are not alone) 
 For I am here with you 
 (I am here with you) 
 Though you're far away 
 (Though you're far away) 
 (You and me) 
 I am here to stay 
 For you are not alone 
 (You are always in my heart) 
 For I am here with you 
 Though we're far apart 
 You're always in my heart 
 For you are not alone 
 Not alone, oh 
 (Alone) 
 You are not alone 
 You are not alone 
 Say it again 
 You are not alone 
 You are not alone 
 Not alone 
 Not alone 
 If you reach out for me, girl 
 In the morning, 
 In the evening 
 Not alone 
 Not alone 
 You and me, 
 Not alone, no 
 Together, 
 Together, 
 Gotta stop being alone, 
 Gotta stop being alone, 
 Believe in me, 
 Gotta stop being alone 
 Gotta stop being alone, 
 Gotta stop being alone, 
 Not alone, oh."

 Now I'm just wondering why you think 
 That you can get to me with anything 
 Seems like you'd know by now, when and how I get down 
 And with all that I've been through I'm still around 
 Don't you ever make no mistake 
 Baby I've got what it takes 
 And there's no way you'll ever get to me

 You'll never break me 'cause I'm unbreakable 
 You know that, I'm, ah, well 
 Now you can't stop me even though you think 
 That if you block me you've done your thing 
 And when you bury me underneath all your pain

126,Michael Jackson,pop,Heartbreaker,"Deceitful eyes, she's got those come get me thighs 
 She only knows how low that she can go 
 She speaks the lines that can control my mind 
 Wherever she goes I know my eyes follow 
 She blew a kiss, I swear that it was meant 
 Only for me, then spoke with her body 
 Her only goal is just to take control 
 And I can't believe that I can't tell her no 
 That girl I can't take her 
 Should have known she was a heartbreaker 
 That girl I can't take her 
 Should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker 
 That girl I can't take her 
 Should have seen it coming heartbreaker 
 That girl I can't take her 
 Should have seen right through her 
 She's a heartbreaker 
 She plays a game with such an innocent face 
 I didn't know heartbreaking was her case 
 Her actions confess and put me through the test 
 I was surprised that I was caught inside 
 Now she's thinking that I will never know 
 And she'll keep playing until I let her go 
 But I hope in time that she will finally realize 
 I'm onto her game and she'll get played the same 
 That girl I can't take her 
 Should have known she was a heartbreaker 
 That girl I can't take her 
 Should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker 
 That girl I can't take her 
 Should have seen it coming heartbreaker 
 That girl I can't take her 
 Should have seen right through her 
 She's a heartbreaker 
 That girl I can't take her 
 Should have known she was a heartbreaker 
 That girl I can't take her 
 Should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker 
 That girl I can't take her 
 Should have seen it coming heartbreaker 
 That girl I can't take her 
 Should have seen right through her 
 She's a heartbreaker 
 I never thought that I would stop dreamin' about you 
 Stop being without you 
 But everyone told me so, to stop caring about you 
 And start being without you 
 But I'll find a way to go and start doin' without you 
 And stop talkin' about you 
 And what will she say? 
 She will say I was the man that got away 
 You playing huh, I thought it was love with this game huh 
 When you're dealing with the emotions of pain huh 
 Take a closer look when you're dealing with a stranger 
 I can't change her, no 
 Heart murder in place then you'll see 
 A one hill from pepsi they see 
 One hard player, she's a star player 
 I need this crap huh 
 I didn't see the heartbreaker, so come on 
 That girl I can't take her 
 Should have known she was a heartbreaker 
 That girl I can't take her 
 Should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker 
 That girl I can't take her 
 Should have seen it coming heartbreaker 
 That girl I can't take her 
 Should have seen right through her

 When all I do is for you 
 But still you say it ain't cool 
 If there's somebody else 
 (He can't love you like me) 
 And he says he'll treat you well 
 (He can't treat you like me) 
 And he's buying diamonds and pearls

 Now some way I'll have to prove 
 All that I said I would do 
 Giving you everything 
 Fulfilling your fantasy 
 Then maybe you'll change your mind 
 And finally give in in time 
 Then I'll be showing you 
 What other men are supposed to do for you my baby 
 Don't mind me -- 
 Stop the frontin' I'm real with mine 
 All things that I promised I'll fulfill in time 
 Chains and the bracelets -- got to really shine 
 So many trips you'll have jet lag and still be fine 
 He can trade but his money ain't long enough 
 He can spin but his game ain't strong enough 
 Now the way you resist me? This ain't cool 
 It's like nothing chills the girl -- she's invincible 
 So why ain't you feelin' me -- come around 
 (She's invincible) 
 I can't do anything -- come on now 
 (She's invincible) 
 Even when I beg and plead -- come on now 
 (She's invincible) 
 Girl won't give in to me

 Why ain't you feelin' me

 Invincible -- please tell me

 All you gotta do is walk away and pass me by 
 Don't acknowledge my smile when I try to say hello to you yeah 
 And all you gotta do is not answer my calls when 
 I'm trying to get through 
 Keep me wondering why, when all I can do is sigh 
 I just wanna touch you 
 I just wanna touch and kiss and I wish that I could be with you 
 Tonight cause you give me butterflies inside inside and i 
 All I gotta say is that I must be dreaming, can't be real 
 You're not here with me, still I can feel you near me 
 I caress you, let you taste us, just so blissful listen 
 I would give you anything baby, just make my dreams come true 
 Oh baby you give me butterflies 
 I just wanna touch and kiss and I wish that I could be with you 
 Tonight cause you give me butterflies inside inside and i 
 I just wanna touch and kiss and I wish that I could be with you 
 Tonight cause you give me butterflies inside inside and i 
 If you would take my hand, baby I would show you 
 Guide you to the light babe 
 If you would be my love, baby I will love you, love you 
 Till the end of time 
 I just wanna touch and kiss and I wish that I could be with you

132,Michael Jackson,pop,Speechless,"Your love is magical, that's how I feel 
 But I have not the words here to explain 
 Gone is the grace for expressions of passion 
 But there are worlds and worlds of ways to explain 
 To tell you how I feel 
 But I am speechless, speechless 
 That's how you make me feel 
 Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is for real 
 When I'm with you I am lost for words, I don't know what to say 
 My head's spinning like a carousel, so silently I pray 
 Helpless and hopeless, that's how I feel inside 
 Nothing's real, but all is possible if God is on my side 
 When I'm with you I am in the light where I cannot be found 
 It's as though I am standing in the place called Hallowed Ground 
 Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel 
 Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is for real 
 I'll go anywhere and do anything just to touch your face 
 There's no mountain high I cannot climb 
 I'm humbled in your grace 
 Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel 
 Though I'm with you I am lost for words and nothing is for real 
 Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel 
 Though I'm with you I am far away, and nothing is for real 
 Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel 
 Though I'm with you I am lost for words and nothing is for real 
 Speechless 
 Your love is magical, that's how I feel 
 But in your presence I am lost for words 
 Words like, ""I love you."""

 The man I really am 
 You keep on stalking me

 To get that message across 
 That yet you haven't heard 
 My friend was chased and confused 
 Like many others I knew 
 But on that cold winter night 
 My pride was snatched away 
 She get no second chance 
 She ridiculed and harassed 
 Please tell me why 
 Oh no

 Respect's not given, it's earned 
 Stop maliciously attacking my integrity

 And how can I stop losing you 
 How can I begin to say 
 When there's nothing left to do but walk away 
 Yeah 
 I close my eyes 
 Just to try and see you smile one more time 
 But it's been so long now all I do is cry 
 Can't we find some love to take this away 
 'Cause the pain gets stronger every day 
 How can I begin again 
 How am I to understand 
 When there's nothing left to do but walk away

 Someone is hiding the truth (Hold on) 
 When will this mystery unfold 
 And will the sun ever shine 
 In the blind man's eyes when he cries 
 You can change the world (I can't do it by myself) 
 You can touch the sky (It's gonna take somebody's help) 
 You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign) 
 If we all cry at the same time tonight 
 If people laugh when they're feeling sad 
 Someone is taking a life (Hold on) 
 Respect to believe in your dreams 
 So tell me where were you 
 When your children cried last night 
 Faces filled with madness 
 Miracles unheard of (Hold on) 
 Faith is found in the winds 
 All we have to do is to reach for the truth, the truth 
 You can change the world (I can't do it by myself) 
 You can touch the sky (It's gonna take somebody's help) 
 You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign) 
 If we all cry at the same time tonight 
 And when that flag glows there'll be no more wars 
 And when all 'cause I will answer all your prayers (Prayers) 
 Show the world...

 But not for the missing 
 So this one's for all the lost children 
 This one's for all the lost children 
 This one's for all the lost children, wishing them well 
 And wishing them home 
 When you sit there addressing, counting your blessings 
 Biding your time 
 When you lay me down sleeping and my heart is weeping 
 Because I'm keeping a place 
 For all the lost children 
 This is for all the lost children 
 This one's for all the lost children, wishing them well 
 And wishing them home 
 Home with their fathers, 
 Snug close and warm, loving their mothers 
 I see the door simply wide open 
 But no one can find it 
 So pray for all the lost children 
 Let's pray for all the lost children 
 Just think of all the lost children, wishing them well 
 This is for all the lost children 
 This one's for all the lost children 
 Just think of all the lost children

 Everything will be alright, he assures her 
 But she doesn't hear a word that he says 
 Preoccupied, she's afraid 
 Afraid what they've been doin's not right

140,Michael Jackson,pop,Threatened,"Tonight's story is somewhat unique and calls for a different kind of 
 Introduction 
 A monster had arrived in the village 
 The major ingredient of any recipe for fear is the unknown 
 And this person or thing is soon to be met 
 He knows every thought, he can feel every emotion 
 Oh yes, I did forget something didn't I? 
 I forgot to introduce you to the monster. 
 You're fearing me, 'cause you know I'm a beast 
 Watching you when you sleep, when you're in bed I'm underneath 
 You're trapped in halls, and my face is the walls 
 I'm the floor when you fall, and when you scream it's 'cause of me 
 I'm the living dead, the dark thoughts in your head 
 I know just what you said 
 That's why you've got to be threatened by me 
 You should be watching me, you should feel threatened 
 Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be threatened 
 Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened 
 Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me 
 You think you're by yourself, but it's my touch you felt 
 I'm not a ghost from Hell, but I've got a spell on you 
 Your worst nightmare, it's me I'm everywhere 
 In one blink I'll disappear, and then I'll come back to haunt you 
 I'm telling you, when you lie under tomb I'm the one watching you 
 That's why you got to be threatened by me 
 You should be watching me, you should feel threatened 
 Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be threatened 
 Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened 
 Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me 
 The unknown monster is about to embark 
 From a far corner, out of the dark 
 A nightmare, that's the case 
 Never Neverland, that's the place 
 This particular monster can read minds 
 Be in two places at the same time 
 This is judgment night, execution, slaughter 
 The devil, ghosts, this monster is torture 
 You can be sure of one thing, that's fate 
 A human presence that you feel is strange 
 A monster that you can see disappear 
 A monster, the worst thing to fear. 
 You should be watching me, you should feel threatened 
 Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be threatened 
 Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened 
 Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me 
 You should be watching me, you should feel threatened 
 Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be threatened 
 Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened 
 Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me 
 You should be watching me, you should feel threatened 
 Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be threatened 
 Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened 
 Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me 
 What you have just witnessed could be the end of a particularly 
 Terrifying nightmare. It isn't. It's the beginning."

 The word's got out that you're on the line 
 On the move 
 Got fever in your shoes 
 The night's on you, what are you gonna do? 
 Sunset driver 
 Midnight rider 
 Friday's brighter 
 Just to reach that driver 
 The Saturday-nighter, aow!"
144,Michael Jackson,pop,Scared Of The Moon,"Alone she lays waiting 
 Surrounded by gloom 
 Inflated by shadows 
 Painting the room 
 The light from the window 
 Cuts trough the air 
 And pins the child lying there 
 Scared of the moon 
 She pulls up the curtain 
 And shivers in fright 
 She hides from the colours 
 That rides on the night 
 The light through the window 
 That lights up the sky 
 And causes her moanfull cry 
 Scared of the moon 
 There's nothing wrong 
 Don't be bothered they said 
 It's just childish fantasies turning your head 
 No need to worry 
 It's really too soon 
 But there she lies shivering 
 Scared of the moon 
 Scared of the moon 
 Scared of the moon 
 Scared of the moon 
 Scared of the moon 
 The years go by swiftly 
 And soon childhood ends 
 But life is still fearful 
 When evening descends 
 The fear of a child 
 Still intrude the night 
 Returning on beams of light 
 Scared of the moon 
 The feeling of terror 
 She felt as a youth 
 Has turned from a fantasy 
 Into the truth 
 The moon is the enemy 
 Twisting her soul 
 And taking its fearful tone 
 Scared of the moon 
 But now there are others who sit here alone 
 And wait for the sunlight to brighten their gloom 
 Together they gather 
 The loners see shade 
 But knowing just why they're scared 
 Scared of the moon 
 Scared of the moon 
 Scared of the moon 
 Scared of the moon 
 Scared of the moon"
145,Michael Jackson,pop,We Are The World (Demo),"There is a time when we should hear the certain calls 
 'Cause the world it seems it's right in this line 
 'Cause there's a chance for taking in needing our own lives 
 It seems we need nothing at all 
 I used to feel I should give away my heart 
 And it shows that fear of needing them 
 Then I read the headlines and it said they're dying there 
 And it shows that we must heed instead 
 We are the world 
 We are the children 
 We are the ones who make a brighter day 
 So let's start giving 
 There's a chance we're taking 
 We're taking our own lives 
 It's true we'll make a brighter day 
 Just you and me 
 Give in your heart and you will see that someone cares 
 'Cause you know that they can feed them all 
 Then I read the paper and it said that you've been denied 
 And it shows the second we will call 
 We are the world 
 We are the children 
 We are the ones who make a brighter day 
 So let's start giving 
 There's a chance we're taking 
 We're taking our own lives 
 It's true we'll make a brighter day 
 Just you and me 
 Now there's a time when we must love them all 
 And it seems that life, it don't make love at all 
 But if you'd been there, and I'll love you more and more 
 It seems in life, I didn't do that 
 We are the world, the world 
 We are the children, are the children 
 We are the ones who make a brighter day 
 So let's start giving, let's start giving 
 There's a chance we're taking 
 We're taking our own lives 
 It's true we'll make a brighter day 
 Just you and me 
 We are the world, are the world 
 We are the children, are the children 
 We are the ones who make a brighter day 
 So let's start giving, let's start giving 
 But there's a chance we're taking, taking 
 We're taking our own lives 
 It's true we'll make a brighter day 
 Just you and me 
 We are the world, shalom 
 We are the children, shalingin 
 We are the ones who make a brighter day, shalom 
 So let's start giving, 'cause that's what we're being 
 There's a chance we're taking 
 We're taking our own lives 
 It's true we'll make a brighter day 
 Just you and me 
 Come on, yeah 
 We are the world, shalom

149,Michael Jackson,pop,Who Is It (IHS Mix),"I gave her money 
 I gave her time 
 I gave her everything 
 Inside one heart could find 
 I gave her passion

 And secrets so untold 
 And she promised me forever 
 And a day we'd live as one 
 We made our vows 
 We'd live a life anew

150,Michael Jackson,pop,Someone Put Your Hand Out,"Never try to talk about it 
 It's got to sound good to me inside 
 I just think about it 
 I'm so undemanding 
 'Cause they say love is blind 
 I've lived this life pretending 
 I can bear this hurt deep inside 
 The truth is that I'm longing 
 For love that's so divine 
 I've searched this whole world wishing 
 She'll be there time after time 
 So someone put your hand out 
 I'm begging for your love 
 All I do is hand out a heart that needs your love 
 I've lived my life the lonely 
 A soul that cries of shame 
 With handicapped emotions 
 Save me now from what still remains 
 I'll be your story hero 
 A serenading ryne 
 I'm just needing that someone 
 Save me now from the path I'm on... 
 Someone put your hand out 
 I'm begging for your love 
 'Cause all I do is hand out a heart that needs your love 
 Someone put your hand out 
 I'm begging for your love 
 All I do is hand out a heart that needs your love 
 When you say we will dance 'til the light of day 
 It's just like the children in earth's joy 
 When we pray will you promise me you'll always stay 
 It's because I'm needing that someone 
 Someone put your hand out 
 I'm begging for your love 
 'Cause all I do is hand out a heart that needs your love 
 Someone put your hand out 
 I'm begging for your love 
 All I do is hand out 
 Someone put your hand out 
 I'm begging for your love 
 All I do is hand out

 Hard times just don't go away 
 You gotta take that chip off your shoulder

 Have some faith 
 Nothing good ever comes easy 
 All good things come in due time 
 Yes it does 
 You gotta have something to believe in 
 I'm telling you to open your mind 
 Gotta put your heart on the line 
 If you wanna make it right 
 You've got to reach out and try 
 Gotta put your heart on the line 
 If you wanna make it right 
 Gotta put it all on the line 
 You see yourself in the mirror 
 And you don't like what you see 
 And things aren't getting much clearer 
 Don't you think it's time you go for a change 
 Don't waste your time on the past, no, no 
 It's time you look to the future 
 It's all right there if you ask 
 This time if you try much harder 
 You'll be the best that you can be 
 If you wanna make it right 
 If you wanna do it now 
 You gotta learn to try 
 You can make it right somehow 
 Let love come free 
 And that's just so easy now 
 You gotta go for what you want 
 You gotta do what you got to do

156,Michael Jackson,pop,We've Had Enough,"Love was taken from a young life 
 And no one told her why 
 Her direction has a dimlight 
 From one more violent crime 
 She innocently questioned why 
 Why her father had to die 
 She asked the men in blue 
 How is it that you get to choose 
 Who will live and who will die 
 Did god say that you could decide? 
 You saw he didn't run 
 And then my daddy had no gun 
 In the middle of a village 
 Within a distant land 
 Lies a poor boy with his broken toy 
 Too young to understand 
 He's awaken, ground is shaking 
 His father grabs his hand 
 Screaming crying, his wife's dying 
 Now he's left to explain 
 He innocently questioned why 
 Why his mother had to die 
 What did these soldiers come here for? 
 If they're for peace why is there war? 
 Did god say that they could decide 
 Who will live and who will die? 
 All my mama ever did 
 Was try to take care of her kids 
 We're innocently standing by 
 Watching people losing lives 
 It seems as if we have no voice 
 It's time for us to make a choice 
 Only god could decide 
 Who will live and who will die 
 There's nothing that can't be done 
 If we raise our voice as one 
 Did God hear it from me? 
 Did God hear it from you? 
 Did God hear it from us? 
 We can't take it 
 We've already had enough 
 Did God hear it from me? 
 Did God hear it from you? 
 Did God hear it from us? 
 We can't take it 
 We've already had enough 
 Did God hear it from me? 
 Did God hear it from you? 
 Did God hear it from you baby? 
 We can't take it 
 (We've already had enough) 
 Deep in my soul baby 
 Deep in your soul and by your side 
 Deep in my soul 
 It's so big and I'm still alive 
 Did God hear it from us? 
 Whoooooo! 
 We can't take it 
 We've already had enough 
 It's going down baby 
 Just let God decide, 
 It's going on baby 
 Just let God decide 
 Deep in my soul baby 
 We've already had enough 
 Did God hear it from me? 
 Did God hear it from you?

158,Michael Jackson,pop,Planet Earth,"Planet Earth, my home, my place 
 A capricious anomaly in the sea of space 
 Planet Earth are you just 
 Floating by, a cloud of dust 
 A minor globe, about to bust 
 A piece of metal bound to rust 
 A speck of matter in a mindless void 
 A lonely spaceship, a large asteroid 
 Cold as a rock without a hue 
 Held together with a bit of glue 
 Something tells me this isn't true 
 You are my sweetheart, soft and blue 
 Do you care, have you a part 
 In the deepest emotions of my own heart 
 Tender with breezes caressing and whole 
 Alive with music, haunting my soul. 
 In my veins I've felt the mystery 
 Of corridors of time, books of history 
 Life songs of ages throbbing in my blood 
 Have danced the rhythm of the tide and flood 
 Your misty clouds, your electric storm 
 Were turbulent tempests in my own form 
 I've licked the salt, the bitter, the sweet 
 Of every encounter, of passion, of heat 
 Your riotous color, your fragrance, your taste 
 Have thrilled my senses beyond all haste 
 In your beauty, I've known the how 
 Of timeless bliss, this moment of now 
 Planet Earth, are you just 
 Floating by, a cloud of dust 
 A minor globe, about to bust 
 A piece of metal bound to rust 
 A speck of matter in a mindless void 
 A lonely spaceship, a large asteroid 
 Cold as a rock without a hue 
 Held together with a bit of glue 
 Something tells me this isn't true 
 You are my sweetheart, gentle and blue 
 Do you care, have you a part 
 In the deepest emotions of my own heart 
 Tender with breezes caressing and whole 
 Alive with music, haunting my soul 
 Planet Earth, gentle and blue 
 With all my heart, I love you"

 Take away this never ending sorrow 
 Take this lonely feeling from my soul 
 If only I knew what things bring tomorrow 
 She'd be sitting here beside me 
 And my heart would fill with gold 
 I hope to make a change now 
 For the better

 With you at work and the kids at school

 She lied to you, lied to me 
 Because she had a family, family

171,Michael Jackson,pop,Loving You,"Hello, August moon, where are the stars of the night? 
 You promised me too soon, 'cause it's been cloudy all night 
 And the weatherman said if you're not well, stay in bed 
 'Cause I've been feeling down and blue and it's cloudy in my head 
 Instead of going out to some restaurant, I stay home in bed 
 But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do 
 I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do 
 Hello, midnight lover, you're the one I adore 
 And I'll be thinking of you 'til the stars are no more 
 If it's cloudy or blue, I'll stay here with you 
 We'll make a wish, and then we'll kiss, a love forever true 
 Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay here with you 
 But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do 
 I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do 
 It seems you don't know we reached the heightened mountain 
 Every time I seem to disappear 
 And together, we will fly, we'll dance up in the heaven 
 I can really feel it when you're near 
 And the weatherman said if you're not well, stay in bed 
 'Cause I've been feeling down and blue and it's cloudy in my head 
 Instead of going out to some restaurant, I stay home in bed 
 But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do 
 I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do 
 But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do

172,Michael Jackson,pop,A Place With No Name,"As I drove across on the highway 
 My jeep began to rock 
 I didn't know what to do so I stopped and got out 
 And looked down and noticed I got a flat 
 So I walked out, parked the car like sideways 
 So I can find what I can fix 
 I looked around there were no cars on the highway 
 I felt a strange feeling like a mist 
 I walked down towards the end of the road 
 And in the fog a woman appeared 
 She said don't you worry my friend I'll take care 
 Take my hand, I'll take you there 
 Oh 
 Take me to a place without no name 
 Take me to a place without no name 
 Take me to a place without no name 
 Take me to a place without no name 
 As she took me right through the fog 
 I see a beautiful city appear 
 Where kids are playin' and people are laughin' and smiling and 
 Nothing to fear 
 She said this is the place where no people have pain 
 With love and happiness 
 She turned around looked down at my eyes and started cryin' 
 She grabbed my hand, you've got a friend 
 Oh 
 Take me to a place without no name (no name) 
 Take me to a place without no name (a place without no name) 
 Take me to a place without no name 
 Take me to a place without no name 
 Oh 
 Yeah 
 She started likin' me kissin' me and huggin' me 
 She didn't really, really want me to leave 
 She showed me places I've never seen, things I've never done 
 This really looks like a lotta fun 
 I seen the grass and the sky and the birds 
 And the flowers surrounded by the trees 
 This place is filled with love and happiness 
 How in the world could I wanna leave 
 So then I went in my pocket took my wallet on out 
 With my pictures of my family and girl 
 This is the place that you choose to be with me 
 When you thought you could be in another world 
 Oh 
 Take me to a place without no name (no name) 
 Take me to a place without no name 
 Take me to a place without no name (a place without no name) 
 Take me to a place without no name 
 No No No

 She works so hard, just to make her way 
 For a man who just don't appreciate 
 And though he takes her love in vain 
 Still she could not stop, couldn't break his chains 
 She danced the night that they fell out 
 She swore she'd dance no more 
 But dance she did, he did not quit 
 As she ran out the door 
 She danced through the night in fear of her life 
 She danced to a beat of her own 
 She let out a cry and swallowed her pride 
 She knew she was needed back home, home 
 She's a slave to the rhythm 
 She's a slave to the rhythm of 
 She's a slave to the rhythm 
 A a slave to the rhythm of 
 The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love"

 He's taking her on the streets, of Sunset Boulevard

182,Michael Jackson,pop,Mind Is The Magic,"Mind Is The Magic 
 Come in to me 
 I know mystical garden 
 Orchards and violets 
 All mysteries are parted 
 Life is a mirageghost 
 Imagination 
 Pure inspiration called justification 
 Nothing's impossible 
 Nothing's concealed 
 Everything here is for real 
 What gives fantastic ghouls all in your head? 
 Who creates wonders like nobody can? 
 Siegfried and Roy 
 You know it's 
 Siegfried and Roy 
 So be it 
 Siegfried and Roy 
 I'm gonna... 
 Siegfried and Roy 
 When it's Siegfried and Roy 
 It's the mind of a magic in true 
 Your own thoughts play the game 
 In the magical wonders they do 
 The mind in the magic is you 
 Move of the head 
 And I'll change your emotions 
 Strange things appear 
 From euphorics, devotions 
 Everything's happening 
 Nothing's unreal 
 Hallucinating the mind in the real 
 Seeing black panthers 
 That suddenly fly 
 White tigers stalking your mind 
 Hallucinating the things that you see 
 This kind of magic's so hard to believe 
 'Cause when it's Siegfried and Roy 
 It's the mind of a magic in true 
 Your own thoughts play the game 
 In the magical wonders they do 
 The mind in the magic is you 
 When it's Siegfried and Roy 
 It's the mind of a magic in true 
 When it's Siegfried and Roy 
 It's the mind of a magic in true 
 (Seeing is believin'...) 
 When it's Siegfried and Roy 
 It's the mind of a magic in true 
 Hallucinations 
 The game of this kind 
 This kind of magic 
 Throws mind"
183,Michael Jackson,pop,Shout,"Shout 
 Ignorance of people purchasing diamonds and necklaces, 
 And barely able to keep the payments up on their lessons, 
 And enrolled in a class and don't know who the professor is, 
 How low people go for the dough and make a mess of things, 
 Kids are murdering other kids for the fun of it, 
 Instead of using their mind or their fist, they put a gun in it 
 Wanna be a part of a clique, don't know who's running it, 
 Tragedy on top of tragedy you know it's killing me. 
 So many people in agony, this shouldn't have to be, 
 Too busy focusing on ourselves and not His Majesty, 
 There has to be some type of change for this day and age, 
 We gotta rearrange and flip the page, 
 Living encaged like animals and cannibals, 
 Eating each other alive just to survive the nine to five, 
 Every single day is trouble while we struggle and strive 
 Peace of mind's so hard to find. 
 I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout 
 What's this madness all about 
 All this makes me wanna shout 
 You know it makes me wanna shout, 
 Throw my hands up and shout 
 What's this madness all about 
 All this makes me wanna shout, c'mon now 
 Problems, complications and accusations 
 Dividing the nations and races of empty faces 
 A war is taking place. 
 No substitution for restitution, the only solution for peace 
 Is increasing the height of your spirituality. 
 Masses of minds are shrouded, clouded visions 
 Deceptions and indecision, no faith or religion, how we're living. 
 The clock is ticking, the end is coming, there'll be no warning, 
 But we live to see the dawn. 
 How can we preach, when all we make this world to be 
 Is a living hell torturing our minds. 
 We all must unite, to turn darkness to light, 
 And the love in our hearts will shine. 
 We're disconnected from love, we're disrespecting each other 
 Whatever happened to protecting each other 
 Poisoned your body and your soul for a minute of pleasure, 
 But the damage that you've done is gonna last forever. 
 Babies being born in the world already drug addicted and afflicted, 
 Family values are contradicted. 
 Ashes to ashes and dust to dust, the pressure is building and I've had enough."

185,Michael Jackson,pop,Dangerous (Live),"The way she came into the place I knew right then and there, 
 There was something different about this girl. 
 The way she moved, 
 Her hair, her face, her lines, 
 Divinity in motion. 
 As she stalked the room I could feel the aura of her presence. 
 Every head turned feeling passion and lust. 
 The girl was persuasive, 
 The girl I could not trust. 
 The girl was bad. 
 The girl was dangerous. 
 She came at me in sections, 
 With the eyes of desire. 
 I fell trapped into her web of sin. 
 A touch, a kiss, a whisper of love, 
 I was at the point of no return. 
 Deep in the darkness of passion's insanity, 
 I felt taken by lust's strange inhumanity. 
 This girl was persuasive, 
 This girl I could not trust. 
 The girl was bad. 
 The girl was dangerous. 
 You've been hit by, 
 You've been struck by, 
 A Smooth Criminal.

 Dangerous. 
 The girl is so dangerous. 
 Take away my money, 
 Throw away my time. 
 You can call me honey, 
 But you're no d*** good for me. 
 Dangerous. 
 The girl is so dangerous. 
 I have to pray to God, 
 'Cause I know that lust can blind. It's a passion in my soul, 
 But you're no d*** lover friend of mine.

186,Michael Jackson,pop,"Elizabeth, I Love You","Welcome to Hollywood 
 That's what they told you 
 A child star in Hollywood 
 That's what they sold you 
 Grace with beauty, charme and talent 
 You would do what you were told 
 But they robbed you of childhood 
 Took your youth and sold it for gold 
 Elizabeth, I love you 
 You're every star that shines in the world to me 
 Elizabeth can't you see that it's true 
 Elizabeth, I love you 
 You're more than just a star to me 
 Lovely Elizabeth 
 You have surpassed them all 
 My friend Elizabeth 
 Learned to outlast them all 
 Many started back when you did 
 Lost their way and now they're gone 
 But look at you, a true survivor 
 Full of life and carrying on 
 This is your life 
 You seem to have it all 
 You reached your peak 
 They wanted you to fall 
 It's very sad, this world can be so bad 
 But though all the heartaches 
 When they put you down 
 You know you were the victor 
 And you earned the crown 
 It's like walking through the fire 
 Determinded to win 
 You were beating life's battles 
 Again and again 
 Elizabeth, I love you 
 You're every star that shines in the world to me 
 Elizabeth can't you see that it's true 
 Remember the time I was alone 
 You stood by my side and said: 
 ""Let's be strong"" 
 You did all these tings 
 That only a true friend can do 
 Elizabeth, I love you 
 The world knows your work now 
 I pray one day I'll be just like... you."

 ""My footsteps broke the silence of the pre-dawn hours as I drifted down Bleaker Street, past shop windows, barred against the perils of the night. Up ahead, a neon sign emerged from the fog.

 You were there, before we came. 
 You took the hurt, you took the shame. 
 They built the walls to block your way. 
 You beat them down. 
 You won the day. 
 It wasn't right, it wasn't fair. 
 You taught them all. 
 You made them care. 
 Yes, you were there, and thanks to you 
 There's now a door we all walk through. 
 And we are here, for all to see -- 
 To be the best that we can be. 
 Yes, I am here... 
 Because you were there."

 I live in a fantasy 
 Because I see the world 
 Differently 
 Visions come to me 
 In my sleep 
 I closed my eyes 
 To see what God is showing me 
 Close your eyes 
 And imagine with me 
 See the wonder 
 In every living thing 
 If we can live our lives 
 The way it is in my dreams 
 Love will take us to a place where 
 God can be seen 
 This is my dream 
 I have this dream 
 This I believe 
 The world a place for all humanity 
 If we could take love to it's highest level 
 More than the world has ever seen 
 I have this dream 
 Let's put Gods love opn display 
 Angel of love come my way 
 It really up to you and me 
 One world together in harmony 
 In my dream I see heaven 
 And the face of the one perfect being 
 I see people turning into angels 
 And God giving them their wings 
 This is my dream 
 I have this dream 
 This I believe 
 The world's a place 
 For all humanity 
 If we could take love 
 To it's highest level 
 More than the world has ever seen 
 I have this dream

 Made our love stronger with each day 
 And the fears that haunted me 
 Seemed like a million miles away.

 With lies about your love 
 I'd tell them happiness and sunny skies 
 Are all we're thinking of 
 We're so in love 
 We're thinking of.

 And imagine with me 
 See the wonder 
 In every living thing 
 If we can life 
 The way it is in my dreams 
 Love will take us to a place where 
 God can be seen 
 This is my dream 
 I have this dream 
 This I believe 
 The world a place for all humanity 
 If we could take love to it's highest level 
 More than the world has ever seen 
 I have this dream 
 Let's put Gods love on display 
 Angel of love come my way 
 It really up to you and me 
 One world together in harmony 
 In my dream I see heaven 
 And the face of the one perfect being 
 I see people turning into angels 
 And God giving them their wings

 For all humanity

 To take a second look

 Standing there before you 
 Accept this Hajj of mine 
 Standing in ihram, making my tawaf 
 Drinking blessings from your well 
 The challenges that I have suffered 
 Rekindles my imaan 
 O Allah! I am waiting for the call 
 Praying for the day when I can be near the Kabah wall 
 O Allah! I am waiting for the call 
 Praying for the day when I can be near Your Kabah wall 
 I feel alive and I feel strong 
 I can feel Islam running in my Veins 
 To see my Muslim brothers, their purpose all the same 
 Greeting one another, exalting one True Name 
 I truly hope one day that everyone's a Muslim. 
 That they remember you in everything they say 
 Standing in ihram making my tawaf, making my tawaf 
 Drinking blessings from your well 
 The challenges that I have suffered 
 Rekindles my imaan

 Ooh girl.

 That things were through with us. 
 I have a hard time feelin' within. 
 Just started moving on. 
 Got back my feeling chilling. Started chilling getting back with it. 
 Now I seem to be every where lately 
 Too much to be coincidentally 
 Why you wanna lead me on, 
 I'm not the one you want 
 So girl don't keep me hangin' 
 You won't let me let go 
 Got me thinking it's on

 Goodbye don't mean hello 
 Love, you leave me alone 
 You won?t! You won't let me let go 
 Ooh yeah 
 When we started datin? makin' 
 Moves on the single scene 
 Never seen you so jealous 
 Tellin' all the other girls that you're still with me 
 You may think its funny hunnie 
 I ain't laughin' 
 You know what I think about it 
 Now I seem to be every where lately 
 To much to be coincidentally,

244,Michael Jackson,pop,Lost Children,"We pray for our fathers, pray for our mothers 
 Wishing our families well 
 We sing songs for the wishing, of those who are kissing 
 But not for the missing 
 So this one's for all the lost children 
 This one's for all the lost children 
 This one's for all the lost children, wishing them well 
 And wishing them home 
 When you sit there addressing, counting your blessings 
 Biding your time 
 When you lay me down sleeping and my heart is weeping 
 Because I'm keeping a place 
 For all the lost children 
 This is for all the lost children 
 This one's for all the lost children, wishing them well 
 And wishing them home 
 Home with their fathers, 
 Snug close and warm, loving their mothers 
 I see the door simply wide open 
 But no one can find thee 
 So pray for all the lost children 
 Let's pray for all the lost children 
 Just think of all the lost children, wishing them well 
 This is for all the lost children 
 This one's for all the lost children 
 Just think of all the lost children 
 Wishing them well, and wishing them home"
245,Michael Jackson,pop,Love's Gone Bad (1995 Anthology Version),"Ah, I feel a fountain in my brain 
 Ice-cold water runnin' through my vein 
 Got a bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears 
 Heart's so sad 'cause love's gone bad 
 I see a rainbow going black 
 Must be a sign you ain't comin' back 
 Wake up at night, callin' your name 
 I see a face on my window pane 
 I've been this way since you've been gone 
 Without your love I can't go on 
 Look in the mirror, what do I see? 
 A cryin' face, kinda looks like me 
 Now where's the love you promised me? 
 Where's the tenderness to comfort me? 
 Every time some love I choose 
 I seem to always be the one to lose 
 Bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears 
 Heart's feeling sad 'cause love's gone bad 
 Love's gone bad, heart's feeling sad 
 Black crows flying up above 
 It's a sign I live my life without love 
 Slime's on the land, slime's on the sea 
 Slime's not the last thing I'm destined to be 
 In this whole world where there's nothing right 
 Since you've been gone I can't sleep at night 
 You said you'd be true to me 
 Instead you made a fool of me 
 Heart's feeling sad, love's gone bad 
 Love's gone bad, heart's feeling sad 
 Love's gone bad, heart's feeling sad 
 Love's gone bad, heart's feeling sad

 In war, 
 'Cause they rule the world 
 They're the 
 Men in black 
 Deciders of our fate 
 Men in black 
 The doorkeepers of reality 
 Men in black! 
 Don't try to hurt me, 'cause I'm armed 
 And I'm hungry for life, I wanna be one of you 
 The guys walking down the street 
 Time bends as they move 
 All are paralyzed when look at you 
 'Cause you're the 
 Men in black 
 Deciders of our fate 
 Men in black 
 The doorkeepers of reality 
 Men in black! 
 Men in black 
 Deciders of our fate

 Pointing guns, against the sun 
 Day night it's the fight for your life 
 It's like a human jungle 
 Tigers and all 
 Cause all you really need to fear is the 
 Strongest ones of all! 
 Men in black 
 Deciders of our fate

247,Michael Jackson,pop,Never Can Say Goodbye (The Neptunes Remix),"Never can say goodbye 
 No, no, no, no 
 Never can say goodbye 
 Even though the pain and heartache 
 Seems to follow me wherever I go 
 Though I try and try to hide my feelings 
 They always seem to show 
 Then you try to say you're leaving me 
 And I always have to say no 
 Tell me why is it so? 
 That I never can say goodbye 
 No, no, no, no 
 Never can say goodbye 
 Every time I think I've had enough 
 I start heading for the door 
 There's a very strange vibration 
 That passes me right through the core 
 It says turn around, you fool 
 You know you'll love her more and more 
 Tell me why is it so? 
 Don't wanna let you go 
 I never can say goodbye, girl 
 Ooh, ooh, baby 
 I never can say goodbye 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, ooh 
 Oh, I never can say goodbye, girl 
 Ooh, ooh, I never can say goodbye 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, ooh 
 Never can say goodbye 
 No, no, no, no 
 Never can say goodbye 
 I keep thinkin' that our problems 
 Soon are all gonna work out 
 But there's that same unhappy feeling 
 And there's that anguish, there's that doubt 
 It's that same old, did you hang up? 
 Can't do with you all the time 
 Tell me why is it so? 
 Don't wanna let you go 
 I never can say goodbye, girl 
 Ooh, ooh, baby, I never can say goodbye 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, ooh 
 Oh, I never can say goodbye, girl 
 Ooh, I never can say goodbye

 They want more money but the board won't pay 
 People 
 Everybody's talkin' 'bout ecology 
 The air's so polluted that it's hard to breathe 
 People 
 But that's what makes the world go round 
 The ups and downs a carousel 
 Changing people's heads around 
 Go underground young men 
 People make the world go round 
 Old folks judge you by the clothes you wear 
 They'd swear you're a Hippy if you have long hair 
 Young politicians fight for poverty 
 While people still cry for equality"
250,Michael Jackson,pop,Price Of Fame,"I took my baby on a river boat cruise 
 And she was well aware 
 I was excited about the way things could have been 
 Cause in it I don't care 
 I want a face no one can recognize, in disguise 
 Someone called out my name 
 They thought of taking pictures, autographs, then they grab 
 My joy has turned to pain 
 Father always told me 
 You won't live a quiet life 
 If you're reaching for fortune and fame 
 I feel the pressure setting in, I'm living just to win 
 I'm down in my pain, don't you feel it? 
 It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame 
 So don't be feelin' no pain! 
 It's the price of fame, it's the price of fame 
 So don't you ever complain! 
 I'm on, the cover of the magazine, what a scene 
 They know my every do's 
 ""Just sign your name on the dotted line, you'll be fine"" ? 
 That always bothers me 
 Get in your car, you wanna take a ride, look behind 
 Someone is following you 
 You try to get away you turn real fast, but too bad 
 They know your every move! 
 My father always told me 
 You won't live a quiet life 
 If you're reaching for fortune and fame 
 I feel the pressure setting in, I'm living just to win 
 I bleed all this pain, don't you ever complain! 
 It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame 
 So don't you ever complain! 
 It's the price of fame, you pay the price for fame 
 So don't be feelin' no pain! 
 It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame! 
 Father never lies, my father never lies 
 My father never lies 
 So don't be feelin' this way boy! 
 I'd like to take some time and get away, then they'll say 
 Is that boy still alive? 
 The week in village what a thrill 
 Only the strong survive 
 My father always told me 
 You won't live a quiet life 
 They startin' to wonderin' where have you been? 
 I feel their envious looks at me 
 Their mistaken jealousy 
 Then stand here in my shoes 
 And then get a taste of my blues! 
 It's the price of fame 
 You pay the price of fame, so don't you ever complain! 
 It's the price of fame 
 You pay the price of fame 
 So don't be feelin' this way! 
 It's the price of fame 
 You pay the price of fame, so don't you ever complain! 
 It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame! 
 Father never lies, my father never lies baby 
 My father never lies 
 So don't be feelin' no pain boy!"

 'Light coming from your eyes 
 Are you with me 
 Am I here with you 
 Are we in paradise 
 Tell me I'm not dreamin' 
 I know I've been here before 
 You go, then you come back for more 
 It's a mystery how you disappear 
 Like a shadow in the night 
 Tell me I'm not dreamin' 
 Are you too good to be true 
 Tell me I'm not dreamin' 
 Are you too good to be true 
 Tell me I'm not dreamin' 
 Midnight images of you 
 You slipped, slipped into my room 
 Could be magic, could be fantasy 
 Could it be that we're in love 
 Tell me I'm not dreamin' 
 Your voice whispers in the dark 
 You talk, talking to my heart 
 Are you with me 
 Am I here with you 
 Are we in paradise 
 Tell me I'm not dreamin' 
 When the morning comes 
 Wake me with your love 
 Let me know that I'm not dreamin' 
 Tell me this is real 
 Show me how you feel 
 Say it's what we both believe in"

 Snakes snails puppy dog tails 
 Sugar and spice and everything nice

 And you got a little gladness 
 Blue eyes cry 
 Two hearts say goodbye 
 And you got a little sadness

 Hearts say goodbye 
 Eyes start to cry 
 Heart on a tree 
 Walk by the sea 
 Snakes snails puppy dog tails 
 Sugar and spice everything nice 
 Yeah yeah all right 
 One more thing 
 You take a cruel word spoken 
 Pride gets broken 
 And you got a little break-up 
 You take a little bit of soul 
 Sweet words being told 
 And you got a little make-up 
 That's what love is made of 
 That's what love is made of 
 Words being told 
 With a little bit of soul 
 Pride gets broken

 They just went away and left it standing there 
 All alone on Christmas eve 
 I hear the Christmas bells

 The songs of good cheer that only brings me tears

 And say a little prayer

 And the bracelet, and chains

 Another chain on top of that 
 And another ring on another finger, and another grill 
 And then I switch grills and then I change chains 
 And that's all you see, but you know? 
 'Ey 
 I wake up early in the morning 
 Hit the snooze button for hours 
 Get up, hop into a two hundred thousand dollar shower 
 Brush my teeth when I'm out it 
 Remote start the Audi 
 Kiss my boy, kiss my girl, kiss my wife, and then I'm outtie 
 Damn 
 Grind time from a struggle to a hussle 
 ""Aw man""s to ""God damn""s 
 From a clam to a mussel 
 I ain't say you had it better 
 But damn, did I tussle 
 I ain't have much 
 But if you tried to take it, I'll bust ya 
 It feels like I done died 
 'Cause every time I drive my past life flash 
 Right in front of my eyes 
 'Cause I'm not one of them guys 
 That don't remember shit, 
 Can't even go home and drive alone in this whip 
 'Cause everybody want him gone 
 But you got me fucked up 
 If a nigga gon' be on YouTube saying' 
 I ain't from my bowin' homes [?] 
 So I'm gonna keep goin' strong 
 And let you niggas go out of season 
 As long as my kids is breathin' 
 I'm doing this for a lot of reason 
 I do it for my kids and they kids' kids 
 And when I'm dead they come to my grave 
 To tell me what they kids did, yeah 
 I'mma tell 'em my style and how long I has hated on about it 
 And how it took twenty minutes to make a song about it 
 Even though I was young I was actin' grown about it 
 Took some years, but eventually they left me 'lone about it 
 Old folks cheering' me on 'cause they know I got it 
 They see niggas get in the game and fold like origami 
 But the only foldin' I'm doin' is when I'm at shows poppin' 
 Got 'em fainting' like Michael Jackson, straight hos droppin' 
 Then I go home, safely homie, there's no robbin' 
 Gated community 
 You gotta know the code, partna 
 Walk up to the crib 
 Lamborghini look so proper 
 And six old-schools sittin' on 24"" choppas 
 White folks in my neighborhood think I'm the Dalai Lama 
 'Specially when I come outside like roo sticky dima [?] 
 But everything good gotta turn bad 
 It's like the weekly drama, 
 You know, lil' small shit, 
 Like girls saying' they my baby mama 
 But this music has made me calmer 
 I now understand karma 
 These niggas is mad, 
 They wanna assassinate me 
 Like Barack Obama 
 But I graduated, School of Hard Knocks, summa cum laude 
 On the side of the stage 
 Like I am really 'bout to fuck this crowd up 
 That makes me prouder, makes me a man 
 If you ain't doin' what I'm' doin' 
 You automatically a fan 
 Damn, get on your knees please 
 And praise God that he sent you somebody 
 That can just tell you niggas these things

 You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes 
 You're paralyzed 
 'Cause this is thriller, thriller night 
 And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike 
 You know it's thriller, thriller night 
 You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight 
 You hear the door slam and realize there's nowhere left to run 
 You feel the cold hand and wonder if you'll ever see the sun 
 You close your eyes and hope that this is just imagination, girl 
 But all the while, you hear the creature creeping up behind 
 You're out of time 
 'Cause this is thriller, thriller night 
 There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes, girl

 There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time

 This is the end of your life 
 They're out to get you, there's demons closing in on every side 
 They will possess you unless you change that number on your dial 
 Now is the time for you and I to cuddle close together, yeah 
 All through the night I'll save you from the terror on the screen 
 I'll make you see

 The midnight hour is close at hand 
 Creatures crawl in search of blood 
 To terrorize y'alls neighborhood 
 I'm gonna thrill ya tonight, ooh baby 
 I'm gonna thrill ya tonight, oh darlin' 
 Thriller night, baby, ooh! 
 The foulest stench is in the air 
 The funk of forty thousand years 
 And grizzly ghouls from every tomb 
 Are closing in to seal your doom 
 And though you fight to stay alive 
 Your body starts to shiver 
 For no mere mortal can resist 
 The evil of the thriller"

276,Michael Jackson,pop,You Are So Beautiful,"You are so beautiful, You make me shine 
 I feel so happy now, because of you... 
 You are my children and I love you 
 You make me speechless, what can I do... 
 You're so beautiful."
277,Michael Jackson,pop,You Don't Stand Another Chance,"You don't stand another chance 
 You don't stand another chance {You can't really stand it, baby} 
 You don't stand another chance 
 You don't stand another chance {Ooh} 
 You don't stand another chance 
 You don't stand another chance {You can't really stand it, baby} 
 You don't stand another chance 
 You don't stand another chance {Ooh} 
 {Ooh} 
 {Ooh} 
 Standin' at the edge of time 
 'Bout to lose my mind 
 'Cause you try to take him away from me 
 But I won't let it be 
 You just walk into my life 
 And try to take away my only prize 
 But you better get ready 
 'Cause his love is right here with me 
 You don't stand another chance 
 You don't stand another chance 
 You don't stand another chance 
 You don't stand another chance 
 He belongs to me 
 Just wait and see 
 I'll take him in my arms 
 He's in love, in love too much with me 
 Nothin' you can do or say 
 Could make him look your way 
 So you better get ready 
 'Cause he's gonna come walkin' my way 
 You don't stand another chance 
 You don't stand another chance {You can't really stand it, baby} 
 You don't stand another chance (You don't stand, baby) 
 You don't stand another chance {Ooh} 
 You don't stand another chance (Stand) 
 You don't stand another chance (You don't stand, baby) 
 You don't stand another chance (You don't stand) 
 You don't stand another chance (Another chance) 
 Sit and wait at home 
 But leave me alone 
 You'll be with him when he's up, not down 
 Until the mornin' ground 
 Let me tell you somethin', it's true 
 He's not in love with you 
 So you better get ready 
 'Cause there's nothin' comin' down your way 
 You don't stand another chance 
 You don't stand another chance {You don't stand it} 
 You don't stand another chance (You don't stand) 
 You don't stand another chance (Another chance) 
 You don't stand another chance (Another chance) 
 You don't stand another chance (You don't stand, baby) 
 You don't stand another chance {Ooh} (Baby)

 You don't stand 
 You don't stand {Ooh} (You don't stand) 
 Well, you know 
 Somebody's gotta lose 
 We all can't win (Another chance) 
 Maybe next time {Ooh} 
 You don't stand another chance 
 You don't stand another chance {You can't really stand it, baby} (You don't stand, baby) 
 You don't stand another chance 
 You don't stand another chance (Another chance)

278,Michael Jackson,pop,You Haven't Done Nothin',"We are amazed but not amused 
 By all the things you say that you'll do 
 Though much concerned but not involved 
 With decisions that are made by you 
 But we are sick and tired of hearing your song 
 Telling how you are gonna change right from wrong 
 'Cause if you really want to hear our views 
 ""You haven't done nothin'""! 
 It's not too cool to be ridiculed 
 But you brought this upon yourself 
 The world is tired of pacifiers 
 We want the truth and nothin' else 
 And we are sick and tired of hearing your song 
 Telling how you are gonna change right from wrong 
 'Cause if you really want to hear our views 
 ""You haven't done nothin'""! 
 (Jackson 5 join along with me say) 
 Doo doo wop - hey hey hey 
 Doo doo wop - whoa whoa whoa 
 Doo doo wop - co co co 
 Doo doo wop - na na na 
 Doo doo wop - bum bum bum 
 Doo doo wop 
 We would not care to wake up to the nightmare 
 That's becoming real life 
 But when mislead who knows a person's mind 
 Can turn as cold as ice 
 Why do you keep on making us hear your song 
 Telling us how you are changing right from wrong 
 'Cause if you really want to hear our views 
 ""You haven't done nothin'""! 
 Yeah 
 (Jackson 5 sing along again say) 
 Doo doo wop 
 Doo doo wop - oh 
 Doo doo wop - co co co 
 Doo doo wop - sing it baby 
 Doo doo wop - bum bum bum 
 Doo doo wop - um 
 Sing it loud for your people say 
 Doo doo wop - um um um 
 Doo doo wop - stand up be counted, say 
 Doo doo wop - co co co 
 Doo doo wop - ow 
 Doo doo wop - bum bum bum 
 Doo doo waaaah..."
