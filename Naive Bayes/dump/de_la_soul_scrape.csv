 Access to her code 
 Lovestruck was my mode 
 Took a look, dropped my textbook 
 Jenifa... (OH!) 
 Breakfast, broke it fast 
 She was in my English class 
 Asked for notes, rocked my boat 
 Jenifa... (OH!) 
 Jenny 
 Lost her favourite penny 
 So I gave her a dollar 
 She kissed me 
 (And I hollered) 
 In a flash the school bell rang 
 Jenny grabbed on to my hand 
 Took me home and said, Trugoy just 
 Swing and swing and swing 
 POS: 
 The downstairs, where we met 
 I brought records, she cassettes 
 Lost the breaks, found her shape 
 Jenifa, oh Jenny 
 Transcripts showed more than flirt 
 'I love daisies' read her shirt 
 Grabbed my jeans, Jimmy screamed 
 Jenifa, oh Jenny 
 Marvelous 
 Shaped like a vase 
 No one can live their life for Pos 
 Found a house, aroused my joust 
 Jenifa, oh Jenny 
 Her clothes, I did shuck 
 Just like Dan I strictly stuck 
 To the punt, she cried 'kick it' 
 Posdnuos was in 
 Jenny 
 Only thought about Jimmy 
 But asked was I a virgin 
 Like some kid named Derwin? 
 She said 'Let's try it in the bathroom' 
 But 'Dnuos is way above sinks 
 So to the kitchen she did Dan 
 And came back wrapped in Saran 
 (Now wait a minute! Little Derwin got something to 
 Show us that Jenny could never do. Listen...) 
 (Hey. Look at little Derwin. Look at him go, look at him go! 
 Awww, baby.)

 Jenny 
 Teased my homeboy Granny 
 In fact she teased so many 
 She was known as a garden tool

 No more 
 I dispatched 
 Was it Jimmy had met his match 
 Or could it be the realisation 
 All girls owned a Jenny 
 For normal health 
 I had fought 
 A valuable lesson she had taught

 On, see I don't ask for maximum security 
 But my dwellin' is swellin' 
 It nipped my bud when I happened to fall 
 Into a spot Where no ink or an ink-blot 
 Was on a scroll I just wrote me a new 'mot' 
 But now it's gone There's no Suckers knew that I hate 
 To recognise that every time I'm writin' It's gone

 On my well-guarded spreadsheets 
 Oh why, hell does it send up fleets 
 Of evil-doers through the big hole 
 To get to evil-doers who dig holes 
 Which leaves my lawn with lawn-chew 
 I think I'd better plant traces to give clues 
 Or better yet call 911 
 And when they get here I inform them I'm the Plug One

 That's the Magic Number 
 Yes it is 
 It's the magic number 
 Somewhere in this hip hop soul community 
 Was born 3 Mase Dove and me 
 And that's the magic number 
 (What does it all mean?) 
 Difficult preaching is Posdnuos' pleasure 
 Pleasure and preaching starts in the heart 
 Something that stimulates the music in my measure 
 Measure in my music raised in three parts 
 Casually see but don't do like the Soul 
 'Cause seein' and doin' are actions for monkeys 
 Doin' hip hop hustle, no rock and roll 
 Unless your name's Brewster, 'cause Brewsters are funky 
 Parents let go 'cause there's magic in the air 
 Criticising rap shows you're out of order 
 Stop look and listen to the phrase Fred Astaires 
 And don't get offended while Mase do-se-do's your daughter 
 A tri-camera rolls since our music's now set 
 Fly rhymes are stored on a D.A.I.S.Y. production 
 It stands for ""Da Inner Sound Y'all"" and y'all can bet 
 That the action's not a trick, but showing the function 
 Everybody wants to be a deejay 
 Everybody wants to be an emcee 
 But being speakers are the best 
 And you don't have to guess 
 De La Soul posse consists of three 
 And that's the magic number 
 DOVE 
 This here piece of the pie 
 Is not desser but the course that we dine 
 And three out of every darn time 
 The effect is ""Mmmm"" when a daisy grows in your mind 
 Showing true position, this here piece is 
 Kissin' the part of the pie that's missin' 
 When that negative number 
 Fills up the cavity 
 Maybe you can subtract it 
 You can call it your lucky partner 
 Maybe you can call it 
 Your adjective 
 But odd as it may be 
 Without my 1 and 2 where would there be 
 My 3 Mase Pos and Me 
 And that's the Magic Number 
 Focus is formed by flaunts to the soul 
 Souls who flaunt styles gain praises by pounds 
 Common are speakers who are never scrolls 
 Scrolls written daily creates a new sound 
 Listeners listen 'cause this here is wisdom 
 Wisdom of a Speaker, a Dove and a Plug 
 Set aside a legal substance to feed 'em 
 For now get 'em high off this dialect drug 
 Time is a factor so it's time that counts 
 Count not the negative actions of one 
 Speakers of soul say it's time to shout 
 Three forms the soul to a positive sum 
 Dance to this fix and flex every muscle 
 Space can be filled if you rise like my lumber 
 Advance to the tune but don't do the hustle 
 Shake, rattle, roll to my Magic Number 
 Now you may try to subtract it 
 But it just won't go away 
 Three times one? 
 (What is it?) (One, two, three!) 
 And that's a Magic Number 
 (Yo, what's up?) 
 (1, 2, 3) 
 (I say, children, what does it all mean?) 
 (Whoa-whoa-wo, 1, 2, 3) 
 (I wouldn't lie to you)

 (No more no less)

 Bang-oh-bang until you burn your shoe soles

 Live is the motion of the soul step 
 Set the exposure to my one step 
 This scene'll last to the next step 
 All those in favor take a big step 
 True to the Soul, we'll never back step 
 In sense to that, we don't half step 
 Just as a reminder from the last step 
 Negative ones are lost in footsteps 
 Levels we've set will never go down 
 Competitions commence the step down 
 Those involved with peace who know the Soul's down 
 Can see that the Soul has got a new sound 
 Dance until you find yourself a new part 
 If you don't then I'll give you the True part 
 When received you'll see the real small part 
 Of the new way is no part at all 
 POS: 
 Pos and Dove is rarely caught not dressed in peace 
 Movements always walking round now stressing peace 
 When this biter should know true in peace 
 Instead they cause violence and shoot out beef

 And if you crave sex, drugs and rock'n'roll

 Now she's only fourteen, what a start 
 But this effect is ground common in these parts

 And dreams are often torn and shattered and hard to stitch 
 Negative's the attitude that runs the show

 Which is the one to blame when bullets blow 
 Either Peter, Jane, or John or Joe

 The future plays no matter, just the present flow 
 When the greeting place is the G-H-E-T-T-O 
 DOVE: 
 Lies are pointed strong into your skull 
 Deep within your brain against the wall 
 To hide or just erase the glowing note 
 Of how to use the ghetto as a scapegoat 
 Truth from Trugoy's mouth is here to scar 
 Those who blame the G for all bizarre 
 So open up your vents and record well 
 For this is where we stand, for the True tell 
 Ghetto gained a ghetto name from ghetto ways 
 Now there could be some ghetto gangs and ghetto play 
 If ghetto thang can have its way in ghetto range 
 Then there must be some ghetto love and ghetto change 
 Though confident they keep it kept, we know for fact 
 They lie like ghettos form, 'cause people lack 
 To see that they must all get out the ghetto hold 
 The truth they never told, 'cause it's just the ghetto thang 
 It's just the ghetto thang (word) 
 POS: 
 Do people really wish when they blow 
 Out the cake candles, and if so 
 Is it for the sunken truth which could arise 
 From out the characters in which the ghetto hides 
 Roses in the ring supply their shown relief 
 Granted it's planted by their shown belief 
 Kill and feed off your own brother man 
 Has quickly been adopted as the master plan 
 Posses of our people has yet to provoke 
 Freedom or death to them, it's just a joke 
 What causes this defect, I don't know 
 Maybe it's the G-H-E-T-T-O 
 It's just the ghetto thang (word) 
 Standing in the rain is nothing felt 
 When problems hold more value, but never dealt 
 With buildings crumbling to the ground 
 Impact noise is silent sound 
 But who's the one to say this life is wrong 
 When ghetto life is chosen strong 
 We seem to be misled about our dreams 
 But dreams ain't what it seem when it's just the ghetto thang 
 It's just the ghetto thang (word)"

 Involvements before the sun 
 But clear your court 'cause this is a one-man sport

 'Cause they've already been squooshed 
 Freeze a frame about moods the same

 The chosen one to speak 
 Let me lay my hand across yours 
 And aim a kiss upon your cheek

 May it be filled with the pleasure principle 
 In circumference to my voice 
 About those other Jennys I reckoned with 
 Lost them all like a homework excuse 
 This time the Magic Number is two

 Squeeze your stoop like Betty Boop 
 We'll make Campbell Alphabet Soup 
 And spell Plug One's within 
 Forward march is the say when transistors will play 
 Come into bed is the mood 
 Dolby sound will be then top crowned 
 When I put the needle into your groove

 I show this in gifts, words or letters 
 But even without those three 
 Eye know you'll be close to me

 Then we can meet Mr. Stuckie, and Pos' brother Lucky 
 Will preach, let the wedding begin 
 Shot by an arrow of Cupid through the string of a G-clef 
 My dear, I claim you're def 
 And if you can hear me, by golly gee 
 Trugoy is ready for what you possess

 And on Mars where we could be all alone

 What it was was more then plug-up dosage more than DAISY age 
 Conversation drew a rule, which the crowd will roar by millions 
 Mr. Crocodile said, 'Dove, you must look for now the villains 
 Try to hold you underwater, but one thing we all must heed 
 Sony Walkmans keep us walking, De La Soul can help you breathe 
 When you tread water' 
 As I walked along my journey, I thought 'What have I just learned?' 
 In a flash I saw commotion there was movement in these ferns 
 Silently the silence came, was it the end of my world? 
 I shouted out in fear, 'Who's there?' 'It's me,' said Mr. Squirrel 
 'I've searched for you all over, now you're found, no time to waste. 
 We must find the Preacher Man, we must find the P.A. Mase. 
 All my population's dying, and we're all in tune to doom.

 How do you do? As for me, I'm in tip-top shape today, 
 Cause my water's clean and no one's menu says Fresh Fish Filet 
 See I look past all my worries, which is something you must do 
 Though you're fed up, throw your head up 
 With this advice from me to you 
 And that's to tread water' 
 As my day went unexplained, time was finding nothing fun 
 As I walked along the sidewalk, I heard, 'Psst, excuse me, Plug One.' 
 From my Soul, De La that is, I hollered 'Yes, are you talking to me?' 
 'No alarm meant,' he said, 'Let me introduce myself. I'm Mr Monkey.' 
 'Mr Monkey, I pledge you slap of five, now how does your problem meet?' 
 He said, 'My bananas are at their ripest, but they all stand at three feet. 
 My swinging hand is bandaged up. Could you help me with this chore?' 
 I brought him down to the Native shop and bought him copies of the De La score 
 Which assisted well in his elevation, now all bananas is at his grasp 
 He decided with this accomplished, He would put me on to the path

 Perogative praised positively I'm acquitted 
 Enemies publicly shame my utility 
 After the battle they admit that I'm with it 
 Simply soothe, will move vinyl like glue 
 Transistors are never more shown with like 
 When vocal flow brings it all down in ruin 
 Due to a clue of a naughty noise called 
 Plug Tunin' 
 (Hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmmmm) 
 Flock to the preacher called Pos 
 Let him be the stir to the style of your stew 
 Sit while the kid of the Plug form aroma 
 Then grab a Daisy to sip your favorite brew 
 Lettin' this soul fire be your first prior, 
 But don't let the kick drum stub your big toe 
 See that the three will be your thread 
 But like my man Chuck D said, 'What a brother know' 
 Dance while I play and the cue cards sway 
 From my flower girls China and Jette 
 The button is pressed in '89 we'll start the panic 
 From De La Soul and a Prince from Stet 
 Negative noise will be all divided 
 Dangerous to dance, Posdnuos will croon 
 Ducks and kizids will all be rid

 Brothers of the Soul who present a new flick 
 Every last viewer is tuned to the method, 
 Known to be a method, no magicians, not a trick 
 Bitten by the spoken who been titled Plug Two 
 Swallowed by the loonies who are jealous with the showbiz 
 Dove'll teach the truth, Posdnuos will preach the youth 
 To the fact that this will bring an end to the negative 
 Flow to the sway 'cause I say fa-so-la-ti 
 At the top we will dwell 
 Difference is fame and we rise then we build 
 Where we are set we get fat and we swell 
 Motions of the Soul is a positive stride 
 One step forward is the space we consume 
 Vivid as the moon, you have yet to assume 
 How the Soul found the motto of a naughty noise called 
 Plug Tunin' 
 Vocal is local so believe that 
 This chant shan't rely on the strong lap 
 Trying and live so you best realise 
 That the gift that I present, I say gift wrap 
 Style of the Tune is personal 
 And defining what's the rhyme is worst of all 
 Stop, sit and study 'cause the meaning isn't muddy 
 Just preach and do the gear as the first of all 
 Watch while the pitcher is pitching 
 'Cause this is the pitch of the year 
 Sing a simple song but keep the swing strong 
 Though you heard Dove crying 'I ain't fair' 
 Those who think De La's on the flip tip 
 Try to flip this and you're doomed 
 Watch for the B-B 'cause if you try to grieve me 
 You'll be hung by the wire of the Plug Tune

 Giving something sheer for the crowd is our major

 No time to rest, we got work in the studio 
 Studio suppliers rest at no time 
 Show time is enough when the Soul is performing 
 Performing is the Soul y'all and it's show time 
 Coping with dates in clubs, can't even lounge 
 Lounge with the homeboys how we are copin' 
 Scoping new material for Paul to plug high-pitched 
 High-pitched what Paul plugs in and still scopin' 
 Bearer of beautiful views to express the peace 
 Peaceful expressions why we are bearers 
 What the Soul tries to project is when existing in rap 
 You're living in a full time era

 Fear so much of what Pos is puttin'

 This field to me is filed, there's no joke 
 So soak up the fact there's no part-time

 Dove comes to peace like stand comes to sit 
 Stand for the court 'cause standing is healthy 
 Healthy in sense is mentally fit

 Just here to do the same with no trick 
 Grab the Plug Two's live wire, my brother 
 And find that you've grabbed my pet boa constrict 
 Ring goes the garbage, I'm hearing 
 Seek for the truth, my brother is tearing 
 No time to back-step 'cause if you back-step 
 Look what you stepped in, you stepped in mess 
 So look what's around you 
 Don't worry for the Soul will find the truth 
 About three years from now, you know why?

 A moo moo moo, a jumping jack 
 Rock this is brain now I'm one step over 
 Respect your parents, they're pushovers 
 Chasing my fun like the IRS 
 My girl's too young to have big breasts 
 For a good time we chill by the mall 
 I tell her tales, some small some tall 
 Why, how you got peanuts, pecans, 
 I wipe her cheek, she grabs my hand 
 I have a curfew, she says to me 
 I'll take you home, look hon, you'll see 
 The deed was done and I thought to myself 
 Jeff, you're the mack and no one else 
 (Jeff, I told you, my name is Jeff) 
 The astronomical wiz, dazzler of the showbiz 
 Kids of the new biz for you 
 Don't try to solve it, just involve yourself 
 In this deadly De La dialogue 
 Yo, I smell black fog 
 POS: 
 That's right, me and Mase blew it to clear your ass straight out of this 
 Sector. This is De La Soul 
 Wax! 
 MASE: 
 So wait until your own piece of wax come out! 
 Lucky: 
 Yo, is this true? Is Jeff really coming out with his own song? And if he 
 Do, will he have the 
 Decency to 
 Change his name to a suitable public speaker? Yo, I don't know, but 
 Bring in that funky 
 Astronomical piano 
 For this is the take-off man Luck signing off."

 You get 'em from my sister, you get 'em from my bro 
 All I is is man, and once an embryo 
 Am I solid gold, I don't cast a glow 
 Yes, I guess it's reflex, some have no control 
 I'd rather let a laughter, and tally off I go 
 Canoeing up the river or out into the O 
 You just know we're not, so not play the role 
 Some are lovey-dovey, ah you crazy crow 
 Some shake your hand but (this is called The Show) 
 I was John Doe, now I'm Mr. Jolicoeur 
 Pissed with the witness, and now I adore 
 O's got the world cause O's was on tour 
 Girls gave the O's and guys, oh for sure 
 Where they arose from, nobody knows 
 What do they mean, well here's how it goes 
 Oh shoot's got the O's when you hold the dough 
 You know who you are, but they didn't know 
 And now with respect they flex like a pro 
 You're first another nigger, but now an Afro 
 Oodles and oodles of O's and 
 Oodles and oodles and oodles of O's, ya know 
 They givin' oodles of O's and O's 
 And oodles and oodles and oodles of O's, ya know 
 They givin' oodles of O's and O's 
 And oodles and oodles and oodles of (oh) 
 Last of the fast Plug pipers at the door 
 In your eye, burning like rubbing alcohol 
 Native is the Tongue that speaks the Guacomo 
 Kinfolk will play this in stere-ere-o 
 Chanters play the part of a herd at a show 
 Pos prints the peace on his jeans or Girbauds 
 But let the herd know if beef they wanna throw 
 Lunches of punches is what I bestow 
 Oodles of O's enhance my ""ho""s in mic checks 
 O's take the shape of medallions and specs 
 Don't forget the 'oles that let the air in my nose 
 Breathe in the fresh as the stale hit the road 
 Girls ask for flicks and I'll plot the pose 
 Eat the Al Greens, won't sniff the Kurt Blows 
 Mase got something to say and it goes 
 (Maceo is rocking on the radio)

 Hoods like to play macho, ya know 
 Guns going ""Bo,"" people hit the floor 
 Don't have a piece, but an arrow and bow 
 Target it firm 'cause I'm head Comancho 
 Charging barricades like a raging rhino 
 The donuts come big and some in jumbo 
 The landlord is finished, but before I go 
 I give a shout out to Quest and my fellow Jungle Bros 
 Knocked by the dock of the bay by the shore 
 Swimming in the rhythm of the hi-de-hi-de-ho 
 Punk Pinocchio's, gotta go, gotta go 
 (What's the reason) To be cheerful 
 Season is breeze, time to pimp promo 
 Nuts can no flow if the shade is in the dough 
 On with me hat, d-d-duh-duh-doh 
 Dreadlock is heading out the door, y'all 
 We're selling O's, y'all 
 We're selling O's and O's 
 We're selling O's at the corner store, y'all

 POS: Look, I do everything I can to treat you like a rose. 
 TESHA: Yeah but you even give better treatment to that girl 
 Named Selina from uptown like a Daisy. 
 You even gave her some of your special donuts for free. 
 POS: So this is what this is all about, huh? Donuts. 
 TESHA: No, Pos, can't you hear the music, it's all about Hey Love 
 POS: I don't understand why you're dissing me, it's not like I'm Paul, 
 I don't have two kids in every state. 
 TESHA: But you probably got two girls in every state. 
 If you're not going to go about it the way I want you to,

 Consists, consists, consists of Jungle, Quest and others 
 Get played, get played, played a lot on radio 
 And also, and also, and also by some foul brothers 
 The Pease, the Pease the Pease Porridge never failed 
 It kept, it kept us calm, our stylin' merry 
 But late, but lately loonies acting real bold 
 Can't sip in luxury my apple cranberry 
 Girls watch, and watch, and watch I dance the big tut 
 Our home, our home our homeboys has to plan tricks 
 Don't real, don't real, don't realise the Native Tongue 
 Is rollin' strong and we're startin' in the megamix

 Yo, they was on the dance floor, right, some kid stepped up to them 
 And said something about hippies, then punks, and the chubby one, Plug Three? 
 - Yeah. Plug Three, yeah I know him.

 Think he didn't when he did, and then them other kids the Jungle Brothers and Quest and, 
 Um, what's the other ones, the other ones? 
 - The Violators. 
 - The Violators, right, right, throwing chairs, 
 And they didn't care who they was hitting, you think they wasn't? 
 - Yeah. I know, I thought it was supposed to be about peace signs, things like that, you know... 
 MASE: 
 Question, and that's if only I can ask this question

 Yeah, but my tolerance level has now peaked 
 And now it's time for some heads to get flown 
 DOVE: 
 We bring, we bring, we bring, we bring the peace of course 
 But pack a nine inside, inside my De La drawers 
 A picture, picture, picture, picture painted pink 
 Could turn to red, to red, to red in blooded quick 
 But in a single file my Native Tongue is calm 
 I rather, rather pass a brother palm to palm 
 I kick, I kick, I kick a verse of unity 
 And shack, and shackle steps to the beat, beat 
 I click, I click the TV to the Simpsons 
 And sip the Porridge deep into my system 
 So mel, so mellow mode is my day mode 
 Inside the studio or on a road 
 The Swing, the Swingalow is the now step 
 It's murder if you bet 'cause you're life's jep 
 To praise, to praise the Soul is on a down drag 
 It's false, because I'll spray you with the Black Flag

 Hey D, hey D, hey DJ set the record up 
 It's time, it's time, it's time to tame the annoying pups 
 Throw on the Touching Fingers serenade 
 So we can throw our lemonade 
 In their face and kick their little butts 
 FIGHT COMMENTATORS: (Squirrel and Mikey Roads) 
 - And off, and Mase is the first to throw a punch 
 And he connects lovely to the ribcage. Wouldn't you say so Squirrel? 
 - Indeed, indeed, I waould say he showed a lot of formulate combination, 
 But look at the hoodlum trying to escape.

 We won't, we won't eat until the heads are flown 
 Take advantage to a cool one's peaceful ways 
 But when, but when we fly that head all the people say 
 THE FROG: (Lisle Leete) 
 Here in Frogland, we always eat our Porridge, 'cause it keeps us frogs real peaceful like. 
 JABIB: (Jarobi) 
 In my land, my people adore Porridge. 
 And I don't understand why De La Soul is so violent, and we are so peaceful, 
 We sit by the camp fire and listen to our rituals, and they are so violent. I don't understand, 
 I don't understand.

 Well it was a Wednesday 
 Me and Boss Hog was kinda hungry 
 Like two eggs, and a slop beef slice of lettuce 
 And a glass of milk and some cookies. 
 Spotted in the mist was a BK logo 
 What we said - well what do you know 
 This chick thought I was trying to play fly 
 'Cause I had a pair of blue jeans on. 
 Young girl, won't you take my order? 
 She said, ""Yeah, but right now I'm kinda busy... 
 Can't you see I'm trying to put this band aid on my finger?"" 
 Lingering, I could tell 
 She's a B-K mademoiselle 
 Ripped uniform and bottom bell 
 And some Jelly stuff on her sleeve 
 Look to this 'cause I had no name tag on my collar 
 Could be pissed 'cause she's clocking 2.45 an hour 
 And then Boss Hog hollar 
 ""Girl you better make this quick!"" 
 She said, ""I ain't your girl and I ain't your chick!"" 
 I had an idea and lickity split 
 Took my hat off and that was it 
 Dread locks fallen all over me and then I said 
 ""Yeah now we'll see!"" 
 And o' with quick velocity honey was mesmerized 
 ""Ain't you that guy?"" 
 ""Ain't you that GIRL!"" 
 ""De La Soul, right?"" 
 ""No Tracy Chapman!"" 
 ""Why don't you come over to the counter; and write me out an 
 Autograph?"" 
 Ha ha ha, I had to laugh 
 She was quick with the Bic just to get that autograph 
 But me and Hogg just laughed, and laughed 
 ""What's the name of that song you sing?"" 
 ""Living in a fast car,"" I said 
 Forget about the order I made 
 I'll go get a slice of pizza instead.

 Of your polyester pants and their o' so high waters 
 Look at what you do all day but take orders 
 You bow tie wearing, clocking and staring 
 I know your just upset because you can't get the rat/wrap 
 I think you Chubby for my man is living slack 
 P2 - Yeah, I know your man, the biggest punk in school 
 Selling devil rock to the fiends and the fools! 
 With one hand that punk I could snap- the kid is so skinny... 
 F - But we be livin' fat 
 P2 - Speaking of fat, would you like a diet soda? 
 Cause less fat on you would spare us all the odor 
 Better yet pour it down the pants and let the acid kill 
 The smell that should have been left to Masingel! 
 Let me make you a deal, take the soda free and jet 
 I got to much family to heed your threats 
 F - Are you a family man? (Word booty!) 
 Well I shouldn't be surprised 
 Your sister's flipping burgers and your momma's frying fries 
 P2 - Don't even try that shit! 
 F - Oh damn look! (What?) 
 F - Here comes one more 
 It's your father he just finished mooping the floor 
 Now give them a hand, it's the BK clan 
 So you can't talk garbage about who I am 
 P2 - well, arn't we living foul 
 Speaking of foul how bout some chicken for the cow? 
 Ops I meant you sorry for the mix up 
 But your stomachs always big from the sexual slip ups! 
 F - I could buy you and sell you for pennies, young man! 
 {You'd better!} 
 I think there's something you should understand 
 I try to be nice and help the poor make money 
 And since I know you need it, I'll go elsewhere dummy! 
 Now B-K workers is too damn rude 
 I think I'll go get me some Chinese food"

 In '83, gee, yo 
 And spray the sheen so I get a Soul Glow 
 I play the corner tough 
 And me and Mase pull puffs on a blunt

 Givin' high-five is what I want 
 So I puff a blunt, I don't front

 But I flex more strength when I'm asleep

 Make her dry her face, buy her gold earlocks 
 But I may, she flocks round me like a donut 
 She got sprinkles but I bite my way out 
 More brothers come about, try to scheme slick 
 But the Native Tongue's thick 
 Lick 'em real good, like a real hood should 
 But the fly tape let the car speakers shake 
 I ran a cop down, I smile a frown with a but 
 Show gold teeth, 'cause I ain't a vegetarian 
 Not scared of beef, sport a feather like Chief

 Keeps his kids hooray, a size nine and half

 With the quickness I bust the true slang 
 Show no pit to those who don't understand

 I busted loose but now the blue goose is on my tail

 My jeans are brand new, with twelve more 
 In the closet with my silk, and below 
 My 45 pack thick, draw quick 
 If a nigga starts some shibidibidit 
 My crib is uptown, downtown, L.I. 
 And another crib in Queens 
 I munch some cornbread, Boar's Head 
 My favorite porck chops and 
 A plate of collar greens 
 I chill with Shymel, Akeem, Jaheed 
 And the Rastafarians'll be the crown in 
 And the Poppa

41,De La Soul,hiphop,Millie Pulled A Pistol On Santa,"""If you will suck my soul 
 I will lick your funky emotions"" 
 This is the stylin' for a title that sounds silly 
 But nothin' silly 'bout the triflin' times of Millie 
 Millie, a Brooklyn Queen-originally from Philly 
 Complete with an accent that made her sound hill-billy 
 Around this time, the slammin' joint was Milk is Chilin' 
 But even cooler was my social worker Dillon 
 Yeah, I had a social worker 'cause I had some troubles 
 Anyone who'd riff on me, I'd pop their dome like bubbles 
 He'd bring me to his crib to watch my favorite races 
 That's how his daughter Millie became one of my favorite faces 
 She had the curves that make you wanna take chances 
 I mean on her, man, I'd love to make advances 
 I guess her father must 'a got the same feelin' 
 I mean, actually findin' his own daughter Millie appealing 
 At the time no one knew but it was a shame 
 That Millie became a victim of the touchy-touchy game 
 Yo Millie, what's the problem, lately you've been buggin' 
 On your dukie earrings, someone must be tuggin' 
 You were a dancer who could always be found clubbin' 
 Now you're world renowned with the frown you're luggin' 
 Come to think your face look stink when Dill's around you 
 He's your father-what done happen-did he ground you? 
 You shouldn't flip on him 'cause Dill is really cool 
 Matter of fact, the coolest elder in the school 
 He hooked up a trip to bring us all the Lacey 
 He volunteered to play old Santa Claus at Macy's 
 Child, ya got the best of pops anyone could have 
 Dillon's cool, super hip, you should be glad 
 Yeah, it seemed that Santa's ways were parallel with Dillon 
 But when Millie and him got him, he was more of a villain 
 While she slept in he crept inside her bedroom 
 And he would toss and then would force her to give him head room 
 Millie tried real hard to let this hell not happen 
 But when she'd fuss, he would just commence to slappin' 
 (Yo Dillon man, Millie's been out of school for a week, man, what's the 
 Deal?) 
 I guess he was givin' Millie's bruises time to heal 
 Of course he told us she was sick and we believed him 
 And at the department store as Santa we would see him 
 And as he smiled, his own child was at home plottin' 
 How off the face of this earth she was gonna knock him 
 When I got home, I found she had tried to call me 
 My machine had kicked to her hey how ya doin' (s-s-s-sorry) 
 I tried to call the honey but her line was busy 
 I guess I'll head to Macy's and bug out on Dillon 
 I received a call from Misses Sick herself 
 I asked her how was she recoverin' her health 
 She said that what she had to ask would make it seem minute 
 She wanted to talk serious, I said, ""go ahead-shoot"" 
 She claimed I hit the combo dead upon the missal 
 Wanted to know if I could get a loaded pistol 
 That ain't a problem but why would Millie need one 
 She said she wanted her pops Dillon to heed one 
 Ran some style about him pushin' on her privates 
 Look honey, I don't care if you kick five fits 
 There's no way that you can prove to me that Dill's flip 
 He might breathe a blunt but ya jeans he wouldn't rip 
 You're just mad he's your overseer at school 
 No need to play him out like he's someone cruel 
 She kicked that she would go get it from somewhere else 
 Yeah, whatever you say, go for ya self 
 Macy's department store, the scene for Santa's kisses 
 And all the little brats demandin' all of their wishes 
 Time passes by as I wait for my younger brother 
 He asks his wish, I waste no time to return him back to Mother 
 As I'm jettin', Millie floats in like a zombie 
 I ask her what's her problem, all she says is ""Where is he?"" 
 I give a point, she pulls a pistol, people screamin' 
 She shouts to Dill he's off to hell 'cause he's a demon 
 None of the kids could understand what was the cause 
 All they could see was a girl holdin' a pistol on Claus 
 Dillon pleaded mercy, said he didn't mean to 
 Do all the things that her mind could do nothing but cling to 
 Millie bucked him and with the quickness it was over"

 I wonder why I feel so good. Could it be the music? 
 Could it be my breakfast? Or could it just be the fact that 
 I just hate everybody, dammit! 
 Life is grand, life is great, I'll get myself a real cheap date. 
 Some woman I can take to McDonalds, spend a dollar twenty-five on,

 No matter how I dodge some jackal always nails me 
 No matter what the plot 
 And even out on tour they be like, 
 ""Yo I got a tape to play you back at the hotel"" 
 I be like ""Oh swell"" 
 Unveil the numeric code to dial my room 
 And tell them to call me at noon 
 But of course there's no answering machine in my room 
 But a pretty young adorer 
 Who I swung on tour 
 And if it rings while we're alone 
 She'll answer the phone 
 And with the quickness she'll recite like a poem 
 DOVE: 
 ""Hey, you done did the right thing, dial up my ring ring 
 Now you're waiting on the beep. 
 Say, I would love if you'd sing 
 The tune to Tru instead of fronting on the speak."" 
 So no problemo, just play the demo 
 And at the end it's break out time 
 Please oh please don't press rewind 
 'Cause I'll just lay it down the line

 Sorry ya can't get through 
 Why don't you leave your name and your number 
 And I'll get back to you

 Now ever so fab I said I'm wala 
 Miss Wild who used to run tough wit Koala 
 She was a winner of my metaphor and she knew that 
 I said I'm gonna feed your mouth she said you do that 
 Now Crystal stops the jeep I think I'm mad fly 
 She used to have a man wit lots of mad signs 
 Her strut was guaranteed to make a gay smile 
 And in bed she had proved to be real agile 
 I show her to the lounge and I dined her 
 Then she gave me some digits where I could find her 
 I licked her like a stamp 
 Laid and sticked her like a champ 
 But the... um she gave me burn 
 I had to go see the doctor

 A shooter man said ""Yo this is a stick up"" 
 A whole lot of dirt was 'bout to kick up 
 I had screens in my pocket 
 And man, tonight's my date 
 Wit Smokey Sue, now what was I to do? 
 In my head I'm thinking, 'Should I dodge the bullet?' 
 'Man this kid is bluffin' you can pull it'

 I got soul you see, I'm swimming in the De La 
 I'm in my hood man, my manhood worries ya 
 I'm known for sampling of soul food 
 Off the old school plates 
 When I met up with my niggas from the 718 
 One the Jungle Bro, the other Questers from Queens 
 Yet I had the matrix of the 516 in my jeans 
 Still I sided with my funk to bring my second on call 
 For me and the Sheep, our mission's on the beach of 804 
 (You're runnin' on an empty tank) 
 But still get paid in full 
 (And get the girls) 
 Man, I'm packing gravitational pull 
 Bring the instamatic avalanche, my code intervenes 
 I'm out to scout the areas that remains to be seen 
 (What?) 
 DOVE: 
 Well, many many digits had me seeking in my Wizard 
 Man, who's ringing up my area (ooh) oh! 
 I used to shoe it to the bridge but that's gone 
 Like the 718's out of Vietnam 
 Sniffin' skypagers had me drugged 
 (Man I knew a psycho) 
 703's on my love bug 
 I made mates with the brothers up in 215 
 Crazy buddhas in my mind 
 My Chattanooga champ had me late for the camp 
 And my 202 keeps me marvellous 
 I guess Mars was my hideaway 
 But if the stars for a getaway... 
 POS: 
 Since I'm capable I conjure up a walk in this way 
 I slip a syllable for Aspen and a Chester souffle 
 I be the 919 seeker, 'cause ain't off logic 
 So when I'm with my crew I always have a place to sit 
 Due to this, a brother tries to play me 
 (Yeah, like one in 514) 
 Yo, some kid tried to flip on me 
 They instigated a brawl 
 (So we set our knuckles on stun and made them all fall) 
 Then I just laughed 
 (Ha ha ha ha ha ha) 
 (We whooped that ass) 
 And put the feelings aside, I know who I am 
 I cast the grain by the pound 
 I make sounds with the horn 
 When I colour the corn, caught the fit 
 And sit the two when honey slung the tip 
 DOVE: 
 Well I'm taking my finds to the 301's 
 And I'm playing my flute in the rear kibbut 
 My man from the 908's, he don't like it like that 
 So I pipes till the sunshine hikes 
 A kettle of our master plan makes a Malibu idol 
 (God forgive me) Well, it's a hook 
 The third to the 0 to the 5 had top feel the vibe 
 When the 516 played convicts

 'Cause my semen ends with the letter T 
 My seed is hard to submerge

61,De La Soul,hiphop,I Am I Be,"I am Posdnous 
 I be the new generation of slaves 
 Here to make papes to buy a record exec rakes 
 The pile of revenue I create 
 But I guess I don't get a cut 'cause my rent's a month late 
 Product of a North Carolina cat 
 Who scratched the back of a pretty woman named Hattie 
 Who departed life just a little too soon 
 And didn't see me grab the Plug Tune fame 
 As we go a little somethin' like this 
 Look ma, no protection 
 Now I got a daughter named Ayana Monay 
 And I can play the cowboy to rustle in the dough 
 So the scenery is healthy where her eyes lay 
 I am an early bird but the feathers are black 
 So the apples that I catch are usually all worms 
 But it's a must to decipher one's queen 
 From a worm who plays groupie and spread around the bad germ 
 I cherish the twilight 
 I maximize, my soul is the right size 
 I watch for the power to run out on the moon 
 (And that'll be sometime soon) 
 Faker than a fist of kids 
 Speakin' that they're black 
 When they're just niggas trying to be Greek 
 Or some tongues who lied 
 And said ""We'll be natives to the end"" 
 Nowadays we don't even speak 
 I guess we got our own life to live 
 Or is it because we want our own kingdom to rule? 
 Every now and then I step to the now 
 For now I see back then I might have acted like a fool 
 Now I won't apologize for it 
 This is not a bunch of Bradys 
 But a bunch of black man's pride 
 Yet I can safely say 
 I've never played a sister by touching where her private parts reside 
 I've always walked the right side of the road 
 If I wasn't making song I wouldn't be a thug selling drugs 
 But a man with a plan 
 And if I was a rug cleaner 
 Betcha Pos'd have the cleanest rugs I am. 
 The Plug Two brand with the flavour 
 In the flute watch the sniffin' 
 So a sack of shows in demand 
 I read the diction from the second page 
 I got the one-two gauge 
 Baritone to the izm fan 
 Trees fall so I can play ground with my ink 
 So let me need ya to my ems go 
 I push the infinite and carry it 
 My carrier's the three over one 
 So my pluggins already know 
 Lick shots with moo 
 Catch the boo 
 From a ghost in the heckling crowd 
 If I give a foot 
 Jack Ville caught a spill 
 When a still came from my mouth 
 I brought a head down south 
 I don't check for the noose and the neck 
 So I never tell my ems 
 That finesse is knocking at my door 
 I choose to run from the rays of the burning sun 
 And dodge a needle washing up upon a sandy shore 
 I bring the element H with the 2 
 So ya owe me what's coming when I'm raining on your new parade 
 It's just mind over matter 
 And what matters is 
 That the mind isn't guided by the punished shade 
 I keep the walking on the right side 
 But I won't judge the next who handles walking on the wrong 
 'Cause that's how he wants to be 
 No difference, see 
 I wanna be like the name of this song I am 
 I am Posdnous 
 I be the new generation of slaves 
 Here to make papes to buy a record exec rakes 
 The pile of revenue I create 
 But I guess I don't get a cut 'cause my rent's a month late 
 The deeds of a natural 
 Are seeds that are no longer planted 
 So the famine in the mind is strong 
 Tactics of another plane is now proven sane 
 Sane enough to let you know from within this song 
 I stabilize many cableized viewers 
 So my occupation's known 
 But not why I occupy 
 And that is to bring the peace 
 Not in the flower but the As-Salaam Alaikum in the third I am"

 And how I relate, the same side of my gates 
 Paper days, mess up my mind, ground zero degrees 
 And the weather feels fine 
 You opened my eyes man, thought I had a man 
 But how could I eyescan, I wasn't around

 Gathered the new, from the zoas around 
 Grew up with Mikey Rodes and played the codes 
 Sometimes I don't budge, without my cous' Fuzz/fuzz 
 A simple, ""How ya do?"" Ah check it from my friends and my crew 
 Makes it definitely special 
 Now there's no +Shiny Happy People+ in the crew we play the rough

 Sip the capuccino slow 
 (BizMarkie) 
 In life, it's what you see is usually whatcha 
 (Posdonus) 
 Get, won't take a Drag-without-a-Net, no 
 (BizMarkie) 
 To put the rhythm in the, bone 
 (Posdonus) 
 Marrow, laid the pipe to please Cari-lou 
 (BizMarkie) 
 I don't know! 
 (Posdonus) 
 If it's true... 
 ... That's a fumble! 
 Well catch a fever from the jungle 
 Chocolate, nubian girls flock to it, sweets 
 And if I can't sample beats, get the 
 Beatbox equipped with the, dirt 
 BizMark and Doug E. works, fine 
 Mase work the wheel I tangle lines, HARK 
 The light is thirsty in the dark 
 So we... 
 * BizMarkie beatboxing while De La Soul chants the words ""I'll beatbox"" * 
 (Dove) 
 It's like I saw it in the river but my M wasn't fixed 
 Super heavy like a Chevy pump a Maseo mix 
 I had some screams in my pockets, and played it kinda hush 
 And did the outs (got to check out, the avenue) 
 I peeped the ?? Zoah ?? on the gimme gimme, plus we hit the plat' 
 Then the amps was on samp's, the villains got fat 
 The Natives weren't the neighbor then to, NIGGA PLEASE 
 It's a hustle for a joint when your settlement G's 
 But we still be on the wax because it acts like that 
 We still be on the moves because it moves like that 
 So there ain't no reason to don't stop 
 'Cause we can bring it back to the beatbox! 
 * BizMark finishes it off * 
 ""Yo who, I don't know who was on the mic man 
 This thing smell awful here man.."""

69,De La Soul,hiphop,Sh.Fe.MC's,"We are here to tell the world just who we are 
 Shocking female (MC's), shocking female (MC's) (Repeat 2x) 
 Verse 1: Phife 
 No need for, introductions, 'cause I know you know my name and 
 Knocking MC's out the frame and, putting them suckers to shame and 
 I live for hip-hop, so I have no time for fun and games and 
 So just come and peep the unique styles we are displaying 
 The beat's just ridiculous, the lyrics articulate 
 Feels good, as if a girl just touched her (tits) 
 Sucker MC's, I'm killing 'em, I'm so sick of seeing 'em 
 Silly (shit) when they rhyme, like that red rugby shirt worn by Gilligan 
 Plus the hat, they (shit) is wack 
 When you see me coming take ten steps back 
 I make usage of the pronouns, adjectives, verbs 
 My granny says ""You always had a way with words"" 
 And that's because my word is bond, lyrics are laws 
 Sucker MC's look at me like I'm friggin' eye sore 
 Verse 2: Posdnuos 
 Heere comes a brother hipping others on the style they lack 
 I've always rhymed abstract, I even know the brother named Abstract 
 I am the earner of the soul in mine 
 Forget the physical cause the physical will die with time 
 I'm shaped to vibrate in definite proportions 
 Of the kids who need the fix (Just listen to the mix) 
 I just imagine constant non-stop for the rubbishing 
 Like (niggas) use the Clinton loops as if they owned the publishing 
 Ducks be bleeding from illegal feeding on my verb 
 I bring the Mardi Gras to your face 
 I outwit vipers in my rhyme cipher 
 I can easily lick them 'cause they're victims of the subconscious race 
 Tossing periods in front of false reps? 
 It's not the 187 when the 360 slept 
 You swallow the cake from the plate of elevate 
 Or you might get sparked by the crew who got the weight 
 So recessitating rap like the hicks do with Presley 
 It's the kid who peed the jeans in Orleans off of Nesley 
 Just be MC number nine, if you let me rhyme nine times infinitely I will 
 Climb 
 I let my Walkman from Sony play cassettes from Raboni 
 Which guarantees to put me on the narrow road 
 Ayo, that's it from me, Plug 3, and Ali explode 
 Verse 3: Q-Tip 
 When I rhyme, the effect just ripples 
 You sound sick, I hope your cells get sickles 
 You formulate into real stiff (shit) 
 Then I bet that it cut the chit chit 
 Cause the Ab will, be sharper than a Ginsu 
 Cutter or your bum (ass) head for the gutter 
 This is not a game and we ain't looking for the fame 
 That ain't the aim, we came to rip the jam out the frame 
 My inter-reaction with paper is amazing 
 So needless to say mad trails are left blazing 
 A whole lot of bull (shit) rhymes start to get play 
 But I'm here to say real rhymes to pay 
 I'm the type of brother that writes until my knuckles get nary 
 And through the domepiece, the rhymes will carry 
 Then transported to my throat then the quotes hit the air 
 As I stand dipped with the wares 
 Rhymes get slot times, move back from the jack 
 It's the verbal constructor, some MC's is wack 
 I make a girl do the bogle, doo doo brown and all 
 Make (niggas) jump up, drink Don, and have a ball 
 I ainimate the unlively with the verbal combat 
 The Abstract, never the wack 
 Motivator of the many like Moses 
 Moving through, bringing games into the dummies that pose us 
 That means you the sub relator of the sub culture 
 Like a vulture I swoop down on crowns, cause confusion all around 
 Mental burdens I bring to MC's who sing 
 They sad songs, money, the dough's not long 
 Mine on the other hand is lent me tight 
 The Abstract gets real, real, real 
 Verse 4: Dove 
 Real down to Earth I hit the Long Island Rail 
 You never see me tango with the horn and the tail 
 I got the kid for your mind I design it like sender 
 Smoking made hope from my neighbors, and the 
 50/50 luck takes the ""S"" off my chest 
 Cause the ""S"" on my chest makes a mess 
 Settling for Superman, stupid man, put on your glasses 
 Now your (ass) be slow guessing like molasass 
 Continue the menu, next on the platter 
 Hey where that (bitch) at? (He's right here boy!) 
 I gotta see what I got and who I'm getting it with 
 This ain't no nickel dime game that I'm peddling with 
 Mikie Rose said ""Stop riding, it be dividing 
 Taking me out how I be vibing"" 
 Packing hard like pistol but my pops got the crystal 
 Told me if I ever need it just *whistle* 
 Respects to Griff Dog for the razor 
 Much respects to Joe but for the favor 
 It's about a million brothers trying to make it in this world 
 I'm glad I got a baby girl"
70,De La Soul,hiphop,Stix & Stonz,"Chorus: All 
 If you can dig it, deal with it, if you can't, just forget it 
 Cause nobody rocks the party like we 
 Get loose, get loose, Sunshine get loose 
 Just rock, and show 'em you got juice 
 And have, have, have, have, have, have, have fuuuuuuun! 
 Verse 1: LA Sunshine 
 I know it's been a while since the last time 
 You're heard LA Sunshine pick up the microphone and rhyme 
 But now I think it's time to go for mine 
 So you can sit back, relax, just max and unwind 
 Because it's time for me to out a few heads to bed 
 Because I'm upset at what somebody said 
 I've heard it through the grapevine it's been said 
 That Sunshine, can't rhyme? 
 Ha! That's the funniest line that I heard in a long time 
 The wanna be me's that they I sound off beat 
 I'm not off beat, I'm totally unique and it sounds real sweet 
 So if you're ready, get set for a trip to the sun 
 You'll be guided, and I've decided to become 
 One to take total control of your soul 
 Young or all be bold because it's a sight to behold 
 Sticks and stones might break your bones but Pos is gonna blow your mind 
 Ain't no need to hold it (Let it go!) Just one more time! 
 Verse 2: Posdnuos 
 Now you can bet that I'm first kick a watt 
 Soul son, Plug One, Posdnuos I'm top notch 
 Forward, backstep, got cabbage on the brain 
 So I'm leafy, peasy, and I act kind of sane 
 So homeboys and girls just come follow me 
 I'm the fried pipe piper down with dub and Plug Three 
 I like my man's, freestyle is not my flow 
 But I gets mad respect from Norfolk to Glasgow 
 I run this up to court about a minute to the sec 
 Cause my hoodie won't clash with Whipper Whip's mockneck 
 So my hip-hop teachers please show me the math 
 And after this give me your goddamn autograph 
 Whipper Whip, you can make the microphone sing 
 Walking around sporting your diamond ring 
 All the ladies know you as an MC king 
 So get on the mic and tell 'em it ain't no thing 
 Verse 3: Whipper Whip 
 Well the Prince is my title and, I do what I must do 
 When rappers get beside themselves, that's when I bust two 
 Or three, see it doesn't matter to me 
 Cause the W-H-I-P's got an army 
 Whipper Whip, the Whipster, money gripster 
 Can't stand the tipster unless she got the hips to 
 Move a mountain, left on Kingsly and Fountain 
 1345 is where I used to count them 
 The grips in my bucket's the kind that choke horses 
 No more losses and no toy mosses 
 It's the Kings of Kingsly, from Bronx to Hollywood 
 I'm Whipper Whip, I but the G in ""good"" 
 Yo I can blow like a whistle, run far beyond average 
 Been rapping to the man like Randy Savage 
 You be the judge, come stand as I slam some 
 There's open invitation to all and then some 
 Sticks and stones might break your bones but JD Dub is gonna blow your mind 
 Ain't no need to hold it (Let it go!) Just one more time! 
 Verse 4: Dove 
 I kick the Chatanooga Choo Choo so listen to the calling 
 Next stop's the body rock, here's the ticket to my clock 
 It's the flips, but keep your jaws on your hips 
 >From back in the days I used to air it to the hits 
 Earn the dance step and guaranteed to play the wheel to wheel 
 And Wild Style was the real, dig it? 
 I block the heckles and hecks and gets nuff respects 
 Without the ""bah diddy bah"" I couldn't go and cash checks 
 DJ Mase, since you got the bass, why don't you hit it, hit it? 
 Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it! 
 The do re, the mi phi, the sol la, the Tito 
 Rocking it, rocking it, yes he is rocking it 
 Tito, rocking it! 
 Verse 5: Tito 
 Smiggity smoking, no joking, turning styles like a token 
 No singer, but swinging rap lyric like a ringer 
 I'm solo, like Bobo, breaking backs like Bolo 
 No kitten, no hitting booby traps for the sitting 
 Ducks should I mention rhyme breezing like Benson 
 Or hedges, I'm fuming autographs for the human 
 Being, I'm g-ing, off like keying 
 Or Keenan, live Ivory, Waynan, who's slaying? 
 A TV or movie, hit singles often move me 
 Like groove me, they got me lingers like a ??? 
 No slipping, no tripping on me while I'm ripping 
 Slam dunking like a donut on the Bulls Scottie Pippen 
 A vocab that's no fad, I'm Heftier than Glad bags 
 My son's about 2, buckaroo and yelling ""Go dad!"" 
 Sticks and stones might break your bones but Superstar's blows your mind 
 Ain't no need to hold it (Let it go!) Just one more time! 
 Verse 6: Superstar 
 I get the honor to rap with some old school greats 
 Caz, Whipper Whip, Tito, and LA 
 Maseo, Posdnuos, Trug, they from the new school 
 A perfect blend from the old and new 
 Superstar, where did I fit in? How did I get in? 
 Where did I begin, sin? 
 I'm known from Belcourt to Freeport, not a West Coast or Five Boroughs 
 Yeah, my name's whispered in the ghettos 
 When I'm on stage, I write a book, flip a page 
 Write a chapter, and leave a hell of a phrase 
 Now, before I go, you know that I'm a pro, yo 
 You won't forget me, why, because I flow 
 So GMC, ha, GMC, ha ha, GMC ha, GMC, ha ha 
 GMC, ha huh! (Yo my throat is sore) 
 Yo, get on the mic, stay on the mic (dammit) 
 Rock on the mic with your rhymes galore! 
 Verse 7: Grandmaster Caz 
 Well I'm a black act back to attack the wack New Jack 
 Smack the sad sack track with the stack of facts 
 True old data, see you later alligator 
 Raid or raider Darth Vader, 'cause I'm greater or rater 
 Made a plate of soul food, barbequed a rude dude with the attitude 
 Who got screwed 'cause he chewed 
 But I'm a writer, you can't take a bite of 
 So light up your lighter and watch me recite a 
 Dope verse or two with the curse or two, yeah rehearse a cue 
 But first a few minutes of funk, preferably seven 
 Microphones, all I need is one 
 MC's to school, ten or eleven then a bottle of Don 
 When the job is done, but don't stop me now 
 I'm on a roll, control the whole stroll 
 And bowl the whole toll, fold the known souls 
 Patrol shoot the fruit, toot toot the hoot 
 Scoot with the loot and knock a cute suit boots 
 Entertain your brain like Kane, not strain to maintain my main (shit) stain 
 Walls record us, break through the borders 
 All the manslaughters and kidnap daughters 
 Who are building and chlling in the building with a villain 
 I'm killing and illing but still in like Bob Dylan 
 I'm Democratic emphatic erratic static I'm good at it 
 And suckers get gatted with the automatic 
 Rhymes are plenty, styles are many 
 Yeah, and that's as real as Jimmy sticking Jenny 
 If anybody knows a trick to slip my wig 
 With a lick or real sick with a lyrical brick 
 He's a vick bound to get tracked off 
 Step to the Grandest and you'll get slapped off 
 Stage, and thoroughly stomped with the quickness 
 Now can I get a witness, 'cause I'm out"

 Expressway when I heard it)

 POS: 
 Channeling, in sync so my what brings that testament 
 To cover twelve inches of funk 
 Flip like as if I was the Dalek himself 
 Specialising in cleansing like the its of 
 Elephants, Dove hits bibles out the park, man 
 Don't wven try to toss bleach, I'm too dark and 
 Major more soul than James' ""Escapism"" 
 De La Soul is here to stay like racism 
 Patrick know and I'mma put the pillow off the bed 
 As I lurk up on your thoughts while phones on your head 
 Riff a tech pro, flex Sue, running you the links 
 Scout weather, pouring rain outta duck's survive links 
 And if one winks for pink slips, the slips are short 
 Dull-minded as sperm, to give out for the souls I report 
 I sport too fly for the forty-ounce drinker 
 I sport too fly for a forty-ounce thinker 
 A fresh linen scent so sniffer on the two-inch 
 A talker of the berg without weed influence 
 So stick to you Naughty By Natures and your Kane 
 'Cause graffiti that I based upn the wax is insane 
 DOVE: 
 Grand groove, I wish I had the flavor bid 
 Give me six bottles of beer, I take the seventh one free 
 I got the chandelier, kick, constructed by my man 
 Little elf, big four gets the zootie for the self 
 Long Island living, what, twelve o'clock dawn 
 Jiggy-not see me so I trip straight to your porches 
 Mr Partymaker puts the boogers in your bottle 
 Straw it and drink, what bees gotta be's 
 'Cause I snort the crazy-crazies 
 Man, I kick the Franken-style, dig the bolts in my neck 
 Wreck, ship, boat, rock 
 Heavy metal grooves ain't the infinite 
 Here I hips to the hops 
 I'm looking for the words in the faces of a prince 
 That brother been down ever since soaked cheese 
 And motor go smiling 
 Hey, how ya doin' 
 Now, meet in front of Big Lou's fighting 
 Hey, y'all reminisce, six streets, little miles 
 Straight to my avenue 
 (Ah... aaaggh) 
 Six streets, went miles straight to my avenue 
 I'm headed for the bigger E, for the bitter OE, not me 
 Here's my Malibu, child, here's my Malibu 
 Buckshot honeys, dig a gun and go ah..."

 Every woman and man wanna *emcee* 
 But for what, I tell you *emcee*ing ain't for you! 
 Hey, whatever happened to the *emcees* 
 Times done changed for the *emcees* 
 Every woman and man wanna *emcee* 
 But for what, I tell you *emcee*ing ain't for you! 
 Verse One: Dove 
 Man I'm on the set like the flicks so let your parents flash 
 A splash bigger than whales, I'm makin' monsters mash 
 Spit Pinnochio's Theory when shit be looking weary 
 I need rest, but I boogie for now, I'm on some mess 
 Like the best mics respond to me 
 Living days, like dreams of specializing in the art that pays 
 I be a mystic for life, so check my ID number 
 Emcees be kneading/needing dough while I make bread like Wonder 
 Yes, that's what you heard, so save that acting for the screen 
 See you can can that manager with the beans 
 I bust emcees like lies surprise 'em out the box 
 Put away the soda pops I'd rather rub on the rocks 
 A dime-getter tried to get what I got, for what? 
 I guess Southern folks cash makes the lovin' come fast 
 But I'm past alla that, it's time to break with the breeze 
 Get to your knees, here comes the Supa Emcees 
 Verse Two: Pos 
 Within this program of rap, I eradicate the glitches 
 Yo I'm dark like Wesley, but I be sparkin more bitches 
 Entering my constellation put your lives in jep 
 While you others represent, I present my rep 
 'Cause when it comes to making dents, I'm that main imprint 
 Even smoke from blunts which give eyes the reddish tint 
 Could not prevent, YOU from seeing I'm the light 
 But bring attention to my words like some ads in tights 
 I heard you want to fight me, with your words on stage 
 So Mase pulls that instrumental from the jam YOU made 
 And as he starts cutting what you sold, I'll talk all over your tones 
 As if my name was Pete Rock or Sean ""Puffy"" Combs 
 Send your tattered ass home, with celly phones I roam 
 With my fleet, here to make this rap game complete 
 While you live fables, unstable, acting very radical 
 Projecting like you're hard, when in fact you're quite vaginal"
73,De La Soul,hiphop,The Bizness,"Intro: Common (Craig Mack sample from ""Get Down"") 
 And and bass up the track a little bit 
 'Cause I I'm here I wanna hear that boom bish boom, knowhatI'msayin? 
 Yeah yeah you know the bizness 
 Common Sense, soul with the De La 
 Get all them play-ahs 
 We the rhyme sayers 
 Huh, and that's the bizness, hah 
 Gonna do it like this 
 Gettin' it that 
 Like the Chicago streets 
 Verse One: Dove 
 I speak divine of God theories, no need to be high 
 Always exhale the facts 'cause I don't inhale lye/lie 
 Play the greater man's game, to bounce off my losses 
 So I can earn the acres (uh) the houses (yeah) the horses (huh) 
 Of course it's much greater than your Benx or your Lex 
 The engine to my comprehension is just too complex 
 Much too complex, EFX/effects be live like Das 
 Making moves down South, to avoid the chaos 
 And never, flaunt the coin 'cause dime-getters be gazin 
 They call me Luther Van, they say my style is so Amazin 
 I'm fazin those who're supposed to have the last laughter 
 'Cause even when I'm gone I'm reappearin in the after 
 I haveta, send respects to real money makers 
 Do not connect us with those champaign sippin money fakers 
 Taste the quarter pound with spice from Chi-town 
 Now what that prove, you're so full you can't even move 
 'Cause I'm the D-to-the-O, the-V-to-the-E 
 And can't another brother cook these delicacies 
 Well I'm the P-L-U, the G-to-the-One 
 Walk around the planet earth making money having fun 
 And I'm the C-to-the-O, double-M-O-N 
 I sit and think with a drink about how I'm gonna win 
 I'm the C-to-the-O, double-M-O-N 
 I sit and think with a drink... 
 Verse Two: Common 
 Do you wanna be a MC? Or do you wanna serve 
 Do you wanna be dope? Or do you wanna deal it 
 Fabricated acryllic, I feel it, I'm the style molester 
 I do a show get Extra P's like the Large Professor 
 In fact I get more hoes than Tessa, peep game like a 
 Refa-ree in soul control of my 
 Desti-ny, in the best of, three out of five 
 Whip ANYBODY ass at NBA Live, rappers 
 Take a dive like Greg Lougainis with his bitch-ass 
 Rather be in Bebe's alley, than at the click with gators 
 Not a hater of the players, I'm more like a coach, or an owner 
 I Used To Love H.E.R., but now I bone her (ahuh-hah!) 
 At one point in rhyme I thought I lost my erection 
 But then I got it back with the Resurrection, blessings 
 Upon rhymes old man who called him traitor 
 Big Com Stradamus niggaz styles I predict 
 I'm the C-to-the-O, double-M-O-N 
 I sit and think with a drink about how I'm gonna win 
 And I'm the D-to-the-O, the-V-to-the-E 
 And can't no other brother cook these delicacies 
 Well I'm the P-L-U, the-G-to-the-One 
 Walk around the planet earth making money having fun 
 Walk around the planet earth making money having fun 
 Walk around the planet earth making money having fun 
 Verse Three: Pos 
 I'm the most from the coast of the East, then flee 
 Droppin' more knowledge than litter, on the New York pave 
 It's me, wonder why, in the place to be 
 Certified, as superior, MC 
 While others explore to make it hardcore 
 I make it hard for, wack MC's to even step inside the door 
 Cause these kids is rhyming, sometiming 
 And when we get to racing on the mic, they line up to see 
 The lyrical killing, with stained egos on the ceiling 
 My rhymes escalates like black death rates 
 Over musical plates, being played as the rule 
 Kids thinking stepping to the Soul, you're labelled fools 
 Who claims to drop jewels but for now you do the catching 
 I don't worry on what crew you run, or what section of earth 
 You reside, you're not even a man 
 So I don't seem it mandatory taking your pride 
 But I will, cause my man said Soul for the life 
 You cried ""Keepin' it real"", yet you should try keepin' it right 
 That's understanding microphone mathematics 
 Which leaves the currency in temporary world status 
 And when one shows he posed threat to this one 
 This one will make that one into none 
 Simple equation, zero, you shouldn't play hero 
 If you can't stand Strong like the Island I'm from 
 Now I'm the P-L-U, the-G-to-the-One 
 Walk around the planet earth making money having fun 
 Yeah, and I'm the-C-to-the-O, double-M-O-N 
 I sit and think with a drink about how I'm gonna win 
 And I'm the D-to-the-O, the-V-to-the-E 
 And can't another brother cook these delicacies 
 See can't another brother cook these delicacies 
 See can't another brother cook these delicacies 
 Outro: Common 
 Ah that's how, that's how I'm supposed to do my thing huh 
 Like triple it, all right 
 That's how we do it, all the way from Strong Island to Chicago 
 The type of freestyler flow 
 Yeah, it's fluent, and we don't need to flow no more 
 Hah

 Let me tell you a little something about Soul (tell 'em son) 
 I be a piece of the East coast, so give a toast to 
 Plug Wonder why back in the day who soaked his words in jigga 
 So when I ran a phrase in June you didn't catch it till December 
 I'm a member of them kids from the inner city 
 Giving you kitties audible treats, you be aching for making 
 More money than a pagan holiday 
 Not from the PJ's, yet I still got something to say"

 Attack a hit to go beyond this age of rap counterfeits 
 Out of the heavens August one-seven, sixty-nine 
 Born I, wonder why with the thoughts to rhyme 
 Till there was no longer thoughts to dream 
 When an unpolished demo led to limos at the age of eighteen 
 Accompanied by the screams, Plug One 
 Shot up with fame like novacaine it made me numb 
 So numb I wouldn't been able to feel 
 Niggaz diggin in my pockets for my currency reels 
 But still, I make girls brown eyes blue at will (until) 
 My ass was no longer mass appeal 
 Oh shit, I guess that was all the fame I was alloted 
 Wait a minite, new video, like a leopard I'm spotted 
 In a night club chillin' with Kamaal and Phife 
 I be that farmer cultivating owning acres of mics 
 And I likes to make it known Strong Island stylin 
 For a while, so do that dance 
 (Are you rockin' the spot?) Yes I be 
 (Showin others they do not?) Yes I be 
 (Havin' then towed from the lot?) Yes I be 
 That's my job as a supa emcee, I'm from Long Isle 
 Mobile, make it worth your while 
 If the jam needs motion I'm the one to dial 
 (Goin' beyond ninety watts) Yes I be 
 (Well are you rockin' it?) Yes, yes I be (rockin' it!) 
 I can stress the makin' of loot to feed the fam 
 While the voices impersonate the true who I am 
 Buzzin in my ear, oh you one of those wannabees 
 Always buzzin in my ear you down with supa emcees 
 Steppin to me with your pleas that you gots, butter rhymes 
 Man the only thing butter 'bout you is your spine 
 Mad yellow, you can't rock the Mardi Gras, my mellow 
 Cause my stealth show more than knowledge of self 
 I got knowlegde of you, to know you a wack em-crew 
 (You mean wack emcee) Nah, a wack em-crew, see you a crew of wack niggaz 
 You should have never tried to test 
 These words that I Man, with the eye/I to Fest 
 While you sayin' one thing really meaning the next 
 You're just a contra-DICK, your mind's been tampered WITH 
 Like some holy boooks, but looks to the sky 
 Cause Wonder Why's here to save the day 
 (Are you rockin' the spot?) Yes I be 
 (Showin others they do not?) Yes I be 
 (Havin' then towed from the lot) Yes I be 
 Cause ultimately, I'm lettin all MC's know that 
 What's the name of this crew? (De La, De La) 
 Well all right, and what be the dish we servin'? 
 (We servin' pos-da!) Posdanos help the next get loose 
 Like an alcohol scenario rap be on the rocks 
 Authenticity that missin' fee to pay to join the flock of MC 
 These niggaz stand lower than knees 
 Dramatized in they eyes as the ones to please 
 When rap kids apply violent pressure to father, brother and son 
 For fun to say they inflict pain 
 R&B niggaz lie to mother, sister, and daughter 
 To have sex disguised as lovin' in the rain 
 Their words are more hallow than October 31st 
 What's worse, hate to see the females 
 Switch to sexual mentality, it doesn't match with they given anatomy 
 Man they rather be hoes like that male emcee 
 Who walk around like they got nuts 
 And use the tits and ass like a crutch 
 Man the underground's about not bein exposed 
 So you better take you naked ass and put on some clothes 
 Man this be goin' out to the kids from east smash (long island) 
 Amityville (long island) 
 To all my people out in whinedance, bayshore (long island) 
 C.I.'s in the place (long island) 
 Brinkwood, hempstead, all my (long island) 
 Brothers out in roosevelt, freeport (long island) 
 Uniondale to long beach (long island) 
 To them girls out in huntington (long island) 
 Long island for real (long island)"

 While you searchin for some trick 
 To put the shit in her name 
 I be spendin on wall street 
 And buyin' boardwalk 
 Dodging problems of the world 
 Drawn out in white chalk 
 Peace, mr. war 
 I'm seein' all dimensions 
 But unlike your eye extensions 
 My vision don't blur 
 'What' 'when' and 'word's 
 Where the gossip occur 
 Heard I'm sexin' sade 
 And I bought her a fur 
 Battin' eyes at toni braxton 
 And I bought her a fur 
 Now I'm hittin' whitney houston 
 Oh, she bought me a fur? 
 Far-fetched like glass teks

 I'm pourin out these rhymes 
 For them kids who ain't here 
 Stakes is high 
 But we gonna try to have fun this year 
 Before there were guns 
 There was native tongues on these plains 
 But others on 
 Without them being pawns in this game 
 'Cause a pawn in this game 
 Is left with no game to play 
 So, um, you best ta check 
 And hear what we got to say 
 Now if you came to party 
 Just let it be known 
 Now if you came to fight 
 You might get that head flown 
 By the one and only 
 Maseo plug third 
 J.D. dove plays the wall 
 As kenny cal spurts words 
 And a number 
 To a crew of dope girls from the woods 
 And not dope meaning weed 
 But dope meaning (good) 
 Like them west coast kids 
 Who be throwin' up signs 
 I hate a buster 
 Unless his name is busta rhymes 
 So check the way my mind moves 
 Over times and grooves 
 Got some money to blow 
 Wonder why wanna know

76,De La Soul,hiphop,Brakes,"There's a lot of people out here 
 Who just don't know 
 What plays a factor 
 In movin' heads and toes 
 It be them hits 
 Hangin' out of them stereo kits 
 Whether cassette radio or CD bits 
 Mix tapes from the best 
 Going on and on 
 Throughout the city grounds 
 To suburban lawns 
 Man, we don't play 
 Even where we stay 
 Videos shows the visuals 
 Of jams today 
 Coinciding with the rhythm 
 Of the heart and neck 
 The brakes got you 
 In your proper context 
 You let your lex or your 
 Sixty-four suspension 
 Bounce away all your tension 
 En route to the club 
 Where girls need the quenchin' 
 Diamonds on your wrist 
 Sunroof top 
 But niggas out front 
 Makin' guns go pop 
 So the spot gets shut 
 But on to the next 
 'Cause your ears get vexed 
 When they don't get the fix cause

 While you're doin' your chores

 No matter where you from 
 It's for you and yours 
 (These are the brakes) 
 Bringing it back to the brakes 
 Like the 'yes yes y'all' 
 (These are the brakes) 
 So let it be your anthem 
 When you're havin' a ball 
 Well it's silly of me 
 To think that I 
 Would never get a chance to see 
 A piece of this pie 
 I sat dead in front of speakers 
 Thinkin' that could be me 
 Anticipatin' open microphones 
 So I could emcee 
 Had a catalogue of raps 
 Impressin' all the 'round-the-wayers 
 Before I went to bed 
 Included rhymes into my prayers 
 But that rhyme is all on paper 
 I want my song on vinyl plates 
 I dreamin' hits and doin' shows 
 Makin' my niggas spines shake 
 Expectin' nuttin but a little bit 
 Of radio play 
 Gettin' diced on 1 and 2's 
 By the best djs, hey 
 Time was kinda tight 
 But still I dotted on the line 
 And some expected me 
 To start buhlooning in the mind 
 Seein' spaces and places 
 That I couldn't pronounce 
 But still I had the pulleys 
 To make all the bullies bounce 
 With the blessings of the great 
 We took it from state to state 
 'Cause we landed on the good foot 
 And got our biggest brake cause 
 (These are the brakes) 
 A mother gets mugged 
 By her crackhead son 
 ""That's the brakes, that's the brakes"" 
 You're in the wrong part of town 
 So the shots make you run 
 ""That's the brakes, that's the brakes"" 
 Your best comrades put six tabs 
 In your o.e. 
 ""That's the brakes, that's the brakes"" 
 Your boyfriend made you a carrier of HIV 
 ""That's the brakes, that's the brakes"" 
 Now what's gonna happen 
 When the sun don't shine 
 I'm buyin tickets aboard 
 The caravan of love 
 Hey fellas 
 See, money don't make shots repel 
 I break woes and compose 
 Some rhymes to tell 
 So when the party's live 
 It shouldn't be beef 
 Or playin' Indian roles 
 I guess you thought you was chief 
 Seems all broke up 
 And now you woke up surprised 
 Situation's gettin' sticky 
 Dead in front of your eyes 
 We play the wall 
 Similar to tacks 
 Until the DJ plays 
 The necessary track 
 In fact as the jam plays on 
 Out comes all your bread 
 To pay for drinks 
 For them girls you want to spread 
 Don't be mislead 
 When the brakes inside your head 
 And have you reminiscing 
 On them kids who got you fed 
 Until reality reveals a miss 
 Who wants to know 
 If you can play her real close 
 Out on the dance floor 'cause 
 (These are the brakes) 
 It be your listenin pleasure 
 While you're doin' your chores 
 (These are the brakes) 
 No matter where you from 
 It's for you and yours

 Like the 'yes yes y'all'

 Realistically explicit

 Man, it's all about mind 
 Keeping focused 
 On them self-mechanisms of rhyme 
 So no longer stand erect

 Walkin' round 
 Manifesting attributes of shame 
 Used to sQuabble for the mic 
 But now accordingly 
 We act 
 Unless a club can't afford the fee 
 We act 
 So name that any best man 
 To put us under 
 Created from the ground 
 Yet know nothin' 
 'Bout the under 
 Take a glimpse 
 At them pimps 
 Playin' record exec 
 Addin up all your zeros 
 So's to cut you a check 
 Saying why the blunder wonder 
 Could've g'd today 
 So you can put up some swings 
 For your seed to play 
 But a swing ain't that important 
 When the park's around the corner 
 Filled with life causing death 
 Greeting victims for the morning 
 It was the moment I feared 
 Nah, the moment I steered 
 Upon the right path 
 To know the right math 
 To over stand 
 It's a dog eat dog competition (no doubt)

79,De La Soul,hiphop,Long Island Degrees,"Verse One: Maseo 
 It's strong island for real, where the critters run wild 
 The prefix is 516, the top of the dial 
 Trhough the L.I. Sound, to the villa down under 
 And across the globe I heard a lot of folks wonderin' 
 So when's it coming 'cause the stakes is high see big money that waves 
 Don't put the pen to my page 
 And ain't nothin' wrong with standing still and relaxing 
 And spendin' some of that cash that Uncle Sam is gonna tax 
 A New York demeanor is sit back in the beamer 
 With nothing to lose but some gas and some minutes 
 Ignorin' the gazers 'cause some stars don't get petty 
 And that trash you talk is just New Years confetti 
 It's like that y'all, but that's all 'bout to change 
 Like some of my own, people tend to act strange 
 I'm making a scene, and it's served with it's capabilities 
 So set it at an island's degrees 
 Posdanous: 
 It's strong island for real, the diagnosis is supreme 
 The prefix is 516, where microphones fiend 
 The voices that gots the gift, 'cause the world is on their shoulders 
 Makein' plans to switch from little rock to money boulders 
 The real proceed 
 My girl stands deep from nubians actin' like Columbians sellin' keys 
 Characters have the tendency to con themselves 
 To think the East Coast is only New York and Philadelph 
 You know the way we blow, your shit is played like pork 
 And as for what we be bringin' you, we live and direct from New York 
 I ougtta say my fam causes commercs. 
 Steppin' to me fool will get you punched out like a curse 
 It's like that y'all, let it all consume 
 Like them brothas who smoke, till they high like the moon 
 Soon to a town near you be them super emcees 
 Settin' them Long Island degrees 
 Maseo: 
 I hit the L.I.R.R. for big dreamers out east 
 And get your bank roll split 
 Bangin' dents out your systems 
 Sellin' points to get the uppercut like Sonny Liston 
 But eyes closed episodes 
 Bring you back to zeroes 
 The same herp playin' like he Casablanca 
 Blind to it, but I'm a grind him up a cup of Sanka 
 Servin' dimes loves on tennis courts and sorts 
 Laid back like grown folks sippin' tea for sport 
 Posdanous: 
 I be sweepin' up the room with my lyrical broom 
 While others rhymes smell like plastic like some lunch room utensil 
 The official color for this planet is green 
 Which growns in pockets of them people willing to scheme 
 An't no expose, these facts are from the mouth 
 Profilin' through Island with that wind from down south 
 At last, be the world broad cast from the crew who gave you 3's 
 Magic on an island degrees 
 Maseo: 
 It's strong island for real where the critters smoke fritters 
 Night time excites time for the heavy hitters 
 Gang on hers 'cause in the mean time mine is home on date 
 Fluffin' pillows impatiently waitin' ain't no debatin' 
 'Bout to settle, check the level stakes is high as the sky 
 I got questions about your life if you so ready to die 
 We in the last quarter y'all, somebody's gonna cry 
 I think they need to set the clock before the time pass by 
 Posdanous: 
 In the round one no nines my size can get swelly 
 Sensing danger I will play a ranger on my celly with my felly 
 We're wonderful like colorful flix 
 Provide a thread and needle every time the stages get ripped 
 I grip upon the pleasure sippin' the tea 
 On the island 'cause that island is the main artery 
 So uh, you better come and give respect for catch some of these 
 Knucks from the island degrees"

 Mummy I saw one day 
 She was on some fume vapors 
 Givin' me lip so I continued with the caper 
 Cat litter had me sniffin 
 Since outside the palace 
 Eyes sicker than aids 
 Game harder than a callous 
 Tried to enter in her shit 
 She had locks on the session 
 Tellin' me how her last man 
 Taught her ass a lesson damn 
 Well, I'm not the mayor 
 I take care of my dimes 
 But I excluded I had nickels 
 Addin' up to her kind 
 Short stacks with a wristful of jewels 
 Sayin' she didn't need a man 
 To make her out for a fool 
 Dig it, miss, my love is credited in cupid account 
 And if you need that extra help 
 I got the extra amount 
 Gigglin, figurin' I had jokes for her humor 
 Then she broke out with the words 
 About knowin' all the rumors 
 ""See, all you niggas rappin' be like pedigree dogs 
 Thinkin' you can have me leashed 
 Around your microphone cords"" 
 Somethin' 'bout her lit me up like July 
 And with them onions in the pants 
 I couldn't help but cry 
 Seemed lost in the essence 
 But I had to find my way to take 
 Action for the digits just to set up a date 
 Thought my shinin was on 
 I had the skirts in the bag 
 Until I took a bit of time 
 To peep the price on the tag 
 She said ""I'm that salt and pepa 
 Who like pushin it to sisters 
 You need to get to walkin' with it mister, 
 I think you betta listen"" 
 (Listen all you fellas, here's what good love is)

 We was at some outside jam one Saturday night 
 When this pretty ass girl got locked in my sight 
 She was a ghetto philosopher 
 Yeah you know the type 
 Thinkin' Mary J. and sade understood her strife 
 Caught me lookin', ""Yo what's cookin?"" 
 ""Nothin' from around here 
 So don't approach or hope 
 To be the man of the year"" 
 I said listen deer or rabbit or whatever the hell you be 
 I'm not the one to embarrass 
 But the one to emcee 
 I traveled the world q uarters on my relationships 
 Used and abused by hoes 
 So my royalty stubs 
 But above all 
 I brought my daughter into this earth 
 So I understand the need 
 Of women feeling of worth 
 She glanced deep in my eyes 
 And said ""oh shit, you're ill 
 I like the way your mind 
 Moves around at will 
 Still, let me apologize for soundin so sassy 
 But you niggas act as if my ass 
 Has a sign that says harass me"" 
 Her name was gail from the union of dale 
 I made her remove the shades 
 So her eyes could tell me the plan 
 Yo where's your man? 
 ""Oh that nigga's past tense, 
 Painted bruises on my face 
 Haven't seen him ever since"" 
 Gave a pinch to my bottom 
 And started rubbing my back 
 She said ""i bet your ass is darker 
 Than a mobb deep track"" 
 Only one way to know it, 
 And I was down to show it 
 So we jetted back to my crib to set it 
 She made it known 
 ""I've owned thoughts of you 
 Since that song 'meeny-meeny' 
 Can't believe you're about 
 To be all up in between me"" 
 Man, the flag was lowered 
 So my wood was raised 
 Followed a shielding of my building 
 To protect me from the blaze 
 This granted access to 
 Southern parts of her borders 
 Did you have her comin'? 
 Like the new world order 
 I caught her with the right combination 
 A good combination 
 Keepin' it in her hard, man 
 You betta listen 
 (Listen all you fellas, here's what good love is)

 It's that brown man from long islandin' shores 
 Got a way with women, so I get away with yours 
 Because you're whole game's outdated 
 Which leaves all the pretty women heavily sedated 
 Mummy you can play your ripley's 
 Or believe it or not 
 I shoot gift like heron 
 With skills of gil-scott 
 Nights like sir lancelot can get heated 
 Prescribin' your vibe, love, 
 I know how you need it 
 I like to mingle sometimes 
 So I head out of state to find a couple of dimes 
 But a government rate can't settle for no nickels 
 Even pennies for thought for short 
 I need connections 
 With big bank selections 
 Securing all the sections 
 With sing-sing corrections 
 Seedin' like nature, escapin' like gas 
 Tell me how long this love is gonna last 
 Thinkin' fast might spoil somethin' 
 Turn a (?) to nothin' 
 (?) To your lady is special 
 Seen a bigger picture on the screen 
 But you're a movie, you move me 
 You soothe me like holidays, getaways 
 The brochure said do it 
 So true 
 It's not a hold hand mission 
 Cut the public display 
 Heard you're headed for the stars 
 Put the gazers away 
 Mine times out of ten 
 We cut to good friends 
 But when we on the tenth 
 We gotta go the length 
 I'm not a playa 
 Yet I get more play 
 Than a talk show shown 
 Cross the USA 
 Have em' moanin' out the vowels sounds 
 Ooh, eeii, and ah 
 And how by now you should know me and my crew members 
 Do members of the opposite sex 
 Have their boyfriend screaming out 
 We got more techs 
 Than that ball team in georgia 
 (Yo, he said he's comin' for ya) 
 All because the ho wanna go to the casbah 
 You can get with 
 Some of these women 
 Some of the time 
 When your face is in the light 
 (?) Stirred with lime 
 Is it a crime 
 To set your mind to death? 
 Resuscitated 
 See how many brain cells left 
 I feel your body's drawn to my positive 
 Don't even want a baby 
 If it's that easy to give 
 I live right around the corner 
 Three states away 
 Take a holiday 
 Come check me 
 Watch how I set the 
 Mood, check a movie on the tube 
 Get your belt mad loose like lee 
 Phone's turned way down 
 To avoid the beef 
 Or the questions 
 If she's the only one gettin' lessons 
 You're into crime faces, huh? 
 Well I'll play your capone 
 Suzy q got the grill 
 To make the cake chrome 
 Situation's gettin' absurd 
 Hot on a plat 
 So work the format 
 See how we do that? 
 And you're figurin 
 We love on the rock 
 I'ma keep it up front 
 To maintain the stock 
 Displayin all the goodies 
 From your knuckle to knees 
 Make it hot like the island degrees 
 Now that's special"

 Ha! Ha ha ha ha 
 Ah-ha ha ha, ah-ha ha ha ha, ha! 
 Intro/Chorus: De La + Mos Def 
 Now this goes out to all area clicks 
 Centralized and way out in the sticks 
 Remember to keep the De La/De La/Native Tongue 
 In the mix 
 Just like log cabin syrup my sound is game thick 
 Now this goes out to all area clicks 
 From manicured lawns to projects bricks/bricks/from 718 to the 51-6 
 Remember to keep the Mos Def/Native Tongue 
 In the mix 
 Straight butter hits, drop as a good as it gets/gets/straight butter hits 
 Verse One: Mos Def, Dove, Posdonus 
 Now, come on y'all, get live get down 
 What we have is a brand new sound 
 So don't none of y'all just be misled 
 The De La's gonna do the body good like wheat bread 
 Shakin laces out of shoes, Mos Def bought the brews 
 Sittin' Indian squats to make that red tie knots 
 See I'm out to get the core like in them Rainbow Pops 
 Swingin' life like a hammock, invested like stocks 
 Via sinus complex, I aims to clog it up 
 Snappin by the pain as a crew hear the gain 
 We remain on your mind like skulls, not a golem 
 I'ma show it in the house all perimeters are blown 
 Native Tongue come through to make you say yes yes 
 This is the body Mos Def style fresh like baby breath 
 We are the killer combination with the size to administer 
 The beatdown to swell up all three of your eyes 
 Now check it out, and ya don't stop 
 We got the big brother beat, ya don't stop 
 Verse Two: Mos Def, Posdonus, Dove 
 I don't bug out I chill, don't be actin' ill 
 No trick in ninety-six, Native Tongue gon build 
 But we be easy on the cut, no mistakes allowed 
 Cause to me, MC mean, make it clean 
 When I speak on groups and I'm smooth like gabba D 
 Tryin' to hang out with Dove and catch love in Aberdine (word up) 
 I bag dimes like my man born on August 17 
 Life be nuttin but a river son I'm swimmin upstream 
 Playin' wait up, with the data servin' your ears 
 With information due to confirmation of the nation's most 
 Wicked ways of livin', like them glassy eyed beans 
 Inhale to smoke the fiends, while bangin' a table 
 Rated at the high point of the mass 
 Rippin MC's at the top of a class, occasionally 
 Rippin some sucker's face 
 Or some suckable ass from a girl 
 It's a big brother beat for the wide wide world 
 I'm makin' memos off these demos back in eighty-nine 
 Took you all on encounters of an unknown kind (right) 
 Did the hustle with a couple of us, but soon noted 
 That my niggaz buttered Benedict rolls, and then voted 
 I wrote in the dark so I could feel it like braille (uh-huh) 
 Heard the big brother beat, got locked with no bail 
 Came to set like equators invented, with the heat 
 Yo Mos Def how you radiate to make it complete 
 RIGHT *echoes*, so when I shine the light crabs wince 
 Manifestin for the future here in the present tense 
 No doubt, I love the sound biggin out off your Jeeps 
 Son I want the little kids bangin' big brother beats 
 We straight butter hits, we straight butter hits 
 Manteca, manteta 
 Mantequilla

84,De La Soul,hiphop,Down Syndrome,"(Pos) 
 I be that mind blessin blessin these lessons we've ignited 
 Want to bring it to my face man you're cordially invited 
 'Cause I've cited, you possess no science in your thinking 
 So I'm gonna (never) you're blinking! 
 (Dove) 
 Fingers be pointin, and leakin falsifyin the stink 
 You think I'm pink I bl-l-link with them shades of thought and think 
 (And in this corner be the hush) so play on William Rhodes 
 Cause at the sound of the bell my circle square controls 
 And all MC's best sweat, we bringin' buckets of heat 
 (Pos) 
 So don't fret kid I let you lick the love I secrete, yo 
 Even my foes give me bravos, and that shows 
 Total domination in this rhyme complication 
 (Dove) 
 Yeah the skill is a cinch I rock the womb with a mic 
 And in the days of the nickel and breast, I knew de yes yes y'allin 
 Was the callin, clearly not for the gat 
 For combat, I bring a bag of my rhymes for the SAT 
 (Pos) 
 I'm Plug One-of-a-kind, for you people's delight 
 And for you sucker MC's, step to your knees 
 Ain't no second thoughts and all your thoughts are from Orion 
 I can tell that you a devil by them rhymes you're designin 
 Your play doggin tactics can't fuck with my facets 
 Just because you talk all that glock shit don't mean you can rock shit! 
 Your identities on freeze 
 Just a form of protozoa tryin' to cross them seas 
 (Dove) 
 See high horse riders gettin' shot by the sheriff 
 Cause nobody's safe for crimes 
 And even all you skirts need to checkin' in your upstairs attic 
 Cause Mase is smackin hoes if hoes is startin static 
 (Pos) 
 Now it ain't all good when your jam goes wood 
 So as a deterrant, I use mental current 
 Got them brothers shook, peep the look comin' out of the face 
 'Cause they all catch a bruise from the hits we make 
 Your fame and cars should be listed as magnets 
 Legends never die but they can get shot and killed 
 Ain't nuttin glitter when you're battlin MC's 
 You once imitated in a mirror so to down syndrome you kneel 
 (Dove) 
 The same status I heard, the same nothin' 
 My ears fears the faulty locks tryin' to lock down the stops 
 But I earn more than your Menudo or your Boyz II Men 
 While down syndrome keeps you immune to frequencies I send 
 Fresher than a sniff off havin' them J in fifth 
 I identify with your rhythm 
 But I exist for more than just a Benz, so mends 
 I'm cuttin' off my friends to keep a smile calicum iron grain 
 (Pos) 
 Let me tell you a little something about Soul (tell 'em son) 
 I be a piece of the East coast, so give a toast to 
 Plug Wonder why back in the day who soaked his words in jigga 
 So when I ran a phrase in June you didn't catch it till December 
 I'm a member of them kids from the inner city 
 Giving you kitties audible treats, you be aching for making 
 More money than a pagan holiday 
 Not from the PJ's, yet I still got something to say 
 (Dove) 
 Say what man? You gritty like a diamond grenade 
 For the cameo spot you tries to fool Parade 
 You acrobats flip the star gazin map, for alla that 
 You'll be the first to place, and ran it all to a waste 
 And all the style that you bring (gotta make decks bend) 
 You gotta rip it from the start (when the beats come in!)"

 I'ma stand up for art express, do mic test rehearsals 
 Eight years of man livin', ain't no edits or commercials 
 Flick the God like mummy, but my own want a debit 
 Tossin facts and how they axis don't, spin on a limit 
 Ain't no need to dwell, to health I'm fakin your jax 
 Ride niggaz get to sittin' to rear, so play the Parks of Rosa 
 Suppose I have my whole life on it 
 Funny how those you love love the evil they do 
 I brew the medicine to heal, a bit of verbals we had 
 But yo' ideas of heal, is left the surface of it scabbed 
 Navigations nearly took me on some cruise type expense 
 Dispensin me some shitty canal, I took the juice 
 Because I'm used to one-ways, detours and destinations 
 Of ways in life, I pretends the knife 
 Stuck in my spine'll be a symbol, how Jack can B. Nimble 
 But it's time to make that foggy vision crystal 
 We gots to get the crystal right?

 Well I don't wanna go that far 
 To sell my soul, I ain't gonna go that far 
 I'm takin' minds and hearts beyond the shinin star 
 Raw dick, honey I don't wanna go that far 
 So listen why you riskin your mentality against mine? 
 Sick of leadin love 
 Sick of leadin love, leavin' love loudfaced 
 In the vehicle of mine 
 Them wanna do awards, ? nine ninety-nine, watch em 
 Profile the true fall out for so-called friends 
 Like mercury and water, we just don't blend

 True gems show affection like Jody Watley, so...

 (Posdonus) 
 I recall kissin' on my lady, talkin' bout makin' babies 
 Now we made the baby, but cannot connect as legal spouses 
 Now me and my daughter reside in different houses 
 What louses up the structure, is leavin' things up to 
 The child lesser, than a child runnin' wild from mild pressure 
 Mega... (mega..) nega... (nega..) tive 
 To live a master plan when that plan has no master 
 You stare at false tongues, leadin the yung'un to disaster 
 Postures of this world is seen as mad crooked 
 Want your manhood, but man, your dad took it 
 We used to swallow 40's and a whole lot of pride 
 Nice MC's be frontin on some whole other vibe 
 Just because them albums are sealed, doesn't mean 
 Them lyrics are untampered with, let's kill the myth 
 That as MC's we know it all, we all children still 
 No tricks for ninety-six, it's due time we build man...

 Yes, stop gassin me, stop gassin me

 The instamatic focal point bringing damage to your boroughs 
 Be some brothers from the east with some beats that be thorough 
 Got the solar gravitation so I'm bound to pull it 
 I gets down like brothers are found ducking from bullets 
 Gun control means using both hands in my land 
 Where it's all about the cautious livin' 
 Migrating to a higher form of consequence, compliments 
 Of strugglin', that shouldn't be notable, 
 Man every word I say should be a hip hop quotable. 
 DOVE: 
 I'm sick of bitches shakin' asses 
 I'm sick of talkin' about blunts, 
 Sick of Versace glasses, 
 Sick of slang, 
 Sick of half-ass awards shows, 
 Sick of name brand clothes. 
 Sick of R&B bitches over bullshit tracks, 
 Cocaine and crack 
 Which brings sickness to blacks, 
 Sick of swoll' head rappers

 Clappers and gats 
 Makin' the whole sick world collapse

 Yo, it's about love for cars, love for funds 
 Loving to love mad sex, loving to love guns 
 Love for opposite, love for fame and wealth 
 Love for the fact of no longer loving yourself, kid 
 We living in them days of the man-made ways 
 Where every aspect is vivid, 
 These brothers no longer talk shit 
 Hey yo, these niggas live it 
 'Bout to give it to you 24/7 on the microphone

 And niggas dying for it nowadays ain't odd

 Showing out in videos, saying they cold stars

 Positive contact just like my main man 
 Who got others cleaning up his physical influence 
 His mind got congested

 Just animals surviving with that animal behavior 
 Under I who be rhyming from dark to light sky 
 Experiments when needles and skin connect 
 No wonder where we live is called the projects 
 When them stakes is high you damn sure try to do 
 Anything to get the piece of the pie

 Even die for the cash

 You are about to build witness 
 From the lands of Long Island 
 Takin' you to the sky's survival 
 I am your captain, ain't no lie

 To where you never been before 
 It's just a one night trip to love 
 Sun shinin' forever, and forever sun shines

 Yo, leaving lasting impressions like cuts to flesh 
 Be that crew from the five one six point of view 
 With skills so tight, they the rhymes of a vigina

 Pressure comes from lessor forms than me and my man 
 And we go back like life created from um, specks of sand 
 And there's money to be made 'cause cacaussians are paid 
 Only brothers who rhyme, seek bounce and catch balls 
 Plug 1, with them rhymes makin' your heart stall 
 Like them girls when you in they room when they man calls 
 It ain't nothin' but the thing Oneder Why can bring 
 As we come to the bring the pain everyone will sing 
 De La is the crew that you must hear, but please don't rush the stage 
 'Cause even though them stakes are really high, we're really not here to race 
 We're just here to move your mind and soul with propetuated ease 
 It's just about the show until it's time to go, and get with the young ladies

 I'm on travellin' to places that the eye can't see 
 But kinder, cause yo' strife don't mean a thing to me 
 Throwin' me criminal looks, y'all need to get in the books 
 And drop some water in your melon, 'stead of actin' like a felon 
 Aiyo son, who you tellin'? I'd make a mil if it was up to me 
 But since it ain't I teach my seed to bank hard 
 And than God, I smoke a substance of a different kind 
 Catch me trippin' on earth when I'm high off sunshine

 Down right to dirt, Oneder Why makes it work 
 With access to talent like cacaussins to yellow cabs 
 With an Arab driver 
 I liven parties with marvelous confiction 
 Ain't no fricition when life claims them victims who be ??? some dried up 
 Funds 
 Best believe that the life is trife 
 'Casue the gun made a man outta pussy's from around my way 
 Who usually wouldn't have a fuckin' thing to say 
 Last year's hard rocks are now petrified boulders 
 And L.I.'s finest is movin' yo' necks at shows 
 The anthem of ths guy has a place in yo' eye 
 So you can be blessed to see in 3d double-e"

 To do what I like

 It's been about ten long years, my skin wreaks 
 Flavors that your incense couldn't match 
 We burn slow like syphillis in your piss, accommodated 
 With the penicill-in, you're listenin', to 
 This ""Art Official"" will keep your shoes moonwalkin' 
 Soon to talk about, ""Pop Music"" 
 You'll buy it cause you choose it 
 A lot of MC's is really S&M'n 
 Whips and chains, I maintain like a old jazz singer 
 Elephants in any location 
 Held back in rotation, an apple a day 
 Only makes a nigga fruity 
 I eat responsibilities to carry out my duty

 Make notes if you earnin' or wait your turnbuckle 
 I stick to gettin' mines like stucco, stucco (ah, ah)

 I'm that full-time rapper, the nickname's Llama 
 Part-time father if you ask my daughter's mommas 
 Missin' in action cause the action got a fraction

 Got a sea of hands wavin', ain't misbehavin' 
 But a lot of kids cravin' for somethin' they ain't got 
 Like the keys to the ride and a pocket with a knot in it 
 Holdin' they ground till they rot in it 
 Plottin it, lockin it down strong 
 'Cause it's nuttin wrong gettin' your bubblin on sticker 
 But too much bubblin can make you fizz quicker 
 So watch your stack, keep your fam intact 
 And pay attention to the now, I'm clearin the mess 
 While they stressin back in the day, I'm at the front of the night 
 With my crew shinin light on the (ah, ah)

 Now we on top of this like a typical bed position 
 Peepin your view, got your whole crew wishin and waitin

 In my pieces I pen the good livin' 
 And even when we're stressin from in the hood livin' 
 At least we're livin' and there ain't no hell in that 
 Give me a yell in that, and go (ah, ah)

 I wanna see the world ten times over 
 Dive off cliffs and land on oppotunities unthinkable 
 You sinkin straight to the bottom; while I float in parades 
 That St. Patty couldn't put up 
 All my niggaz tryin' to build, then throw your wood up 
 Design life like PNB gears so stand clear for the blast off 
 Last off my chest, peace to Dav West 
 Live your life to the fullest (ah, ah)

 Love money like I love my moms 
 Love my nigga Com Sense when he bang dents all up in they wallets 
 Wall to wall bullshit I got hardwood floors 
 Set sail for tour ever since eighty-nine 
 So y'all are fuckin' the same hoes who used to be mine

 And I've been waitin three summers to rhyme longside my people 
 Rico, De La, inject you with the lethal 
 Dose of hop-hippin if you thought CaTash was slippin 
 Then put that drink down, you drunk off what you sippin 
 CaTash put the dip in dip dive socialize 
 Fuck around with me and next you'll find yo' crib burglarized

 Hand over fist - how can a man act like a bitch? 
 Change and switch, snitch on his crew 
 Yo get rid of the niggaz before the same thing happen to you

 And they'll leave your ass sticky like glue

 Got a nigga duckin while them girls show fright 
 What you know about my writes? (my writes) 
 Ah what you know about my writes? (my writes)

 Yeah, yeah, look 
 I'm Samson without Delilah, the soul survivor 
 The drunk driver that rolls straight, take the whole cake 
 Chop it up with the family, wash it down with alcohol 
 My telly's a Desert Eagle for all the fuckin' shots I called 
 My niggaz gotta ball, never settle for less 
 Heavy metal, heavy on yo' chest like two breasts 
 Step into my office 'cause it's time for you to roll somethin' 
 One false move, and we gon' beat you like you stole somethin'

 Yo these style I kick should be called ?? rap 
 Drawin the pussy out the nigga after my prize, 'cause I want it 
 They stomach what I throw, they know I'm right for they diet 
 They librarian flow keeps the party real quiet (shhhhh) 
 The love I lost outweighs the rhymes I gain 
 But the fact that I spit 'em makes me cherish the name 
 So pass the mic so I can put in my share 
 I rip it from home to L.A. 
 With connectin flights to rip it elsewhere

 Drinkin' up Black and Tan in the back of a van 
 I learned as a young man - long trip, piss in a can 
 Gettin' a house for two grand, now you got your own land 
 Let your mind expand, everyday have a plan 
 Ro-Gram is rare earth, swingin' Black Tarzan 
 You got to live with the cards dealt in yo' hand 
 Stay young like Peter Pan, like Sly, take a Stand 
 And go Uptown Saturday Night like Ichiban

 I keep it dirty like under the bed (dirty) 
 Dirty like Uncle Red; aiyyo, (??) (??) 
 Dirty brown Likwit flow thicker than the Yoo-Hoo 
 Dirt you dishin out, chef tellin' it all 
 Face down in the dirt, doin' my dirty work 
 Expert, tryin' to regulate my network 
 Head jerk, spice it with rice, stick with it 
 If they ask who cut the grits I'ma say E-Swift did it

 Tash'll punch you in your grill and leave ""Potholes in Yo' Lawn"" 
 (C'mon!) You makin' diss songs? Spit that rhyme my way 
 I can shut y'all niggaz down like the Y-2-K 
 I did a tour in ninety-four with De La Soul and Tribe 
 We on the same vibe, cause real niggaz coincide 
 (""Right-right-right.."") The situation is drastic 
 But see songs like these is why this album goin' classic 
 (J-Ro) 
 This is for the DJ, bring it back one time 
 I drop bombs like when my moms told me to rhyme 
 I'm - old school like my dad is 
 So add this, to your collect', Plug Won - who the baddest? 
 (Pos) 
 Aiyyo we theme park status, upstage these niggaz like Gladys 
 Them little Pips, they done tripped the wire 
 Blamin they legs, while I'm claimin these tunes 
 In this we'll stay down like seats found in sorority bathrooms 
 (Xzibit) 
 Yeah - we flat out classic, separate the real from the plastic 
 And I gotta say no names 
 Play no games, hit the switches, crack the frame 
 Show no shame or fuck it all up, take the blame 
 Brand name fresh out the box type hustle 
 Manpower success is mind over muscle 
 Grind till the wheels fall off, accept the loss 
 I never been soft, whatever the cost, addicted to floss 
 Nailed to the cross it's time to return 
 My only concern is makin' sure that Hollywood burn, 
 Hollywood burn, burn to the ground, trick-ass niggaz 
 Is all up in the game and don't deserve to be down 
 (J-Ro) 
 Four bottle rap, twist the cap and kick back 
 De La, Xzibit and Tha Liks came to get that 
 And what you know about us droppin' ya 
 And leavin' you with half a face like the Phantom of the Opera? 
 Chorus w/ minor variations 
 (Chorus extended) 
 Ah what you know about my writes? (my writes) 
 Ah what you know about my writes? (my writes)

 You got the right to shut the fuck up! {*laughing*}"

 And when it comes to rhymes... (Brick City)

 Yo, don't scandalize mine 
 I spent too much time 
 Straight talk with the catch to etch my line walk 
 Never fetchin for crime, halt! Who goes there?

 Yo, it's the squeeze of five fingers, puffin Smokey the Bear 
 Shinin black like Darth Vader caps, they on stare 
 (Pos) 
 While we rockin' it, I'll rock in it (rock in it) 
 Like the little ball inside the spray can 
 Providing three coats for both child, woman and man 
 Chorus One: Redman 
 God bless the God, lay these Streets Wall to Wall 
 It go - ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh! 
 Yo, you got popped like a flick by that rivalry click 
 It went - ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh! 
 (Pos) 
 It ain't my fault your ass is on the ashphalt 
 Got your chin touched by my fam who though you brought harm, you see 
 I'm iced out like a glass of tea 
 Better yet, oatmeal cookies, y'all just rookies to me 
 Slidin' up and down the court, but I don't think you can D 
 Why try? Maseo be gettin' high since Luke was Luke Skywalk' 
 Man, my topic of talk is sheddin shame all over your game 
 Like them shorties who claim that afrocentric lovin' is the past drug 
 A life filled with (*TWEET*) that's what thugs love 
 Snatch you fast, wrap that ass in the rug of your choice 
 While it muffles your voice 
 (Dove) 
 Now when I'm swimmin through the joint, I put the funk on hold 
 'Cause if you don't, you'll see the bubbles come up 
 We run up a tab and gladly add a little extra for miss 
 Flashy faces with bigger lips for that ass to kiss 
 (Pos) 
 Most crews are post-current while we're forever 
 Direct beats that's contagious, loved by all ages 
 Graduated from the you-and-I-versity 
 Of hard-hitters, for real 
 Chorus Two: Redman 
 I got niggas in the streets that'll blast your ass for the shine 
 And get - ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh! 
 Yo, if you a fat chick gettin' your fuck on tonight 
 Then go - ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh! 
 Yo, put your hands opposite to the ground if you're lovin' our sound 
 Go - ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh! 
 Yo, and to my broke niggaz on the corner holdin' me down 
 Go - ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh! 
 (Dove) 
 Yo, I swear Tommy gonna get it, he done did me wrong 
 I had plans to buy more land, plant corn 
 Bust kernels on heat, work hard like wetbacks 
 Set backs is gonna get my ass to be hostile 
 Rockwilder the beat, top dollar defeat 
 Big money's make the big decisions 
 Keep hip-hop alive, it's just an intermission 
 Back to the second half of the feature flick 
 Dick stacks and fuck rap 
 (Pos) 
 I had a name for makin' paper since paper mache 
 Now my dollar coins join pounds of yen for play 
 While you broke niggaz reach drunk much quicker 
 You don't make enough bread to soak up all your liquor 
 Went from God to God damn 
 (Redman) 
 Damn God, you're killin' it 
 Should incorporate it, invest half a mil' in it 
 Rap cats talk with no will in it 
 (Pos) 
 Soundin like they virtual 
 This joint'll hurt you, yo 
 (Dove) 
 Twas the night before Christmas and my crib got robbed 
 (Shhh shhh shh, shhhhh) They did a job 
 Took all my goodies out from under the tree, except the CD's 
 Of shiny-suit rappers and flossin emcees 
 Who fail at takin' it to rhyme degrees 
 (Pos) 
 Man, you know no wack poems get no play in our homes 
 You need to not get nappy with me 
 Or else we gon' ""relax your mind, let your conscious be free"" 
 Chorus Three: Redman 
 Yo, where my Wall Street niggaz, if ya up in the stands 
 Go - ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh! 
 To my women that'll throw they hands against they punk-ass man 
 Go - ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh! 
 Yo, if you never been shot or stabbed 
 Brick City go - ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh! 
 Yo, I gotta catch a cab back to the lab so I can smoke

 I ain't no thug son, my name is Plug Won 
 I drop a certified gem, for him and her 
 Knockin' on your radio, like the Crash Crew 
 Ask whoever you want - I'm managin the funk on the paper 
 Outside of that we pull capers for days 
 Ridin' throughout the maze of street, while we blaze the beat 
 Watchin the sweet things wiggle they butt 
 To Plug Three, on the cut, movin on ya what- 
 -Ever ya got, we gon' get, bringin' our point, to ya position 
 Rippin stages with my thought coalition 
 Carryin on, eradicate all your stress mode

 And like a train, we be runnin' throughout your legs and arms 
 You're high off our talent and charm 
 Check the caliber - this be a smash 
 Like some food on stage for Gallagher 
 Wear ya bib, 'cause it's messy 
 Niggaz schemin on my +Girl+ as if my name was +Jesse+ 
 Watch your manners! Now let me pass it off to Dave Banner 
 (Dove) 
 Yo, I set travels like Karen LaRue 
 Small talkin' in the big city, it's all about gettin' the coins 
 Everywhere I go I touch a tenderloin 
 They sportin a dot com Viet marker bomb 
 On your metro - MARTA order iron horse 
 Yo take the cross and meet a nigga at the butcher 
 I'm cuttin' your girl - we on a world tour 
 Supplyin your bloodstream with nothin' but the pure uncut, in ya

 Hot times, runnin' through ya city

 We ain't walkin' on a yellow brick road 
 These streets stay red and bloody kid 
 Study your code, so you can easily pass 
 I stash a little love when I'm on the visitation 
 If you crossin my lane, nigga do the same 
 I guaranteed to run through and prove the game 
 Ain't bigger than the pieces in it 
 You see the pieces in it had me stuck travellin one side of map 
 Clappin hands with rap cats who ain't deserve dap 
 Long hauls and livin' out a suitcase man 
 Chickenheads and gangs of fruitcakes man 
 Ain't nuttin better than explorin the outskirts 
 Especially when she ain't got no pantyhose on, and it's on

 It's the one and only effect, that you catch from a cassette 
 Straight wig out the world and girls we straight dig out ya back 
 With letters spellin out my name 
 All over your marquee, cause the spark is me 
 Currently we can be seen across your screen 
 Stayin wide-eyed cause you niggaz tryin' to scheme 
 Welcome to the spot - I'm slaying with it 
 Chop it up and fit it inside your quart of rice 
 You speak ghetto falsetto on the mic device 
 Tryin' to give me third degree, you just a third of me 
 Couldn't be the shit if you were a turd of me 
 A man tight with my funds, crush like Ricky D 
 Who quoted Vance Wright - no one can serve us! 
 My squad advance heights quite superb 
 Just kick off your shoes - jump on the jock 
 It's been a long time comin' this you NEED to cop!

 It goes one (one) two (two) three (three) four (four) 
 Bounce so much I ricochet up off the floor (floor) 
 So raw shit the most raw you ever saw 
 Quarter after four, niggaz quick to bust the back door 
 Baby - open your blouse while I joust another nigga's spouse 
 Quick Jamaican dick style all in they house 
 I practice to be the all access, you see the fact is 
 My mouth dirty, so follow while I display the slackness 
 Yo, you see my slang talk straight from the slums 
 When I was young, moms put soap on my tongue, and yo-yo 
 Forever we gettin' this CHEDDAR with the quickness 
 While I cast the spell on these bitches, you can be my eyewitness 
 Short fuse, nowadays Langston Hughes 
 We gettin' money with whoever - even the Jews 
 The way we finagle and gain it must be all in my shoes 
 Fuck a nigga up with De La like (?) can amuse"

 Pin us up or mantle it 
 We on fire you candle lit 
 Daydreamin, on a rack 
 Get bought worn and brought back 
 We sport rhyme thought real tight

 To gain sizes much bigger 
 Life life well, get mail filled with 
 Checks from sales we deliver

 Spend a little, make a little 
 I want it big like white boy wallets

 Fertilize my brain data 
 Makin' accounts grow green like the front lawns

 No lyin', straight shinin

 You got limbs so climb in

 If you ask Mercenary bout this shit, it pays 
 Hitting Willie Mays style out the park 
 Mastering in this +Art+ that's +Official+ 
 Your ears absorb this like tears, on a tissue 
 Cause my thoughts are dollar bill crisp 
 Distinct like E-Double's lisp 
 L.I. alumni, wonder why I got it 
 Got it? Get a piece 
 Got product that you all should own and not lease 
 Some say drummers play synonymous with ill 
 With wordplay, that keep us all paid like a bill 
 We're the parent company 
 You the sub in my D-I-vision 
 You don't know how... {*words fade out*}"

 La-la-la-la-ladies first and all that

 So peep it - you see this girl 
 Who been poppin' MAD shit about you 
 So I want you to get into it a little bit 
 I want you to cru-cru-cru-crush that ?? 
 (Indeed) 
 I was sittin' on my lunchbreak, grittin my teeth 
 It's the last day of the week, man what a relief 
 My arms are sore as hell, I felt rigid and stiff 
 So I turned around and I rolled this big fat spliff 
 That's when I seen her, steppin out a rented yellow Beemer 
 This local ghetto fame rap cat her name was Tina 
 She was braggin she was goin' on tour 
 The same shit she was screamin since the year before 
 Ever since the De La Soul video, she seen me on the TV 
 Heard that she was holdin' a grudge and tryin' to see me 
 Workin underground circuits and mad cyphers of people 
 When she asked who was ill, all she got was Indeed 
 She wanna battle (what?) and it wasn't hard to tell 
 All that I was thinkin' bout was tryin' to smoke my L 
 I had four hours left and I was tired as hell 
 Plus it was 12:55 almost time for the bell 
 She had an ill screwface mug, frontin like she know Joe 
 Gangsta bitch profile, boppin like allegro 
 Forty-below Timbos, fatigues saggin 
 Pullin all her money out her pocket while she's braggin 
 On her gold fronts with her name on it 
 Her ice finger roll hand g-low while she claim fame on it 
 I peeped the stee' - then I crushed her with ease 
 Just for interruptin me while I was rollin' my trees 
 AIGHT? (Whoo!) 
 That shit was bla-bla-bla, bla-blaze! (word) 
 Now we gon' se-se-set, se-set this one up 
 For my man Mercenary (aight aight yo let's do this) 
 (Whassup?) Yo, I don't want you to make it like 
 A story or nuttin (aight) 
 I just want-want, want want-want 
 Want you to come on some straight rhy-rhy-rhyme 
 Rhy-rhy, rhy-rhme shit - rip a nigga in his ass! 
 And let him know how WE do it, y-y-y'know?

 Now Maseo puff cheeba, while Rich sniff lines 
 David J push the whip while Candy Cal pull dimes 
 And me right behind, with the shorty gettin' her math 
 To do the Savion routine and just, tap that ass 
 Still the one who kill wackness, man I left them niggaz crippled 
 Had 'em all soft to hard back to soft like a nipple 
 My +Art is Official+ while you're art-ificial 
 Break you down to your very last participle 
 Let me enlighten you, cause your third eye's on dim 
 Me gettin' taken out is rare like a smile from Rakim 
 See I'm remarkable, you're just bull 
 Last name shit, y'all niggaz need to quit 
 Open your mitt, and catch this 
 I autograph every word you bit 
 ??Testify then?? take your picture 
 Got an infinity of non-rhymes to hit ya 
 While your whole clan is blam 
 Understand that you must be smokin' POUNDS of weed out of a pipe 
 And mistook your munchies, for bein hungry for the mic 
 And now you have to deal with these cats who's truly right 
 Like estates with a pit on the lawn bark at the gates 
 Put the whole entire plate in your face 
 Make the point like who's that on that joint? It's me 
 I'm in everything you see like ??, yo I'm in demand 
 I'm in the club man I'm in your hand 
 Bein bought, I'm even in the thought from your girl 
 The only thing you're in is in acting 
 Your world'll be smashed 
 Run against the Won and you'll be last 
 Like that call for alcohol, depletin your cash 
 That's how you supposed to get in somebody ass

 It ain't all good, and that's the truth 
 Thangs ain't goin' like you think they should - it's all on you 
 (Chaka Khan) 
 I don't care about what you think you see 
 The thangs you want to know when you look at me 
 God knows I done been through and paid my dues 
 Can't change how you feel, 'cause it's - all on you-whoahhha-oh-yeah 
 I wish that, you could be a little bit more upfront 
 Weigh the situation how you want (right) 
 The lovin' that you claim is just a four letter word 
 The third letter's invitin so visualize the verb 
 You curve thoughtways when you're handlin the candleabra 
 So you sittin' on the baby grand 
 Transmittin like you're made of man 
 But you paint a funny face like a chick 
 When I see you I'ma tell you quick that uh... 
 I can't believe we built this large pizza pie together 
 No pepperoni 
 Yeah you wanted extra cheese, sometimes I gave you extras 
 How we divided slices like the Red Sea theory 
 I was Moses hopelessly scorned by your thorn zapora 
 Tried to bring that fairy-tale life, you wanted horror 
 But my microscope couldn't see or cope with that 
 I had to bolt from that, and left you dead in the sea 
 It's better for me, I'm satisfied with reppin for D 
 We were certified hot, then dropped to lukewarm 
 Now we back up in the spot, claimin never been gone 
 Niggaz who cut us off, wanna reattach us now 
 (Them girls who brushed us off, say they want some #'s to dial) 
 Yeah I give that ass a number, and some lumber to pile 
 Now catch a curve from my kick (or show me lovin' by brick) 
 So stick to the same plan, don't come shakin my hand 
 Like we peeps, it ain't beef but be sure to understand 
 Between us, it ain't all... 
 You see them kids be schemin on what we done copped 
 Always out there schemin! 
 They steady fiendin for the moment they can get us off the block 
 Why they always fiendin? 
 Your people might have your back, but you need to watch your front 
 Indeed, ain't nothin' guaranteed 
 That's the truth! Things ain't goin' like you think they should 
 A lot say they wanna walk in my size 10's 
 Aight then; here's a pair 
 Lace 'em up tight then you might feel what was dealt to me 
 You see ain't no young boys up in here; keep a clear head 
 Tryin' to keep my pockets on stuffed - like deer heads 
 Upon the wall, so all the gall we get from y'all DON'T FAZE 
 So mind your biz and walk away 
 'Cause I'm never gonna let you up inside my maze 
 I don't care about what you think you see 
 The thangs you want to know when you look at me 
 God knows I done been there and paid my dues 
 I can't change how you feel, 'cause it's all, on you-whoahhha-oh

 Playin' host to your regiment 
 Who rally to boast, but now boast no more 
 They got floored by the sight of my ledger print 
 I came specifically, to fracture yo' ability 
 To grandstand anywhere next to me 
 This is the year, when the true better man 
 Keeps the cheddar and writes to his destiny (word!)

 With a whole lot of shootin while you're keepin' out of sniper range 
 Your aim's to please, my aim's to freeze 
 You dead center in your tracks with your hands high 
 Ain't no tricks, we set it to fire like Hendrix 
 All the hard rocks at liquor spots 
 All over the scene, makin' it messy 
 So we make a clean getaway to a better day 
 Can't say the same, for them cats who left the game 
 'Cause they couldn't claim the better pay 
 This ain't no masquerade 
 So the mass parade of people need to stop frontin 
 There's truly a few makin' them hits 
 While us, we got our mitts closed cause you on the field buntin 
 Make it to third bass, but never reach home 
 The word is, your whereabouts is unknown 
 While we're that point of view, that you never really knew

 Stayin true to this vision in the Y2G

 Two G's got 'em scratchin it like the fleas 
 And Ad Rock got it locked like a crooked cop

 Noooooowww; it's Ad Rock, y'all remember me 
 The guy ya bit ya style from off the TV 
 (Pos) 
 I score Mmmma-Zah-Ay's all day, my essays are felt worldwide 
 We like four planets on the mic 
 Aligned arrays retired all in the days 
 Game (baby-baby) too blam for these lames 
 (Ad Rock) 
 When I was nine, I played with slime 
 Got rhymes ga-lot, got rhymes ga-limes 
 I got a million like rhymes leavin' ya stung 
 I got my own crew called the nasal tongue! 
 (Dove) 
 Yo take a few of these b-boys and call me in the mornin (okay) 
 Keep it on the crusty eye, bagel with some butterflies 
 Spit gritty like we in MCA's voice box 
 Y'all bull and my ox don't fit the mix 
 (Disc jock!) It be some classic material kid 
 (Disc jock!) Got the calm cats blowin' their lid 
 (Disc jock!) You get plush off the rack 
 And buy plenty or more we got 'em by the stack

 Ad Rock in the house you don't stop!

 Don't mean to be crude, don't mean to be crass 
 But listen Guiliani you can kiss my ass (what?) 
 You heard my word, now Dove you play the preacher 
 Get on the mic if you love all the creatures 
 (Dove) 
 Well yeah I got these fishes swimmin round my baracuda 
 Back in '82 I used to ride a street scooter 
 Called 'em cuter than pigtails, sales you keep 'em level, and 
 Smack you with a shovel and break your lifestyle (owww!) 
 Firm on the mic since my days of a child 
 Got a ""License +TOO+ Ill"" to flash to police 
 The only beast I huddles with the Beastie Boys 
 Bringin' ""Noise"" like P.E. to your TV

 Aiyyo this beat's barefoot and knock-kneed 
 Stripped to the rhyme! 
 And every line made from scratch 
 Attached like stripes to shell-toes 
 Thin spools that hold the herb

 It's like the ooh-la-la, ooh-ooh-la-la 
 Rhymin over old breaks like the Mardis Gras 
 Party people cross and bump they go ooh and they ah 
 And Mike D and Ad Rock down with the De La

 So here's another dose for you to feel! 
 Put ya body in it! 
 Come on - SQUAT!

 I'm feelin' good, damn good, but also confused 
 This stuff from hip-hop that's bein misused 
 It's desirin, acquirin, tryin' to be like Iverson 
 If it means backstabbin and also conspirin 
 (All together) 
 Nowwww, the people in the front - you do the bump bump 
 The people in the back - they're not the whack whack 
 The people in the middle - come on and wiggle wiggle 
 And the people on the side - we can all take a ride!

 In my VW I done swung an ep' or two 
 The rear in my hatchback y'all know I scratched that 
 Here to haystack, keep it rosy in the Rolls 
 Skiddin out to place my vote at the polls for Ad Rock

 You think I lose sleep if you sleep on me?!

 From two crews spittin' for the art of it

 Ya understand what I'm sayin'? 
 Hey De La Soul, Beastie Boys 
 I love the way y'all doin' this baby

 Because the kids don't know, the other people don't know 
 But they all gon' know now because me 
 The Chief Rocker Busy Bee gon' just keep kickin flava baby! 
 Ah like this 
 Just dance, and don't quit 
 Cause the music is gonna be the shit 
 I just dance, and don't quit 
 Cause the music is gonna be the shit 
 And now once upon a time in the place to be 
 They was standin in line to see the Busy Bee 
 When I pulled up to the curb in my ninety-eight 
 I rushed inside so I won't be late 
 You know the party was packed, where you couldn't even move 
 And Busy Bee rocked, to the funky funky grooves 
 To the beat that makes you want to freak 
 Ah to the beat that gets rump out your seat 
 Ah to the beat that makes you say 
 Busy Bee, Busy Bee is in the house, ha HAH! 
 I like the way this is goin' down man 
 Ah this is just too much 
 We just gotta keep doin' this 
 Because this is how we do it 
 No static, no automatics 
 This is just how we just gon' keep kickin this flavor baby..."

 Dance with me, come on dance - with me baby 
 (Dove) 
 How you gon' tell me to mind my own biz 
 When you lookin' like somethin' I need to know about? 
 I used to go about it the wrong way, tuggin your arm when you'd pass 
 But I see you got class besides all that 
 Yeah I'm picky in my own way too 
 While the rest of these fools is lookin' to screw your brains out 
 I bling'd (?) out don't (?) wanna stand froze 
 Practicin my hello's, hey lady, how you doin' 
 Renewin these vows is like fifty steps beyond from here 
 Shit I don't even know your name yet (word) 
 Ain't sure what your character contains yet 
 But damn lady, you could be my Valentine 
 Cupid got his infrared on my chest clocked 
 Let the rest flock, they just birds anyway 
 I grow my confidence in words the Henny way - yeah, buy me a drink 
 So we can sink into that thought path... 
 (Pos) 
 Now you know you ain't right, eyein me up all night 
 Despite the fact some kid is runnin' chitta-chat in your ear 
 How the hell we get here, with me over here, and you over there 
 When we can make, such an obvious pair? 
 Why miss? Have you misread my shyness for conceit? 
 I'm peepin how you move it to the pace of the beat 
 Got my eyes on wide as they constantly collide with yours 
 Your heavenly body rushin the tide to shore 
 Your heavenly body rushin these guys to the floor 
 To find pleasure in your double digit design, 
 But these clowns look hurt 
 And as a woman's ex-nigga I'm a woman ex-pert 
 Understandin how the ovaries and all that shit work 
 Extremely dreamy, my eyes you look surprised 
 That I'm movin closer - don't be, I'm supposed to D.C. 
 Are you for real or a tease? 
 (Dove) 
 Now let that drink set in sweet, we up close and personal 
 Ain't nuttin dull about this, sharp like Swiss precision 
 (Caught you watch-in) my every move from the door 
 Teran escortin us to V.I.P., we live in D.C. 
 Shoestring dress I wanna fuck and make your hair look a mess 
 Suckin the straw huh? You know the head game 
 First place chick girl I'm all about winnin' too 
 I want my trophy life-sized in a see through

 Or is it because there's some others who handed 
 Their daughters over to the night life 
 Yes we tryin' to find a night wife to get wit

 I get the first pick, run this easily

 Around the way, we're goin' 
 But first tell all these women who ain't knowin'

 Yo... I talk no shame upon this 
 I got aim all on this to shoot and score the trout 
 Who's actin' all cute and out of position while I'm wishin 
 To get her bottom limbs arched like a grasshopper 
 Puttin' in work to make it last proper 
 Ninety percent of the time is on my mindframe 
 So I'm game to reign up to par 
 While my fam runs it cool up at the bar, I stay clearheaded 
 Lettuce enough cheese to get shredded 
 We like Navy Seals lookin' for the gold 
 Our natural appeal got them others on hold 
 Them girls dealin' with us tonight 
 Came with the large appetite and got served 
 Got nerve to think less, you can bless me and my kinfolk 
 Rushin up against my yolk-sac promote that 
 Pimp play upon how we get it on for real!

 You see you hopeless up in the spot 
 Talkin' a lot of champagne taste holdin' 40 ounce pockets 
 Switch the sprocket to gear to top of the year 
 We gon' drop it like confetti on it, get ready on it 
 Her fast ass wanna get all Andretti on it 
 Makin' my main man Poke like Trakmasterz 
 Blazin-trail, we Portland to Nor-ton 
 ""Honeymoon"" flicks don't exist in this 
 I sip a little left to twist spines together 
 Vertical hold, we gon' combine together (yeah) 
 Even if we spill the love 
 We got compliments up at the front door 
 Just tell 'em Dullah sent ya 
 Thirty minute Tae*Bo shit's how I bench ya 
 All on a Saturday night, step to life

 Scannin proper with my sight muscle 
 This rap shit, is just my night hustle 
 My J-O's to stay fearin of my G-O-D 
 Whether what may, meet me at the front door 
 See the pressure got a nigga knockin' shit off his desk 
 Cause of the stress I stack words make cats bruise they neck tissue 
 Stay pertinent to the issues 
 Cut your tag too close, display these verses tight, virtuals 
 Sort of like we supposed to, pantyhose raps you run 
 Stay (?) like black folks some (?) 
 Mostly fakin it, to make it

 I play low-key till it's time for you to know me 
 Stir my lime with light, drink it down slowly 
 Holy shit! Now look what I get 
 A whole string of party people wanna run in my mix 
 In my world they wanna fit like melanin in a tit 
 Jam tight, they ain't my fam all right? They ain't my people 
 Them niggaz screamin fam till they rank measure equal 
 Then vote, without leavin' a note, and that was all she wrote 
 Arranged produced my slang's obtuse 
 But some distort, tellin' stories like Mother-the-Goose 
 My true fam's (??) back since with Vince Mason 
 We'll draw on three, leave that body for the tracin 
 Ultimate high, like them drugs you be lacin 
 Coulda stood next to me, at the top of the key 
 But you had to play gutter, didn't want to climb 
 Now you find yourself talked about in my rhyme 
 (Dove) 
 While you fools claim corners, we gon' claim theories 
 Y'all some stickball niggaz, we the World Series 
 Been here, just pleadin the same case 
 Ever since we spaced about ""3 Feet"" 
 Pinchin your ears, inchin for years 
 But you still stuck at the mezzanine and 
 We at the penthouse level with the same old rugs 
 Same old tubs, same old tables and same faults 
 Same crew and the same old train of thought 
 Chorus: De La Soul 
 My guess you need to head West (who you foolin) 
 Thought we'd fall for your phonyness you're (only foolin) 
 Yourself, thought you were down - it takes more than a smile 
 And a couple of pounds to be crew 
 Man you bound to get your tail caught (who you foolin) 
 Spreadin yourself thin see you're (only foolin) 
 Yourself, thinkin' all you need is the wealth 
 You need to peep your whole circle out 
 (Pos) 
 Yo, since Jam Master Jay been rockin' without a band 
 And that sister k.d. lang been sexin without a man 
 We brought our ultimate plan to birth 
 Put in work for this game, it's not a game to me 
 We've been furnished the props 
 Now we out to furnish properties we own 
 That's right (so) cats might know we ain't home 
 My throne's threatened by fiends, try to do dirt 
 Play Tony Randall - have that ass cleaned 
 (Dove) 
 Unveiled I see your exhibition, y'all need to cover that 
 Fatherless styles, y'all really need to mother that 
 Same expose, different page 
 But when you see me in it it's the same old Dave 
 (Pos) 
 Y'all silly, you're just a civili', I'm a soldier 
 Troopin in this path till the death won us over 
 So if life is a party begin, to understand 
 Just like the DJ, we stayin to the end 
 Chorus: De La Soul 
 How you think you gon' get away? (who you foolin) 
 Changin faces on the regular you're (only foolin) 
 Yourself, big top status, paintin your face 
 Who you think you really gonna fool huh? 
 We watch, what we got so (who you foolin) 
 Around on my premises you're (only foolin) 
 You, into thinkin' you can break in too 
 My place, and not have to face, our position 
 Who you foolin... only foolin"

 ... On my way, to the disco 
 You know the club, Maseo was rockin' rub that night 
 Midnight to four, name at the door 
 But the whole crew I can get in as well 
 So I got on my cell, called my nigga C. Smith 
 Let this be a jam that we need not miss 
 ""Yeah I'm already en route,"" no doubt 
 Might even jump up on the mic 
 To make sure that this party's turned out 
 And we some punctual types, on time, look for the line 
 To stand we find girls screamin the blues 
 Miscellaneous shoes everywhere 
 ""Yo Mase, what happened here?"" 
 (""Go Brooklyn!"") Yo Brooklyn, y'all know the rules 
 Bump ?? people and out come the tools 
 Ain't been a fair fight since the creation of crews 
 And that's why them dudes hearts all pumped 
 Done closed the club down, 
 Cause one of they niggaz got jumped 
 ** Jump, jump, jump to it! ** 
 Uh-huh, you heard the hook 
 No matter you Braveheart or shook 
 You can catch a bottle from the right, tap to the left 
 Kicks to the mids relievin you of breath 
 I seen it done sloppy, seen it organized 
 Some saw it comin' and for others it was SURPRISE 
 Catch a swollen eye and blood loss, courtesy of the 
 ** Jump, jump, jump to it! ** 
 ** Jump, jump, jump to it! **

 Yo! When they put the contracts out, bats and chairs included 
 Chicks can get into it - 'specially pretty broads 
 My New York City dawgs seem to master the art 
 When you hear the (""WHOO!"") that's when the bullshit'll start 
 It only takes a second less you got on ice 
 Just for wearin your chain in they club, they'll beat you twice 
 Served with fried rice, you get a can of whoop ass 
 My only advice is don't fall and book ass 
 For the nigga who slip, don't fall in a position 
 Where your lip'll catch a hickie (girl they'll fuck your mascara) 
 Shoot, go and ask Tara, just for havin' good hair 
 Man they left her ass cute, pulled it dead out the roots (ARRRGH!) 
 It's never one or two of 'em, they headin out in troops 
 Timbos, hoodies loose over jumpsuits 
 Waitin for the first vic to disrespect 
 Catch a double-dutch rope around your neck in the midst of the 
 ** Jump, jump, jump to it! ** 
 ** Jump, jump, jump to it! ** 
 ** Jump, jump, jump to it! ** 
 ** Jump, jump, jump to it! ** 
 (Pos) 
 It's schematically plotted out to break hearts and bodies 
 And ya best believe we came to party 
 Don't cause trouble but still can find double the crew 
 Against you and your peeps and leap-like-frogs on ya 
 For reasons like - not in the right part of town 
 Actin' like you wore a crown 
 Some occasions long and mean to earn the right 
 To throw signs wearin only one color scheme 
 And bein positive is no exclusion 
 That's an illusion - you can still catch contusions 
 For flossin your hard-earned shine 
 I'm talkin' games ?? ?? the longest 
 Then it's some other niggaz time 
 You'll get beat out of your mind just for rage 
 Shit my black ass almost got pulled off stage 
 Just for holdin' it down on the mic, you could be talkin', 
 ""Black people unite,"" and still catch a lump from the

 Yo, it's this joint, called the art of getting jumped 
 We had to put this one on the album y'know? 
 Yeah - this is dedicated 
 To them punk motherfuckers out in Germany 
 That Turkish gang that jumped me up in the fuckin' club 
 Tried to knock me senseless 
 They just couldn't get me though 
 That's why I second round outside on 'em 
 Pull out some fuckin' guns - punk bastards

 Ladies and gentlemen, we in the trench again 
 Makin' it relevant, just for the hell of it 
 I'm introducin it, throw a little juice in it 
 Got on that old bullshit to get you used to it 
 It's been a minute now, only a minute now 
 A little re-evaluatin, hope you feel me now 
 I'm on some new me, focused on the new tree 
 Tryin' to shake the money off the limbs so I can do me 
 I blame the fans for it, I heard demands for it 
 Went to Somalia, they holdin' out they hands for it 
 Went to the hood, these niggaz tried to trace a dance for it 
 Dancefloor it after Mase brings you out of the break 
 -- Before we go any further we wanna send a special thanks 
 To all those folks out there that been supportin De La since '89 
 Now that's a long time 
 Overseas, city to city, state to state 
 Yeah, we gon' keep bringin' it live to you...

 Unlike these underground MC's who rock for heads 
 We include the throat chest arms and legs 
 No need to spit in the cypher to show you I'm a lifer for rap 
 I cultivate moves larger than that 
 And I don't ball too much, ya dig 
 I gotta ball and chain at my crib who want my ass home 
 My heart-BEAT N.Y.C. metronome 
 But can't adapt to where I'm at 
 And even though I sing it sick till I'm blue, I'm not a crip 
 So unlike non-GANG members I won't C-walk to look hip 
 But if I had to join a gang I think I'd join GangStarr 
 Me, Guru and Primo with them beats for the car 
 That bounce trampoline style, revamp the deen child 
 Hot and mild and I hustle rap the same 
 Cuff a little shit, due to muscle fat, I gain 
 We them God type dishin the grunge to make you love 
 -- Yeah kids 
 Just a little taste how we gon' get things started in a minute 
 Sit back, get your headphones straight 
 Whether you're ridin' in a Escalade or a Pinto son, turn that shit up

 Starin' you down, make me Wonder Why 
 You women wanna frown at them stick figures 
 On them little ass girls, when a clique of niggaz 
 Run up and try to hurl game for real 
 Your frame holds appeal in the everyday

 To go, I'm tellin' you I had to let 
 Ya know, ya need to let it all hang

 Don't be scared to show a little of that thang-thang 
 No matter how you wear it girl it's femine 
 Kinda body everybody wanna know (Yeah yeah) 
 Be the private dancer in my Luke show (C'mon girl) 
 Skip the salad girl, bring us both a menu 
 Eat the whole box of chocolates I send you (Heh) 
 See girl, ya more than just the apple of my 
 Eye, confess I wanna get up in ya

 Don't mind you being conscious of ya calories 
 If gettin' paper stack man you'd get salaries 
 You ain't in this alone I got a tummy to 
 Just lemme watch the weight don't let it trouble you (C'mere girl) 
 Nine ten specimen up in ya jeans 
 You 'bout a size seven and just make it fit 
 Slim Fast, lypo, and body creams

 Puttin' out shiners that gave the cause

 I'm out to have fun without the problems that live with me 
 Not tryin' to be posh, but let's stay out the mosh pit 
 Tonight keep my nose out of trouble 
 Everybody in my bubble's been briefed 
 No beef, just party 
 Of course you're gonna have some clown niggas try to take us off course 
 Always lower levels tryin' to bring out the devil in us 
 Not condoned but its known 
 That a party ain't a party if the thugs don't try to shut it down 
 Tight security and it's still soft 
 Can't offset the thirty or plus caught in the rush 
 Keep the door sealed 
 Cause the floor's filled with action 
 And we don't need any distractions tonight, y'all

 As we go clubbin 
 Me and my peoples we be lookin' and we buggin 
 Off these ladies talkin' 'bout no dancefloor rubbin 
 Till we supply 'em with at least two to three mixed drinks from the bar 
 They must be out they mind, them rookies get dismissed 
 Cause it ain't hard to find, the ladies that can move it 
 To the latest bassline, attached to the drum 
 That'll set it off and make the local DJ a star 
 But can I get a boost from the bass and the treble? 
 This record ain't for soothin but for raisin blood levels 
 We simply havin' fun but know that some don't like the music 
 That it promotes rappin', and global gun-clappin 
 But still promoters packin in the clubs where I'm at 
 Plus everywhere I go so just realize the fact 
 That we won't be denied that respect you try to hide

 Allow me... to break it down... ah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah... 
 Life... (*humming*) 
 (Pos) 
 This is dedicated to all my folks 
 Diagnosed with a bad case of that proper upbringin 
 And never took the time to fall in line or follow 
 Or swallow the thoughts 
 Of the recognized committees who lurk throughout ya cities 
 Ya hood, ya town, no matter which type 
 You from the same type of people try to hold you down 
 Just because you tailor made for bigger and better things 
 Never missed a chance to move ahead of things 
 And what does it bring? I tell you for me 
 It brought jealousy in back wounds from all the stabbin 
 Cats posin as my fan just to get grabbin what's mine 
 I'm livin' in times where my daughters are found around 
 Kids who can't afford thinkin' caps 
 But always found drinkin' raps and eatin off beats 
 Claimin laws of the streets - but who made the laws? 
 Everybody playin' +Rebel+ with no sign of a +Cause+ 
 (Chorus: Cee-Lo) 
 Well I, feel the world around me 
 I've found, that others, will bring you down, just to be down 
 You've got to make up your mind, where you wanna be 
 Where you wanna go with your life 
 With your life... 
 (Pos) 
 Yo, I'm never singin' the blues but findin the clues to maintain 
 And I been blessed to reign supreme over nearly every dream 
 I had, and I made it come true 
 I'm an imperfect man and I'm holdin' the clue 
 To perfection, it doesn't seem to matter what direction I look 
 I find people settin traps 
 Tryin' to find the goal - without havin' any maps 
 Even friends of mine, jumped on line, just to become my adversary 
 They felt they were entitled to the dairy I made 
 They don't come to chill or behave 
 And they got, toast ready to burn 
 Not learnin to live, but they yearnin to take what you earn 
 (Chorus: Cee-Lo) 
 Well I, feel the world around me 
 I've found, that others, will bring you down, just to be down 
 You see - you've got to make up your mind, where you wanna be 
 And where you wanna go with your life 
 With your life... 
 (Pos) 
 So quick to place blame... and deny the shame we bring upon ourselves 
 So many names held accountable for my own account 
 When a large amount was weight - that I made and shaped 
 When I climbed I found 
 It was hard to find others around to point my fingers at 
 Which made me realize the truth 
 The biggest supressor could be your own ego lookin' for an excuse 
 To plant roots, in a field of self-sorrow 
 To sprout and follow the first thing you feel 
 Nourishes your hunger to be respected, it gets hectic 
 And when I'm watchin the news, and my daughter walks in 
 And choose to ask, ""Why were all those people on the floor 
 Sleepin', covered in red?"" I told her 
 That they were lookin' for God, but found religion instead 
 (Chorus: Cee-Lo) 
 Well I, feel the world around me 
 I've found, that others, will bring you down; just to be down 
 You see, you've got to make up yo' mind, where you wanna be 
 And where you wanna go with yo' life 
 With your life, with your life...

 I need my SPAAAACE, to live... 
 Well I, feel the world around me 
 I've found, that others, will bring you down; just to be down 
 You see, you've got to make up yo' mind, where you wanna be 
 And where you wanna go with yo' life

 Ya well advanced connect dance with thoughts 
 Deep like Barry White's throat box 
 I bet you those cops mix 
 Double high tower my power grants me the chicks 
 The blows the cars and enemies that wanna spar 
 You wanna see it no matter who you are 
 Yeah I'm bound to ground you like that 
 Put they ass on a mound and introduce em' to a baseball 
 Face tall, brag about it like teenage sex 
 Text book characters gettin' etched out to rough draft 
 Rush Limbaugh autograph her left titty 
 New Yor, New York yeah we bigger than the buildings 
 Do it for the love of the art and the childrens 
 And throw paper machet inside of ya models 
 See we all throttles, we zip by in this drive 
 Allergic to ya sperm broke hives 
 Concerned about ya ;ife when ya down eight lives 
 Top of the night I'm up in queens like ah yeah 
 Introducin' introducin' to you Dave 
 Batter on deck, carded every time I set foot in the joint 
 Cabaret artist I'll two piece ya tray 
 If she wanna get vamped, bring her to the tent 
 Touch her till her back indents 
 Wrap it extra strength 
 Run a lap on her calculatin' the length 
 Holdin' mics tighter than hymens

 Strong Jerome lovin' man I hit the pack 
 Panther power keep it all relative to the sixties

 Got my pockets lookin' like I'm rockin' Popeye jeans 
 Classic like Reuben and Rah 
 One nigga under the groove we shootin' for that Parliament high 
 Plus bigger than the fourth of July 
 Take the back seat drive out 
 Hey yo, hey yo ain't nothin' street about me more like a light post 
 Sinin' above all who are y'all to boast 
 Stayed calm and all came to me to host 
 My vocab grabs many, long to cultivate raps 
 It's gettin' filled moms jack penny 
 It used to be unknown around the way 
 Now my bix became a bouqet 
 Every nose in it, fillin' up seats like a session in a Senate 
 Been a minute since ya heard the souls 
 So the soul gon' cost ya three 
 All ya people wanna front like the soul don't hold control 
 But it don't mean shit to me 
 Plain to see that a song like this been what ya all missed 
 Come on, genuine adrenaline from off the wrists 
 We run the interference throughout the game clout 
 Can't be denied the bout for the title 
 Throw up ya guns and hold the pose like an idol 
 Bring it back to the draw 
 Ghosts of grand wiz Theodore 
 Played dirty with ever since played on the floor 
 Stop verbal assaults just in case a war break out 
 Steal vaults bigger than giraffes

 Heard em' say alot of nigga with the underground

 You gave ya all and I just gave it up 
 Put the truck in ya name 
 Damn ya should've known I was liability 
 Ignorin' the ways you would dress for a nigga 
 Express to a nigga I heard jibber and jabber 
 My apologies I left the wrong man to conduct 
 Take these jewels for the inconvience and neglect 
 You expect the worst of it 
 But I realize that I owe you more than explanation 
 I got my life in a box, what I'm supposin' is a joint account 
 It's cash on it, let's take our lil' business and incorporate it 
 It's me and you girl 
 First of all love, your soul caller 
 Before me helped create and shape your distorted image 
 See every man don't play or even scrimmage 
 That's a lie but I'm try to be that only one 
 You look to, to make you smile 
 First you need to check my files 
 Understand I play the partners sterotypical man 
 An regret the pain I may have left to flame 
 My people say ""Yo that's a fine girl ya mess with"" 
 But I told em' we havin' a mess 
 Ya charm must have calluses from the grip 
 That it has on my heart that I ain't tryin' to rip 
 But by now we both should know 
 That it's no longer where ya at but where we tryin' to go 
 So do ya background checks so I can pass through these borders 
 And stamp my name on a lil' man or a daughter 
 Come on girl

 When you go to sleep, you dream Jesus 
 When you wake up, you see Jesus 
 When you put your toast in the toast, who'll pop up? *ding* Jesus! (Jesus!) 
 When you take your clothes out of the dryer, who do you see? (Jesus!) Jesus!

 With Philly Black 
 Just layin' back, raisin' my stacks 
 Cause how they want it I give it to em' rock or the raw 
 Yo it really don't matter son, some hot shit for y'all 
 To go cop at the store, I spit, kick at ya jaw 
 Leave you on the floor on all fours, you slaw 
 We burn fast in black flag lands 
 Bringin' herds and caravans 
 And heat rock rhythms, you blink one, two times 
 In between I do mines 
 Showboat refs, I put y'all niggas on deck 
 Yeah son y'all faggots are soft 
 I been through, carried the torch 
 Recognized and done married a dwarf 
 So in-laws pay a writer's fee 
 My stizzy sets a wiz bitch's eye in me 
 Pissy in a rizzy 
 Indian wife I flip em' behind reachin' for sobriety 
 Blew north, never find me 
 Reside in this state of mind 
 Keep my temple developmental 
 Projects, front-line essential 
 Reminded of concubines and evil that men do 
 Cut off Ginsu, carry a brand new 
 Vandle issues, brandin' issues 
 Grabbin' tissues, like you didn't know you had it in you 
 I live it up y'all, givin' you what y'all 
 Need and can't call, carry the ball 
 Like a spit-kicker should and ya wish ya could 
 Hold it down like the digital who stitched the hood 
 Better yet the whole globe, light it up like a strobe 
 While you froze panicin' 
 Went from man to maniquin 
 We them peaceful rap stars 
 That can still jab ya in ya face 
 Leave ya shit redder than Mars 
 The sauce and shit, of course we it 
 The flossy shit 
 Groundin' beef like Maxwell House 
 Go ask the house 
 We representatives 
 Go call ya Senators 
 Change laws in rap, renovate ya landscape 
 The man takes for sixteen 
 And pull a paragraph up out the tango 
 Hangin' like vango 
 Water broke flows to c-sec 
 You read xecs 
 Miscarried the rap, abortin' ya whole fort"
115,De La Soul,hiphop,Am I Worth You?,"Yeah, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Yeah 
 It's a pity that you're so dirty 
 Worthy of some Southern hos-pital 
 See we them Northern boys with nose and how's 
 NYC livin' ain't nothin' like it 
 See how me and my peeps fit, we jigsaw 
 Sometimes I play big saw to cut the deal 
 And we keepin' them bills paid with meals in the mouths of many 
 A noble job at Feni 
 Money ain't everything but everything makes me want it 
 But won't dishonor my name so the claim throwers 
 Act like game on the dice on the mic device 
 Stay above middle class for life 
 Not an easy task but I've grown to love it 
 Dub it to tape, why don't you whip a grin 
 While I speak to my mens about the world problems 
 And girl problems with no immediate way to solve em' 
 But I'm on hits 
 I make the best of the life I be with it 
 Making the most of the moment among the livin' 
 And it feels good 
 Being the man that I want to be 
 Do what I can 'cause I refuse to see 
 The best of luxury, God's been good to me 
 Now I'm asking am I worthy of you, of you 
 Am I worthy of you 
 Pull them quarters down 
 I got some things on these nine ounces to vamp 
 Me on a mission y'all 
 Dug fresh dirt out the ground 
 Lookin' for the treasures in life 
 A bambino picket fence around the residence 
 I wore these shackels here for thirteen years 
 But the only real slaves is the ones we record on 
 We off all checks and God's blessin' 
 Tryin' to own a thousand island like we salad dressin' 
 Patience for the main course 
 Don't have me in position to remain boss 
 Cause the man next to the man above the exec 
 Don't give a damn if I papered yet 
 Sometimes it make me wanna go make a bet 
 I did away with knock em' and release some stress 
 By any means, these petty greens will only get me stuck in a box 
 Doin' a dick shot in Oz, jerkin' off in the J 
 But anyway I keep my head on 
 I know people who tippy-toe through they own stompin' ground 
 Master not makin' a sound to stay safe 
 From the local star renaissance 
 And the response is usually the same 
 Wishin' like it used to be 
 Nothin' in that life is new to me 
 We roll like eyes on a ghetto girl 
 Brushin' off some no-man 'cause she's his ghetto pearl 
 We into livin' beyond not livin' fads 
 Me and my comrads became dads young 
 Try to have fun amongst responsibility 
 Like fillin' these accounts full 
 Got caught up at a party in Bull's 
 Sometimes gotta have the nerve to say some rhymes 
 Because some minds take offense 
 Try to make ya life tense but we still here 
 Still gainin' the love, still standin' above most

 (When nature calls) 
 You know them boys will come runnin' 
 (When nature calls) 
 You know them girls don't mind comin' 
 (When nature calls) 
 You know them boys will come runnin' 
 (When nature calls) 
 You know them girls don't mind comin' 
 Just to get it started, for startin something 
 Is what we do to get some lovin' 
 What we do to get some lovin' 
 This what we do for love (do for love) 
 This what we do for love (for love) 
 This what we do for love 
 (Dove) 
 You ain't lyin', I 
 I 9-5 it, more like 12-12 
 Can't get the thought off (sex) 
 From off my mental shelf 
 (Slick Rick) 
 I'm like Bruce Lee 
 Beatin' up the cootchie profusely 
 My tomboy chicks that act a little to butchy 
 Receive this (uh) 
 When my semen ceases 
 They'll be screamin out, ""We love bein the female species"" 
 (Phone dialing) 
 Hello? 
 Veronica, it's Dove 
 Uh, I think you got the wrong number 
 What? 
 Veronica, your baby's crying 
 Yo, chill 
 Baby? 
 Whatever yo, later 
 (Dove) 
 For the past two summers I been sizin up Veronica 
 Southern belle, I heard she blow notes like a harmonica 
 Yamacas couldn't satisfy her spendin fetishes 
 She was all about gettin' the head like she was lettuces 
 (Posdnuos) 
 Yah, them types be actin' like they ain't sleazy 
 (Slick Rick) 
 Like this uptown chick playin' opposite of easy 
 Delighted, the honey fly difficult, couldn't knife it 
 Tiiight 
 Seen the imprint on honey's private 
 Now she's love sick 
 Ruler Rick scoress agaaaaain 
 (Posdnuos) 
 Sex present itself like trophies I'm out to win 
 And it's easier to claim with the fame I've obtained 
 Her mommy was a liar, she's so ashamed 
 (Slick Rick) 
 Well, I got this rude boy Jamaican honey at the rest home 
 Complete with yellow hair and Cinderella dress on 
 Whatever 
 Been around, stuck her till she poppin' bout 
 ""Hey take your blood clot finger off me bottom"" 
 Anyway, another dime I met one time 
 I'm kiiind, chick in the world, butt fine 
 And her, structure pumpin, told her 
 Gotcha mumblin bout 
 ""Slow down, what you tryin' to rupture somethin'?"" 
 (Posdnuos) 
 I don't bug out, I chill 
 Never copped a feel 
 But these pretty ass girls come and flaunt in the grill 
 Big ass eyes, with the matchin' big ass thighs 
 Asked her if she spare a moment to exchange some lies 
 ""But you got a girlfriend"" 
 (Slick Rick) 
 Yah trick, so do you 
 And I heard there's no preference in what gender ya do 
 (Posdnuos) 
 So stop playin' so squeaky clean 
 And let the dirty side see me later 
 So we can play 'away from the navy' 
 (Dove) 
 So stuck on the love you rearranging behaviors 
 Second episode, and you returnin oral favors 
 Buyin up groceries 
 Searchin for hosiery 
 Holdin' hands publicy 
 And now you supposed to be 
 Mr. and Mrs. huh, lovin' and kisses huh? 
 But while you away is when the milkman'll visit her 
 Dear to the heart, we dearly depart the fallen 
 So skip the games ma, I stay tuned to the calling"

120,De La Soul,hiphop,Trying People,"(Intro: A friend's voicemail to Dave) 
 Dave, whattup man? 
 It's me 
 Umm... just callin to see, if possible, if you have any 
 Time today or within the next couple of days 
 If, if, you're in the studio... or if you're at home... or car, whatever 
 That song... that... it's called trying or something, Mase 
 Was tellin' me that I needed to hear? 
 He said it was amazing 
 Whoo... the way he was talkin'... man I wanna hear it 
 (Dave) 
 Am I just another lost in the pack? 
 We for shack ship, you know laugh it off 
 Years just blow by 
 My eyes stay fixed but the picture's kinda outta focus 
 I cry a lot but admit to it 
 Enjoyin life now but I've been through it 
 Sometimes I wish that I can go back 
 No bills no kids just getting tore back 
 I want a wife, I love women 
 How could I front like I don't be in love wit em? 
 A li'l man that I can teach 
 A li'l sand but not the beach 
 I figure excess'll only bring an excessive amount of fussin 
 So when I'm gone, make sure the head stone reads, ""He did it for us"" 
 I'm like your modern day Jesus 
 I cherish warm thoughts like a gray goose 
 And float soft kisses to my baby 
 (Yo ain't that Dave's little girl?) 
 Yeah, respect her for that 
 She gon be somebody 
 Instead of somebody-baby-mama 
 You see young minds are now made of armor 
 I'm tryin' to pop a hole in your Yankee cap 
 Absorb me 
 The skies over your head ain't safe no more 
 And Hip Hop ain't your own 
 And if it is then you fuckin' up the crib son 
 You make life look like I don't wanna live one 
 You might as well hold your breath until you die in a 
 Corner somewhere bent over in the crevice 
 This God Theory overcomes the worst of weathers 
 As long as you willin' to try, you on a good start homie 
 ... You on a good start... see nigga tryin' 
 (Chorus: Dave and Children) 
 (Dave) People are you ready? 
 (Children) Yes we're ready 
 Are you really ready? 
 We wanna be ready 
 Ready for the change that may approach you? 
 Yes 
 Follow down the path that you supposed to? 
 Yes 
 People are you ready? 
 Yes we're ready 
 Are you really ready to try? 
 We wanna try harder 
 You know mistakes are trials that we learn from? 
 Yes 
 I order to live life, you must earn one? 
 Yes 
 People are you ready? 
 (Pos) 
 Throughout my change to grow, Some of my people got left behind 
 They didn't listen for the gun, as I leaped from off the line 
 Thirteen years deep in this marathon I'm runnin' 
 Paid dues and still got bills to pay 
 When I came back around the way 
 Old friends gave me dead eyes 
 And fake smiles, half wide 
 We were supposed to rid the world of danger 
 These days we nod heads and small talk like polite strangers 
 It's natural to fall off, just land close to the tree 
 I'll be there if they need me to be 
 And I know all my local shorties 
 'Cause they all know who I am 
 And latey wanna flip grammar instead of grams 
 Like that's the only choice they got 
 They tell me how they gonna shake up the game 
 But came to me to see if I could give 'em guidance for change 
 Shit y'all, I need guidance myself 
 And I chisel right words to make gems 
 Got fans around the world, but my girl's no one of em 
 And my relationship's a big question 
 'Cause my career's a clear hindrance to her progression 
 Said she needs a man and our kids need a father 
 I'm not at all ready to hear her say don't bother 
 And break 
 And this I know I can't take 
 But uh 
 C. Smith said to hold on 
 My brother Luck said to hold on 
 My nigga Dave said to hold on 
 My nigga Mase said to hold on 
 Yo, Maseo, we need to hold on 
 Eh, yo, y'all we need to hold on 
 (Chorus: Pos and Children) 
 (Pos) People are you ready? 
 (Children) Yes we're ready 
 Well, what you wanna be? 
 We wanna be ready 
 Do you wanna lose hate for love? 
 Yes 
 Do you wanna see these gates above? 
 Yes 
 I said people are you ready? 
 Yes we're ready 
 But are you willing to try? 
 We wanna try harder 
 Do you really wanna carry some weight? 
 Yes 
 Are you ready to design your fate? 
 Yes 
 Yo, people are you ready? 
 Yes we're ready 
 Well what you wanna be? 
 We wanna be ready

121,De La Soul,hiphop,The Grind Date,"If the meek shall inherit the earth 
 And not the weak 
 Let me inherit the street, fuck it 
 You know what I mean? 
 I mean I love life man, you know what I mean 
 Life is beautiful, it's just the shit in it that's fucked up 
 It's rough but it's fair 
 People gotta go out there and bust they, bust they ass for a job 
 I mean, my dad's got five kids, man and I mean yo 
 He hates drivin' a bus but he loves five kids 
 You feel me? 
 I'm a rhyme artist 
 Out here tryin' to grind my hardest 
 Up early so to milk the cow 
 Keep my John Deere out here plowin' the fields 
 To keep my John Hancock's worth up in the now 
 Went from hangin' on blocks to hangin' on charts 
 Positions is parta my mission to hangin' on top 
 Gotta get your Polly Cracker or with them crackers 
 And them scheisty ass niggaz if you like it or not 
 I've been rewired to work more efficiently in the dirt 
 I'm hands on with it all up in my cuticles 
 Some try to get off the farm but fell into harm 
 Of gettin' in the game of those street pharmaceuticals 
 But, I was raised in those blue collar themes 
 Havin' white collar dreams 'cause I see what it means 
 And though the meek shall inherit the earth but don't forget 
 The poor are the ones who inherit the debt 
 You can bet I got better things to do than that 
 I was a dick who got jerked by Tom and his boys 
 Came on my land, seized my cattle, and catalog 
 As if it wouldn't leave me less than coy 
 But I'm far from bitter even farther from quittin' 
 Got a grind date to make, no time for sittin' 
 And playin' Xbox, stand up and exercise my rights 
 As of by seen of through masta's eye 
 It's the grind date 
 Know what I'm sayin'? I'm sick of askin' that 
 I mean, the street philosophy is that 
 I'm gonna milk the cow and cook the meat 
 At least I'm gonna have some kind of food and drink 
 Because sometimes you can't come back 
 Like momma said that if you need 5 cents don't ask for 3 
 Ask for 10, that's for sure 
 Yo fuck a rhyme artist, I ain't here for that 
 I was born with the boom bap, respect the name 
 My hands on experience was hands on my first contract 
 Taught me quick how to respect the game 
 Introduced to the block, got used to the block 
 But your neighbors be the ones who throw shit on your lawn 
 It's like every single time we pop, they got annoyed 
 But we got ahead, and we got along 
 And puttin' work on the calendars, worse on them calendars 
 Worth of hump days that broke the camel's back 
 The grind'll make today look gray 
 And paint a tainted picture of tomorrows in enamel black 
 Meet the rhyme, street grind, son whatever the beast 
 I'm a take it at the horns till the pinky toe torn 
 And show you why we here this long 
 'Cause when it comes to puttin' in work 
 Once again it's on 
 I'm just like everybody else man 
 An average nigga with above average potential 
 You know what I mean? I'm not sayin' that I'm a gentleman 
 I'm sayin' that I know how to act like a gentleman 
 In order to get the things that I need 
 And if I gotta pull out my nickel bag, I'm gonna do that 
 This ain't no accident, we stayin' here 
 You damn right I am proud of myself man 
 And I'm proud of my team man 
 I don't want you to get the wrong, yo baby on the real? 
 I don't have sex with people I do business with neither 
 And that's the real 
 But I do do business with people that I have sex with 
 So if there ain't no conflict, let's get this grind on 
 'Cause I'm gonna fuck the shit outta you, that's word"

 For your nation...) 
 Verse One: 
 A bitch nigga wit an attitude named Cube 
 Step to Com wit a feud 
 Now what the fuck I look like dissing a whole coast 
 You ain't made shit dope since AmeriKKKa's Most 
 Wanted to cease from the Midwest to the East 
 On the dick of the East for your 1st release 
 Your lease is up at the crib, house niggaz get evicted 
 And videos wit white boys talking you get Wicked 
 Natural Born Killa, nigga you natural born God 
 Look, read listen, got the nerve to say you rob 
 Hyprocrite, I'm filling out your Death Certificate 
 Slanging bean pies and St Ide's in the same sentence 
 Shoulda repented, on the 16th of October 
 Get some beats besides George Clinton to rock over 
 Rap career is over, better off acting 
 What trouble I see, you're managing WC and Wack 10 
 You backed in to a four corner hustla 
 Lying on your dick, said you was fuckin' her 
 Use Higher Learning, don't take my words out of text 
 Went from gangsta to Islam to the dick of Das EFX 
 It'll take the Nation of Millions to Hold Me Back 
 From giving you mouth shots or hit wit the pipe Ralph got 
 When sucker ain't around, it's your Friday, it was good 
 I wasn't salty, she was wit the Boyz N the Hood 
 I see the bitch in you when you don't speak your mind 
 The bitch in you, looking me in my eyes lyin' 
 I see the bitch in you, simply hard, you find 
 The bitch in you but yo it's coming out 
 Verse Two: 
 Up on this rap shit, Cube, I'm calling out 
 I break in and smack niggaz that's in the Slaughterhouse 
 This ain't no East coast, West coast, none of the above 
 I'm from Chi, I went to Cali, niggaz gave me love 
 There's a thin line between the fake and the real 
 Grafted ass nigga, I see through your Glass Shield 
 Had skills once upon a time on this project, yo 
 I'm a have ta wreck a Ho'shea 
 I heard a ho say you her favorite rapper 
 (So what) so I had to slap her, ugn 
 And violate you, a Muslim drinking brew 
 Your nigga ain't no Mack 10, he's a 22 
 I seen you, you ain't say shit to ATL 
 Cube, I like that diamond charm, I might cuff it, then sell 
 It out, like you sold Kam and Threat 
 A year ago, you wasn't talking shit about the West 
 Guess you knew you're shit was done plus the one got you cable 
 Hoo Bangin', you ain't banging shit but the table 
 And the Circle Madd, ain't got no choice but to fight 
 Ain't none of y'all muthafukas got a chance on the mic 
 Anytime you come out, yo, I'm a talk about you 
 Until you let that bitch in you, walk up out you 
 Any last words before I hit the switch 
 From the immortal words of one, a bitch is a bitch"

 Aiyyo I jump back, put the aim on my shot 
 It's mandatory, handle glory over with the rock 
 I'm not a rough guy but a tough guy to beat over drums 
 No son to this, I'm a rhyme bastard 
 Some mastered the art of cash, but not the part that lasts 
 And disappear after doin' two albums 
 We're not your normal team and we still do ours to fit 
 Hope inside this, don't define it's 
 Quits for those who oppose the new 
 Playin' they've outgrown rap like a size 5 shoe 
 Oh they all {?} now, alternative touch 
 Were surprised, no demise for us 
 We on the rise to bust big, how you fig' we couldn't 
 Never run out of verbs for you to sip, I told you we wouldn't 
 I never popped Crist' or popped fists, girl named Chrissie 
 Was the first, which made it even worse not to miss me

 Bedtime till the next said time and date 
 Know the name and salute them dudes 
 Put the nutrient in rap when they cook them foods 
 Gotta be like eighteen million heads served 
 Shit, imagine if there wasn't no us huh? 
 So I'd like to take the time to shout out the JB's 
 Next on my list is A Tribe Called Quest 
 Latifah my Queen, Monie Love, Dres and Mr. Lawnge 
 Chi-Ali, on your head God bless 
 Never ring chasin, the permanent tat 
 In this rap shit, y'all are just temporary lick-ons 
 Fadin in the days to come 
 While the name De La and the legacy built lives on

 NYC gave you the ball, so how you gonna hate us? 
 We creators of them East coast stars 
 If you ask me I'll tell you there's no comp 
 But I'm still humble, even though I will crumble halls 
 Some call 'em songs, I call 'em words from me 
 That take long to cook 
 So some feel free in sayin' that we don't hunger for beats 
 Not that we not hungry, just picky in what we eat 
 Keep food off the mind and keep weight off the body 
 All you gotta do is keep my name out your mouth 
 And stop frownin like you hostile 
 You know that it's a booger rubbin up against your nostril 
 Nigga how you figure you can play this rap game without the backbone? 
 It's Maseo, Dave, Wonder Why, givin' what you lack holmes

 Aiyyo prepare yo'self for the Neutron, bitch! 
 This is eighty-six, let that neo-rap go 
 We present these flares to put fire to your ears 
 To lay smoke like rusty exhaust pipes 
 We run mics, let Sean run the marathon 
 Yo raise that money son, we raisin these kids 
 Get claps when curtains close, stage left 
 Up your stamina baby, bring some breath 
 SAT book smart, part ese 
 Loc'in like Tone, street niggaz get grown 
 Acquire more couth before you get poofed 
 Or get some shells sent over to your mic booth 
 Excuse, my delivery, but when peace don't work 
 See this piece gon' work, cock aim and SHOOT! 
 It's my constitutional right to bear arms 
 Arms and bare hands on mics, make fans unite

 So raise your guns or your glasses 
 Either way there'll be a toast in the air 
 Markin the return of bare minimums you need to learn 
 Get your verbs right when you down to clap

 See that gun powder calibre rap'll tip hats like gentlemen do 
 Smash tenements and skyscrapers 
 Bow-tie papers stacked high 
 Pay the resident tax or get your street sweeped 
 Front row, backstage or the cheap seats

 And I sup-pose you wanna top the Billboard chart 
 Man I toast these rhymes and then pop like Pop-Tarts

 (DJ Premier) 
 No doubt, y'all care anymore, about this hip-hop man? 
 I mean, how far will you punk motherfuckers go 
 For 15 seconds of fame? Microwave popcorn-ass niggers 
 Yeah, we give you much more, longevity baby 
 Aiyyo Dave 
 (Dave) 
 Yo! It's been instilled in me since infinite y'all 
 Usin' these minutes like I value the call 
 Put your money in the bank, and hold rank 
 Over friends who ain't got leadership skills 
 I got the sheep in my eyes so I can't sleep 
 We like the, land and laid, the brand old way 
 Grand operate the scandal way, L.I. sheist 
 I play the X-Box instead of fucking with dice 
 I hate losin to those who walk away with my dough 
 'Cause I dozed, Tracy broke me 
 And now she wanna see the resident provoking me 
 To pop wheelies on my bicycle, watch her eyes twinkle 
 One house, two houses, third house 
 House rules so house take bank, watch Dave bank 
 Banner had 'em on the hawk since Atlanta extravaganza 
 Gamma ray rap I make the Hulk snap 
 Jump back like James Brown, hey now 
 When the liquor over we smoking the hay now 
 Delegating numero dos, I holla out the sound of los 
 And keep the Island close to me 
 (Chorus: Yummy) 
 Much more is what we got in store 
 Just believe me 
 ""And what we have is much more than they can see"" 
 Much more than they can see 
 Is how it'll always be, believe me (gotta believe) 
 ""And what we have is much more than they can see"" 
 (Posdonus) 
 I got verb skills, babies and bills, brothers who smoke krills 
 And still tryin' to get himself together from it 
 Knowin' he can't quite run it like me 
 I'm on the cutting edge of what's alleged to be, hot 
 And when you rock, it's just impersonations of me 
 The rightest MC, MP with the V in the middle 
 I belittle your plan, courtesy, of NY dirty C my man 
 My base of fans are made up of many; with kids allergic 
 To belts letting they mind melt from drinkin' the Henny 
 And them straight and narrow types who be waitin to hear 
 Them drums say the revolution is near - are you listening? 
 Are your eardrums open for christening? 
 We God Body MC's with these tools 
 While some others play God, they just god damn fools with it 
 I don't cuff mics, I rough mics up rough and rugged 
 Get the girls to love it 
 Still and all five-oh came to my mic check 
 Tellin' me I left lacerations around my mic's neck 
 Domestically disputed and you just might get 
 The undisputed underdog servin' y'all threat 
 [Chorus] - 4X w/ ad libs 
 ""And what we have is much more than they can see"" 
 ""And what we have is much more than they can see.."""
126,De La Soul,hiphop,Shopping Bags (She Got From You),"(We not goin' to JC Penney's, we not goin' to Macy's either) 
 (Chorus: Daniel Wallace) 
 Shopping bags they weigh down her arm 
 Popping tags and collars her charm 
 All them things she got, she got from you 
 All them things she got, she got from you 
 Manolo and Prada's her style 
 Louis, Burberry by the pile 
 All them things she got, she got from you 
 All them things she got, she got from you 
 (Posdonus) 
 Yo she know you come to do it, so what'cha want 
 Candelight might flick at'cha 
 Put your credit card to it, she know what to flaunt 
 Her handle tight like a master 
 She used to taunt on the runway, yeah she's down to tree 
 The avenue like her catwalk 
 Struck a bit to the gunplay, that housing street 
 Looks to die for, ask that chalk man for yo' hand 
 Spend it, you live to show 
 All the cash that you can burn 
 What you need is to end it, cause you give the dough 
 But get no ass back in return {*HA, HA HA*} 
 Stay laughin', straight at you dog 
 Best believe, you wastin time 
 Don't deny what's happenin', just clear the fog 
 And achieve you a peace line, yo it goes like 
 (Daniel Wallace) 
 She got from you, she, sh-she, she got it 
 She got from you, she, sh-sh, sh-she got it 
 (Dave) 
 Her frame goes beyond thick, she got you stunned 
 Livin' it up off the pop hits 
 Like a dame on a Bond flick, she's not the one 
 To give it up till you cop shit 
 Just because she's stacked right, she got your soul 
 Her every wish you now obey 
 You should be on that actright, but she got control 
 She say jump you scream, ""OKAY! I'M RELOADED!"" 
 Nigga you shootin blanks 
 Tryin' to front like you got game 
 Her crib is sugar coated, like she lootin banks 
 But it's your wallet she done claimed 
 When the limit of your plastic, reaches the end 
 You start payin' for your time 
 She'll be in it for the last bit, of money to spend 
 {*HA, HA HA*} And you'll be left with dimes 
 While she fillin up 
 (Daniel Wallace) 
 She got from you, she, sh-she, she got it 
 She got from you, she, sh-sh, sh-she got it

 Peace - this is Spike Lee 
 A.k.a. Shelton Jackson Lee 
 A.k.a. loving husband and father 
 Of Tonya and Satchel and Jackson 
 I'm here with De La Soul 
 A.k.a. De La, a.k.a. The Plugs 
 We're about to get in this song, ""Church"" 
 A.k.a. ""It's Reality""! 
 Aiyyo, wake up! Wipe the sleep from ya eyecracks 
 It's time to focus y'all, fix ya I-MAX 
 In other words, listen to the brother's words 
 Ingest these anecdotes with HOPE 
 And ya ass, may learn how to COPE 
 It's not always good just to get by 
 Who's coverin' ya stakes when ya bet high? 
 You're cha-sin', cars, clothes and rocks 
 Identify with the goods you got 
 Make sure it's V-S-One, not 
 And perfect, leavin' you one clear 
 I really don't care to see ya tattoos there 
 I'd rather see you graduate the school year 
 Black folk, go put a book in ya face 
 But first give the hook a taste 
 Bring the preacher in! 
 Heal! Heal, y'all! 
 We comin' healin'! {It's real!} 
 It's real! {It's real!} It's real! 
 It's realer than real, realer than real 
 Heal! Heal, y'all! 
 We comin' healin'! {It's real!} 
 It's real! {It's real!} It's real! 
 It's realer than real, realer than real 
 It's a sick world that we live in, let some tell it 
 Some put it in books, some yell it 
 You need to make your own choice, be your own voice 
 Set ya soap-box up, let your talk fight 
 Pull ya socks up, get ya walk right 
 Or the chalk might outline ya one day 
 You oughta try steppin' outside you one day 
 You circle round yourself like you the answer 
 To the question of your inner son 
 But keep ya falsehoods to a minimum (minimum *echoes*) 
 We all need a little church 
 A life update, keyword - update 
 If they don't serve change, don't bite the bait 
 Instead'a givin' you a share, servin' you a dish 
 I lead you to the water, show you how to fish 
 Ain't nothin' wrong makin' that bread wid'it 
 But don't let the bread get to ya head, geddit? 
 Admit it, when you can't stand alone 
 I wanna stand up, give all the pretend up 
 And get a full blast of my demands of 
 The rhyme runner said the man's come 
 There's something in our words that reveal (reveal *echoes*) 
 Sho 'nough real! 
 Heal y'all! We come to heal! 
 So let it heal you!{It's real!} It's real! 
 {It's real!} It's real! 
 It's realer than real, realer than real 
 Heal y'all! We gonna heal it! 
 So let it heal! {It's real!} It's real! 
 {It's real!} So real! 
 It's realer than real, for real, for real 
 The early bird gets the worm in this rotten apple 
 But explore deep and you will the find the seed 
 Plant more ether, get your mind free 
 We roll passsionate, put your lights last in it 
 You're holdin' fear too close, unfasten it! 
 And like old age invades youth 
 Invade falseness with truth 
 Replace rebelling with rebirth 
 Face new dwelling, that's your turf 
 Lean back and put your feet up on the sofa 
 Relax! (Relax! *echoes*) learn how to punch back 
 And do your work to the max 
 The payoff's much sweeter than the payback 
 Even the haysack needle wouldn't play that 
 So let's pray at, church (church *echoes*) 
 Heal! Heal, y'all! 
 We comin' healin'! {It's real!} 
 It's real! {It's real!} It's real! 
 It's realer than real, realer than real 
 Heal y'all! We comin' healin'! 
 So let it heal! {It's real!} 
 It's real! {It's real!} It's real! 
 It's realer than real, realer than real

 (Spoken outro) 
 You know what I mean? Rap outsold crack 
 You know, so rap... or hip-hop culture 
 However you wanna dice it, you know what I'm sayin' 
 It's the most powerful drug there is, man 
 It changed corporate America, it changed the way you feel about me 
 It change the way I, I do my thing now 
 Busta was the one who came out, on the award show and said that 
 Hip-hop provides jobs for people who don't even love the shit 
 I mean, come one man, I mean what else is there to say?!"
128,De La Soul,hiphop,It's Like That,"(Dave) 
 It's like, New York without a New York yanks 
 Better yet, New York without the New York franks 
 It's like hot summers without no A.C 
 Or never hitting numbers when you go to A.C 
 It's like six years of your life, go ask Rob 
 I'm like ""Yo how is it?"" he like ""It's like hard"" 
 Trying for that queen but you nothing but a man 
 You wanna keep it clean but you can't 
 Why it gotta be, like, that 
 And what the life, see life is like a J shot 
 Shooters son, they got 
 One point one second, you half court 
 I'm feeling the adrenaline like you half court 
 Like pink slips and dipping these ink tips to paper 
 Imagine if we fuck around and lose Hip-hop 
 Imagine if it didn't exist 
 Imagine nothing shining your wrist 
 See, imagining to you is a risk 
 But think about it, like no chrome rims 
 And tims would be construction boots (ill) 
 We probably wouldn't even substitute (ill) 
 For words we use defining our likes 
 I'm coal mining these mics 
 To keep that gold nugget like Dave Megget 
 Giant like a motherfucker, like Dave said it 
 But ya ain't listening, ya paper gon' stack 
 Why it gotta be like that? 
 That, dadadat, dadat, dadat, dadat, dadat, dadat, dadat, dat 
 Dat, dadadat, dadat, dat, dadadat, dadadat, dat, dat, dadat, dadat 
 (Chorus: Carl Thomas) 
 Just running, running, fast as I can 
 I'm trying to be a person but I gotta be the man 
 If I, can't stand the life that I'm in 
 I gotta keep running 'cause I'm still gon' win 
 Yes I got to go on (it's like that, it's like that) 
 Yes I got to go on (it's like that, it's like that) 
 (Posdonus) 
 It's like, Slick Rick without the eye patch 
 More like, saying slick shit you won't catch 
 It's like bed time without your PJ's 
 Or no fed timing in out the PJ's 
 It's like, one minute you got it, then you broke 
 Like what I do with it? I copped a few with it 
 Looking like a problem, but you won't get it solved 
 You working but you won't get the job 
 It's like, who would have thought (thought) 
 It you would of bought (bought) 
 Into my religion you'd be more like God 
 But you were steady swimming so you more like cod 
 See these fools is fish scale, converting to ish male 
 See I see it like, A alike, B alike 
 I was taught, if you play alike, be alike 
 How they don't see it for one to go pop 
 And this is how you treat Hip-hop? 
 Imagine if you didn't have that phantom chrome sitting on a curb nigga 
 The word nigga wouldn't be a bit disturbing nigga 
 See them roots are like begging for the rain 
 You entering my kingdom just a begging for the reign 
 Putting shit stain to paper 
 Ink pain feeling like fifty-five licks on a slave niggaz back 
 And not a one of y'all stopping to hate 
 But why it gotta be like that? 
 That, dadadat, dadat, dat, dat, dadat, dat, dadadat, dat, dat 
 Dadadat, dadat, dadadat, dat, dat, dat, dat, dat, dadat, dadat, dat"
129,De La Soul,hiphop,He Comes,"""Oh, whaddya know? He comes"" 
 (Posdonus) 
 Down, like water, fresh out the clouds clown 
 Drown you like terrible weather 
 Nobody does it better than I, so approved by Carly Simon 
 Most rappers is real hard, but still hardly rhymin 
 To all - rise and shine - give God the glory 
 I already give a percent of mine to Bert and Cory 
 And still got bills and employees to pay 
 So excuse me Lord, we'll settle up towards the end of my days 
 My ways of control is hard to swallow 
 Known to lead, but some would rather see me follow behind 
 Sorry to dis-appoint, but dis joint's mine 
 Dis-play your indie but say no - 
 - More or I'll blind you like spit did to Remo 
 - To the dirt - and edit the clip and lost Kano 
 My mens wear problems like Timbs 
 See it all in they face, ask Mase, he got wars to win 
 Scores to settle, crews to crush 
 You rush right in to see him do it with a smile 
 It's Long Isle y'all, longevity sustainin my celebrity status 
 From AM to PM, you see him on file y'all 
 I was told to step righteous, so when it's done 
 Everyone will say I stepped right 
 And whether through religion, or stopped by the cop 
 Shinin his flash in my face, I'm bound to see the light 
 ""A few short words, and whaddya know?"" 
 ""Oh, whaddya know? He comes"" 
 (Dave) 
 Aiyyo I'm up against these walls, here's my back stiff straight up 
 Dazzle and razzlin broads like I'm little Juan Magic 
 Magnetically handle mics, they don't drop 
 Top drama every time these commas don't drop 
 Pop spots like lint on your shirt, the net worth 
 To shoot the rock homey in many courts of ball 
 Four couldn't do it, so we bring all six 
 I circumcise the track, you just a dick - overlapped and hooded 
 Skin repeated like Stutterin John 
 I repeat like yesterday, it don't stop 
 George of this poor life pop, put to Scarlet 
 In a place she believes, much better than your lies 
 She say she lookin' better in my eyes, bullshit! 
 Same crock she done ran to duck, crammin to fuck 
 I put the pudding on her like Bill Cosby 
 I tried to speak my piece in court but Judge Mills paused me 
 Bifocusedly die hopeless sometimes 
 Yo cry your poker face, you oughta try it one time 
 When God is an non pos', you stand to download 
 Demanded like slaves on trial - we want free 
 Man cock aim ready, it's time you MC 
 So you rappers bust bee-bee guns, graffiti runs 
 Through my veins since cable with the wired remote 
 Woodgrainin like you wired his float 
 (Ghostface) 
 C'mon, Pretty Toney and De La Soul 
 We was rhymin through the frozen street since 8 years old 
 Take us back to eighty-eight, you couldn't catch our flow 
 A group of kids so original 
 [Ghost] You heard? 
 (Ghostface) 
 Tony 'Tana with big hammers for bad manners who got 'em 
 We kiss cannons for Scrangelous crew, and his whack dancers 
 Bitin is forbidden pah, pay that tax 
 And don't you ever look at us funny - boy, we'll bring rap back 
 And that'll hurt you like Superman, chased by a group of men 
 With dyna-mics, real hip-hop'll do you in 
 For you like Loo Goo Kim, or Moo Loo Inn 
 Hula hoop all bitches crew full with brand new Keds 
 Cutmaster kill 'em, make sure we cut classics 
 Buck bastards in broad day and tuck caskets 
 Next to Uday and Qusay, how can the group shoot the PA 
 And just lay whooptay whooptay? 
 Use the ruse, sport beads and snatch a dude's toupee 
 Since tunin into T-La Rock'n AJ 
 Ghostface gats is freshed squeezed like a glass of OJ 
 Girls you can go cruisin in my OJ 
 ""A few short words, and whaddya know?"" 
 ""Oh, whaddya know? He comes"""

 Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh 
 [Chorus: De La] + (Common) 
 [Dave] Yo how the days of your life go Com? (I'm just tryin' to be) 
 [Pos] That's it? (Stayin focused so my mind is free) 
 [Dave] Watch the problems of the world go by like balloons 
 [Dave] If tomorrow come now (it might be too soon) 
 [Pos] Too soon? 
 (Common) 
 I want the boom in the back of the truck 
 Ain't nuttin the matter with a good dude havin' a buck 
 With that on my mind, I'm on the grind, it pays 
 We break it down in these three ways, yo 
 These days, I travel the Maze like Frank Beverly 
 To the East, lookin' for pieces of a better me 
 Responsibility of my man's felony fell on me 
 Celebrity status, make 'em think I got celery 
 Hell and I do sometimes, still the sunshine ain't even all day 
 (Yeah) The life of a baller, ain't even all play 
 I stack 'em, so the chips fall where they must 
 I ain't far from a Benz, or dude on the bus 
 Even when I don't have enough, still in God I trust 
 Said baby you're a star 
 Said I'm on the car, seen the jiggiest of stars 
 Become dust, and one love become lust for the papers 
 Had you gassed now that - gas became vapors 
 Tricked your cash on ice; shoulda had acres 
 Now your, empire fell like the Lakers 
 So you're talkin' to your maker 
 It's the nature of the business, they givin' niggaz inches 
 Takin' miles and mules, it's the wildest rules 
 I'm tryin' to walk in the black scent of proudest shoes 
 Makin' music that the crowds can use 
 [Chorus: Pos, Com] + (Dave) 
 [Dave] Yo how the days of your life go Dave? (With sunshine and shade) 
 [Com] That's it? (Tinted window grades and Kool-Aid) 
 [DeLa] Watch the problems of the world go by like balloons 
 [DeLa] If tomorrow come now (that might be too soon) 
 [Pos] Too soon? 
 (Dave) 
 I want twenty-four plus on these 
 Put the pinto engine and the bus on these 
 I get that first class seat to escape the days 
 We break it down in these three ways 
 Check the life I got that antidote, canteloupe scent, bent back 
 In the sunroom froze, put your flick on pause (and pop a cork) 
 There's no occasion nigga it's just because 
 I'm celebratin' for a hell of a day 
 Get these barbie filets on hot charcoal tracks, so black 
 Darko Pecoltrane plays them back 
 We them freedom fight kids who gon' ball and raise fists 
 If y'all down for the struggle, c'mon y'all, resist 
 Everyday script, I exercise cheek 
 Sixteen on the bar, I exercise speak (ha) 
 It's been a long time, Long Isle's on the map 
 While y'all stand on the corner, stoned like Chris {?} 
 Kiss back, watchin time - wrist back 
 Every second count but just finish this lap 
 You gamble on your life like casino slots 
 And cash out and still walk with a knot 
 [Chorus: Com, Dave] + (Pos) 
 [Com] Yo how the days of your life goes Merce? (Man I'm just holdin' my head) 
 [Dave] That's it? (Shit, I'm also tryin' to hold this bread)

 [DeLa] If tomorrow come now (that might be too soon) 
 [Dave] Too soon? 
 (Posdonus) 
 I furnished the rooms, and mortgage on these 
 See them quittin ass rappers caused a shortage on these 
 The soul boys of big illa-noyz get the praise 
 We break it down in these three ways 
 My moms died from secondhand smoke; so I wish yo' ass would die 
 From them secondhand rhymes you wrote 
 Or shall I call them second rhymes - written seconds 'fore you enter the booth 
 Words thrown together with very little truth 
 And a select few can do it (true) you ain't part of them scriptures 
 And got the nerve to feel you want me out the picture 
 But I was never in it, I'm the frame around the flick 
 Or dishin in the mouth of your dame around my dick 
 Ladies and gentlemen, introducin Workmatic 
 One of L.I.'s finest, and this is ""MY LIFE"" 
 Which is filled with bad minutes and good hours 
 And, good months and bad years and with my peers 
 We struggle to juggle the shit 
 Family life and the music game don't easily fit 
 My lady wants me home, sayin' rap tour three rap whores 
 And scores of scandal, even more than we can handle 
 Sometimes, the rhymes I say 
 Is the fly the currency to save the day 
 Can't turn it away, 'cause we out 
 To find presennce way beyond our measure, so baby don't pout 
 (Common) 
 Don't pout, De La Soul now turn it out 
 Don't pout, Common Sense'll turn it out 
 Don't pout..."

 Yo check one two, this is the voice of yours truly the Flava Flav 
 And I just want y'all to know, we ain't goin' nowhere 
 Old school is here to stay BOY! 
 [Posdonus] + (Flava Flav) 
 On the outskirts, of what works 
 Live those who go for broke, and merk to get merked 
 Live by the sword and die by the semi 
 Not part of my ways, but stays right in my 
 N.Y. mentality for me to be the best 
 The current, the ones who weren't 
 Pressed, to confess lies over hot joints 
 To sell to all who wanna hear some 
 (Young'uns these days got fireproof eardrums!) 
 They don't give a SHIT who's hot 
 Just long as you're not, pussy, and be the would-be King 
 But once crowned, the same wanna pull you down 
 (And what makes the world go 'round!) 
 And I be the world renowned Wonder Why 
 Wonderin why you can't stand me 
 Is it because I'm the main Jackson 
 And y'all just Titos and Randys? (Yes, it is!) 
 Bless the kid who hold his own head and expect to last 
 At the same time, I want respect and cash 
 And a few paragraphs in them books 
 Tellin' you how us Native Tongues made hits with no hooks 
 Rapped in every prefixes, gave birth to rap remixes back in '88 
 No disrespect to Diddy just settin it straight 
 Instead of zig-zaggin, got a degree in braggin 
 My daughter says I'm a teen, cause like a teen 
 My pants always saggin and I walk with a bop 
 The {?} part of my time, I walked from my pop 
 No longer on timey and was never on Loud 
 But cooked rhymes that make the Chefs of Wu proud 
 I'm top cloud to rain on your show

 Had bottom inner drawers and used to hit it from the mids 
 Fix your playground player or some kids'll 
 Come stomp in your sandbox, swollen hands cocked back 
 No knives, no drama, no guns 
 No disrespectin your seed or Ma Dukes 
 I puke rhyme and you laugh, take a sniff 
 Of these fricaseed raps on Caribbean riffs 
 See last night's change was today's dough money 
 No time for your freestyles so roll money 
 No more whack albums with two joints 
 No more ballplayin rappers who shoot ya two points 
 (No more G 'cause I'm sick of your hip-hop!) 
 Your flows bore like seashores with no bitches 
 Switchhittin niggaz will receive no pitches 
 No diamonds on the field, just keep the game real 
 Simple, see the God flows healthy 
 Wealth in the mind is like money in the bank 
 Exchange cash like thoughts in conversation 
 Thank you for your purchases, we dough out 
 And roll out the Kool-Aid, {?} see us pimp strut 
 Ain't really pimpin', I'm tryin' to catch the bus 
 The Krush Groove ain't got shit on Cold Crush! 
 We dolly dolly babies 'cause we shootin cats 
 'Back to the Future' rap with Doc Brown shotgunnin it 
 And pantyhose your whole style and start runnin' it 
 You dudes fiddle while we stay on the cello 
 The mush-in-your-room son, we stay portobello 
 Can't settle for the same picket white fence 
 I got dreams of barbed wire in front of factories pa 
 Still push the truck with the factories pa

 But my position went temp' to perm' 
 I sat and listened like an intern watchin who applied get fired 
 Now I'm sittin' in the break room, they gotta make room (make room) 
 My paper stacks, put staples through 'em 
 So I can keep my money together 
 Some die-hard fans just don't want it like, ""Put Pos back on it"" 
 (Posdonus) 
 I'm back on it, that's why you never disappointed 
 We give you what we live through for real (for real) 
 Don't own a crown but I'm royalty 
 And tryin' to see the royalty checks about a half a mil' 
 Whether off or on the chart, my cuts grips your heart 
 (You know we got you open) like your gut splits apart 
 I never pass the buck, my shoulder holds the weights 
 So don't beef when we don't pass collection plates 
 (Butta Verses) 
 I don't give money, I don't support the needy 
 Schooled in America, taught to be greedy 
 And everything ought to be, easy 
 But I never could say goodbye to my friends who get high 
 I wonder why, I'm rockin' with that guy, it's serious 
 Still make him cry when the satire's hilarious 
 Cold for your areas, flows come in various shapes and sizes 
 So hot that you despise it 
 [Chorus: Dove] + (Yummy) 
 Never last up to bat (no no no no) 
 These skills we don't lack (no no no no) 
 We never fall and pray (no no n-no no) 
 Make all the ladies say (ooh ooh baby) 
 You can't knock the hustle - not at all (no no no no) 
 Can't be budged by your muscle (no no no no) 
 Never ridin' on E (no no n-no no) 
 It's De La and Butta V (drive you crazy) 
 (Posdonus) 
 Yo, if you are what you eat; some of you 
 Cats heads between your girl's legs a lot cause y'all act too sweet 
 (Go brush your teeth!) Then after that 
 Put in a little more practice on your rhymin attack 
 What you write's not the least bit hot 
 Maybe cause your wrist is so cold from all that ice you cop 
 Hate to hate a playa but you know what? 
 I still smother ya like cheese and rockin' leaves freshly cut 
 (Butta Verses) 
 And we the steak and potatoes and De La's the greatest 
 And ladies be on the floor thankin' the Lord that He made us 
 I'm tellin' you, I swoop her like a pelican do 
 You sayin' - look at that pelican fly; you spittin' gelatin rhymes 
 They shaky as shit, ugly in the mold you fit 
 We the square peg on the round hole, sound's soulful 
 Your imitation flavor is tofu 
 It's true we make our bed all day, and we are... 
 (Posdonus) 
 ... The world of rap! Take you back 
 In the days of all four hundred ways that people lack 
 It's that (what) authentic, big-nosed mic music 
 Four to five survive all night to it 
 I'm tryin' to keep up with my Jones' and Thomas' 
 Till I'm broke like them New Year's Eve promises 
 And that's all right, I just penned another sixteen 
 To fill my bank account with the mixed greens 
 (Butta Verses) 
 Moms want 5's and 10's 
 The girls I got is 9's and 10's, VH1 ""Behind The Pens"" 
 You anticipate greatness from elder statesmen 
 I ch-ch-ch-Ah, like Biz Mark' or Jason 
 I bust one shot just to start the racing 
 The tortoise and the hare, which one there is chasin? 
 Slow and steady, we already Andretti 
 Get ticket take parades, waves and confetti and... 
 [Chorus] w/ minor variations 
 [Pos] Come on y'all 
 (Yummy: repeat 4X) 
 If the Soul keeps rockin', the streets will keep rockin' 
 If the streets keep rockin', the Soul will keep rockin' 
 If the streets stop rockin', the Soul will keep rockin' 
 If the Soul keeps rockin', the streets will keep rockin'"
133,De La Soul,hiphop,Rock Co.Kane Flow,"(Posdonus) 
 Up in them five-star tellies and two mic rhymes 
 Be them average MC's of the times 
 Unlike them, we craft gems 
 So systematically inclined to pen lines 
 Without sayin' a producer's name, all over the track 
 Yeah I said it! What you need to do is get back 
 To reading credits, we them medics 
 Alphabetically stuck on that English 
 And knock it out before we pour 
 That sure shot more rock co.kane flow 
 (MF Doom) 
 From the top of the key, the 3 Villain 
 Been on in the game as long as you can wheelie your Schwinn 
 Turn the corner spinnin, bust that ass and get up 
 Dust off the mask, whoever laugh give him a head up 
 He got jumped, it pumped his adrenaline 
 He said it made him tougher than a bump of raw medicine 
 To write all night long, the hourglass is still slow 
 Flow from Hellborn to Free Power like Wilco 
 And still owe bills, pay dues forever 
 Slay huge when it comes to who's more cleverer 
 Use to wore a leather goose ski with a fur collar 
 Hand charged a fee for loose leaf words for dollar 
 Ya heard? Holla - broad or dude, we leave food 
 Eat your team for sure, the streets sure seem rude 
 For fam like the Partridges, pardon me for the mix-up 
 Battle for your Atari cartridges or put your kicks up 
 It's a stick up 
 (Dave) 
 Now put your blix up, these Riddick Bowe cuts 
 Is swoll like penile flicks, give 'em 20 
 The danger in his eyes'll let you know he's a brawler 
 Bring your tallest champs like that much taller 
 Ten pounds heavier, one step ahead of it 
 Vocab, stamina, style's all irrelevant 
 Camps and cliques, units, squad crews and clans 
 Even your tongues'll fuck around and leave your mouth 
 (MF Doom) 
 Doom brung that bum, there goes that news van again 
 Act like you knew like Toucan Sam an' 'em 
 He eat rappers like part of a complete breakfast 
 Your rhymes ain't worth the weight of they cheap necklace 
 String 'em up, bring 'em up under whack junk snack 
 And get that out your hand, punk, jump and get your dunk smacked 
 Foul, we all know the rules bro 
 You slow, you blow the soup on your fools, his Impulse like Yugo 
 (Posdonus) 
 You go lights, camera, action with no makeup 
 We De La to the death, or at least until we break up 
 Here's a couple of nice guys who finished first 
 So nice try, but the prize is ours dispersed 
 They say the good die young, so I added some 
 Bad-ass to my flavor to prolong my life over the drum 
 Everyone cools off from bein hot 
 It's about if you can handle bein cold or not! 
 And we was told to hop for no one, s'what I dig bout Prince Paul 
 We stayed original ever since y'all 
 First to do a lot of things in the game, but the last to say it 
 No need to place it on a scale to weigh it 
 And don't do it for the plays or to raise the bar 
 Yet it's raised anyway, it's so amazing, are 
 The three L.I. brothers from a other way of thinkin' 
 Hey your lady's winkin, I think you need to control that aura 
 Or I can hold her 
 (Dave) 
 The elements are airborne, I smell the success 
 (Yo let's cookie cut the shit and get the gingerbread, man) 
 Sacrifice mics and push drugs to these rappers 
 Puff ponies till I turn blue in the lips 
 Sippin broads like 7-Up (ah) so refreshing 
 I think I'll pop these verse like first dates to birthdates 
 September 2-1, 1-9, 6-8 
 Too old, should I? Too bad, too late"
134,De La Soul,hiphop,Voodoo Circus,"Dave: 
 Kick up the dust like ""Another One Bites the"" 
 It ain't the Queen version, see you heard 'em back on Bentley Road 
 With the show council - whattup Divine - the bell rang 
 It ain't no champagne fall, we dump the taste through the crack 
 For the folks under the floor, on tour {*beatboxing*} 
 Ever since I was a ""Fat"" bastard 
 But now I travel a little light in my skin 
 It ain't all that cute, I still tuck a little in 
 Like {?} body sting 'em Ray sting 'em, Ray sting 'em (""Sting 'em Ray!"") 
 I blind box, niggaz hit 'em when I hear 'em 
 It stays six here to bake you rap crumbcakes 
 So scrumptious with cholesterol 
 Lube out your squeak, your selection is weak 
 This combination is like Halle and Beyonce (BAD!) 
 But smooth like Ponce DeLeon 
 Explorin this Dave West bounce that we on 
 On on on on on on on... 
 (""Here's a very curious thing, a verse that'll fit any song"") 
 Pos: 
 We all do what we gotta do 
 When no love in the heart of a city 
 No love in the heart of a crew, so most break up 
 Others stay together, cause there's not enough money to leave 
 They tryin' to get the cake up, frost it out a little 
 In eight days and wake up, exercise demons 
 Leave you in a state screamin, ""Come back De La, come back~!"" 
 Sorta how Prince did to Nikki 
 No need for that, here to give it to you quickly 
 Cause some of y'all lookin' kinda sickly 
 Eatin that bullshit rap (word) split ya asshole 
 Then let all the whack shit fall out 
 Then come grab another pouch and sprinkle us in (sprinkle it) 
 Until you stay twinklin, roll your ass up 
 No I won't pass up a toke, for all the shit De La wrote 
 So smell us all on your clothes 
 Try to wash us out, we ain't comin' out, that's how it goes 
 Winner of the pro see- FUCK ALL AWARDS (""Fuck all y'all!"") 
 Dave: 
 Yeah, and wipe your face pa 
 Your bone swat on speak tongues that ain't near ya 
 I knew Cayman since we met on the Island 
 Kodak kid (CLICK) kept it all candid 
 An apple a day, we have FUN dip 
 I knew one dip, after school special delivery 
 She kept up on asses like Nancy Drew 
 We did a dance or two, until my girlfriend showed up 
 Bitchy Girl: 
 (Nigga I know you ain't disrespectin me who is this bitch?) 
 (Why is this bitch all in your face? Why is this bitch ALL, IN, YOUR, FACE) 
 (Yeah whatever nigga just dancin, I am not the numerical uno) 
 (So you got one night out and wanna act like a little monkey?) 
 (I know IT'S HARD OUT HERE FOR A CHIMP~!) 
 Pos: 
 Can I get a Soul Clap? 
 It's the summertime 1969 nigga, born durin the Woodstock 
 Many men do wish they could rock 
 But all they do is inject the value of shock 
 But KABOOM, I blow up the spot, the scene 
 The little ones, the teens, them elders, the peers 
 They don't run in fear, they gravitate 
 To the way I navigate know-how inside your ear 
 (Never) fabricate vo-cals inside your ear 
 And let's make it clear, I'm Plug (""one for the trouble"") 
 Wonder Why (""for the time"") 
 Workmatic, pullin them dimes 
 Who like to get on their knees and [WHISTLE BLOWS] 
 And [WHISTLE BLOWS] and [WHISTLE BLOWS] and [WHISTLE BLOWS] 
 And [WHISTLE BLOWS] and [WHISTLE BLOWS] and [WHISTLE BLOWS]

135,De La Soul,hiphop,What The Fuck N1,"Posdnuos: 
 Aiyyo this is the ""What the [BLEEP]"" portion of the tape 
 Where we play you, exclusive songs you never ever heard before 
 That didn't make the album, that's why y'knahmsayin so 
 This one is called ""De La Soul's Poster"" 
 It was recorded during the ""De La Soul is Dead"" album 
 So you ain't gonna hear it nowhere else 
 Check it out yo here it go 
 ""De La Soul's Poster"": 
 I was walkin' down the street to meet with my sweet 
 I'm not a wimp, but a shrimp, by the gangsta pimp 
 Actually I'm a kid with a limp, for my left leg was damaged 
 By some girls who managed to run me over 
 Over the fact De La Soul was in a shopping mall 
 The gall of the floozies 
 Though kids pose with no chains or uzis 
 Yo they're straight up weak 
 Now I made it to the end of the street, what do I spot 
 ... It made me drop my soda bop 
 To the beat y'all it seems my nightmare won't stop 
 I spot my girl and this cop 
 Gazin at a De La Soul poster on the side of a building 
 Was willing to forget it but my girl was singin' 
 Like a beaut' how cute Trugoy was 
 And if she was older how she'd be his boy 
 Was this somethin' I deserved 
 I'm a dedicated proom, only cheated once in a blue moon 
 And she's ready to quit me for some face on a wall 
 The cop gets a call and 
 He had to jet, bet the more man with a holster 
 Now I'm quick to face the troublesome poster 
 Pulled out a marker that I had stashed 
 Figured I'd give him a blue mustache 
 But with a dash I received a slash 
 From a fist, it was my girl fist at that 
 I knew what I was doin' would truly toast her 
 But didn't think she'd plug me for the De La Soul [needle drags] 
 (Inserted track ends) 
 ""What the, what the [BLEEP] was THAT!"" 
 Yeah exactly y'all 
 Yeah that was a little out whi-whi-whiggedy-Whoa~! 
 But ummmmm, yeah y'know that was that early 90's flow of mine 
 If you want to consider it a flow 
 I mean I think my flow was still baking in the oven 
 I don't even think the oven was on 
 Actually I don't think it was plugged up yet but 
 Ummmm, let's get into something where umm 
 The flow's a LITTLE bit better 
 Some current stuff right here for ya 
 Aight let's do it"
136,De La Soul,hiphop,Go Out And Get It,"I mean the only way that you gon' get it 
 Is to go out there and get it, y'knahmsayin? 
 It's like sometimes you gotta just put it all and bet the farm 
 You ain't gonna get it any other way, you know? 
 For me it's about bein better than I was yesterday, y'know 
 I'm sick and tired of bein sick and tired, I'm tired of losin 
 So I'ma bet it all, y'knahmsayin? 
 Pos: 
 All hail to the check one-two 
 You can catch one-two at a theatre near 
 Where you'll find me supportin rap, like a brassiere 
 Not sayin' if the game is tits, but you gotta admit 
 That the soul be the, holder of the mic device 
 Rhymes filled with blood and guts, the game filled with 
 Bolts and nuts, but them shits rusty 
 And the trusty MC got the W-4 
 You can find me up in the W. Moore 
 I'm back on the juice with them heavy-o Chevy rhymes 
 Missin' like crime on the deuce 
 We don't sit in boats and fish, we sit in studios 
 And quote words to serve on a dish 
 And the nerve that you wish you had I got bags of 
 And tracks are drugs that only make it worse when you're high 
 Listenin to the Why on the first verse named Wonder 
 So don't underestimate, what we create 
 And you'll never find us pullin up to clubs 
 In them long stretch whales 
 Or pushin inside girls with Donkey Kong stretch tails 
 And when all else fails, we hit 'em with the charm 
 That reflects like muscles on the arm 
 And even if crowded like food courts 
 We own home court advantage so we never feel alarmed 
 Dave: 
 It's eighty-six y'all, put your rap on pause 
 More milk on the mic than them pregnant broads 
 Nine times out the dime it's a penny on the floor 
 Same penny you walk around and ignore 
 See I'm the penny that'll have the deal closed 
 Turn that point nine nine into one point oh's 
 A millisecond you'll be needin in the race 
 That photo finish I ain't even see your face 
 I'm that one degree that made the Pisa lean 
 The one goal, one job, one aim and one team 
 That one good push that gave birth to your dream 
 That one good year, that one good beer 
 See you can hit the lotto with hope and a buck 
 But with 99 cents yo' ass is outta luck 
 Once upon a time, it's not once it ain't happen 
 One pop in the air does not mean you clappin 
 One rap hit does not mean you be rappin' 
 Although you bust rhymes, you ain't kill it ONE TIME~! 
 Never was to be in the first, just the second one 
 If you don't find me with mic, I'm mic checkin' one 
 One good pinch, and one good hunch 
 That's just one bad apple out the New York bunch 
 Got ones, but I want 2's 3's and 4's 
 I'm that one when you got one more"
137,De La Soul,hiphop,Respect,"Dave: 
 Hey yo I'm proud to be black y'all, wish I could bring Jay back 
 DJ put the needle to the haystack 
 Pump beats like eighty-six pumped crack 
 Raise the heat for the summer, we Fahrenheit 
 Banners like cash on your corner, papered and OD 
 Make your girl wanna shake in front of little ol' me 
 Even when I'm rock bottom still the most poppin' 
 Hold crops like John on the farm, then Johnny your Fox 
 Boxcutter clean cut stem from the PA 
 Not your everday outcast, we outlast 
 Used to bust a tommy gun, now I blast off with a check 
 Might as well, I done earned the respect 
 Pos: 
 Here to jumpstart the art again, the sparkplug W-O-N 
 I trouble your whole squad again 
 In a class by myself, so selfish in my ways 
 Shave my head bald, I'm too fly for tou-pes 
 Ain't nuttin sweet yet, never actin' bitter 
 Shut your spitter small fry, you too dry to wet me 
 And if you could, you think I'd really let you? 
 In and out the hood I get much respect DUE 
 Dave: 
 Got two [?] with Supa Dave bandana 
 Shut your camera lens and use your senses 
 Recognize it's Pos, Mase and me 
 Stressin R-E-S-P-E-C-T, see? 
 Pos: 
 Best believe it's official y'all 
 Rap's the new form of wrestling on mescaline tabs 
 And E pills, and y'all came back for refills 
 Watchin how the drama unfold 
 As MC's go from hot to cold 
 Pots of gold they search for 
 Some find more than others - platinum plaques 
 But when you act goes active on the radio 
 You become radioactive, that's a fact~! 
 De La's got the respect attack 
 Tactfully weathering the storm in all forms 
 We born to give you the breaks 
 Cause just like a fiend y'all came 
 So y'all can get rid of them shades"
138,De La Soul,hiphop,Beef,"Unknown guest poet: 
 Nah that's not what I mean 
 I mean, every mornin I wake up and I give thanks 
 Y'know, that I get dressed up and rob banks 
 I don't need a mask, I ain't askin for favors 
 Everybody got it rough 
 If you were the only one who had it bad 
 Then there would be a cause for effect, you hear me? 
 It's easy to live after the world's opinion 
 It's easy to live accordin to your own 
 And when she don't got love for you, man 
 She's like a loaf of bread with nuttin to drink 
 Goin' down hard, that's word up 
 She'll tear anything up for you 
 Shit is rough but it's fair man, ain't a joke out here 
 Niggaz been doin' good for a long time 
 But now the game has changed, y'knahmsayin? 
 We just came home, now we got BEEF~!"

 Posdnuos: 
 Who floats like a butterfly, sting like a bee 
 Not me! Leave that for that boxing great 
 Yet I float like b-balls on a path to swish 
 Sting like making shots when you're pissed 
 Of course that's sayin' you're on court to playin' a round 
 Unprotected blues and I'm the same bad news 
 You come pokin your face in my place 
 The rest you best believe you're gonna lose 
 I'll choose every line to floor ya 
 I'm a New York nigga, my momma and them from Waynesboro, Georgia 
 Wonder Why, I cop weed just to feed 
 To my ex-pectations to keep them high 
 Cause my own try to hold me back, with that black on black rhyme 
 Get off me blackie! Your whole style tacky 
 And lack the approach of men 
 You just a kitten in a lion's den, all right reverse it, aiyyo 
 Back up lil' nigga, reverse your steps 
 Back up lil' nigga, reverse your steps 
 Back up lil' nigga, reverse your steps 
 Reverse your steps, reverse your steps

 Back up lil' nigga (reverse your steps - REVERSED)

 Dove: 
 I box better when I'm on these ropes 
 And got bloody in the eighth but your apes couldn't save you 
 The left got brutal and ripped shack your ribs back 
 So now you sprayin the streets without eatin 
 My plate's got broccoli and snow peas on it 
 See we healthy like Lance Armstrong and then Popeye 
 Small fry fuckin' with these Spuds McKenzies 
 Get the bucks, get the money, and the bid or your Benji's 
 Radar heavy I analyze the blips 
 See me comin' in your land I'ma AND-1 this bitch 
 Ain't nuttin to lose but these two fronts, a few stunts 
 The Chuckers got strings on 'em, we airborne 
 Cleared for takeoff, face off the square puzzle 
 Got you puzzled like yo is it peace or piece? 
 Increase the blows for the stutter step to it 
 Make you jump back and kiss your death and step back!

 Yeah... it's De La 
 You know we up in here, just doin' what we gotta do 
 This joint right here we call ""Just Havin' a Ball"" 
 Just havin' a ball, y'know 
 See my lady really don't like me when I be 
 Sayin' the things I be sayin' in my rhymes but 
 You know I'm just havin' a ball 
 They say Dave got it bad for these broads on tour 
 These thick legs, Lego and Rubix Cube 
 Tyco, night glow, butt-ass nude 
 He got Monopoly's on 'em from the Bronx to the bank 
 Got the battle - ""He sank my Battleship!"" 
 I put a sock on my robot and box the all night 
 Play the head to head, never went all pro 
 At the halftime performance she the halftime show 
 A part time sucker, I implore the game (word up) 
 She quick to dodge-balls, avoidin the face stain 
 Jack-in-the-box, nah that ain't no haps 
 I need that Mrs. Potato Head in my lap 
 In checkers and chess I do a big cut bounce 
 36 ounces of hula hoop hips 
 I'm shootin for that Duck Hunt, that Dan Quayle tail 
 What I gotta spell it out? I'm about to campaign 
 For that President Bush, damn I declare war 
 Bring on some of your friends, matter fact, the next whore 
 Pos: 
 All right I'm tryin' to have a ball without all that girl talk 
 Cause my girl wouldn't like that either 
 So I'm I'm tryin' to stay away from that 
 Aww fuck it, I'm hot 
 Let me, let me do it, let me do it a lil' bit 
 Aiyyo ""Gimme That,"" that Lil' Webbie and Bun B 
 I used to mash Lil' Debbie up in 1-D 
 Those were the days, but days don't change 
 So we still get it on just to keep it all the same and it's 
 Routine to rock roll and rip shows 
 Across the zip codes and fold the thick loads 
 Of information inside your earlobes 
 We are the high end thread for your mere clothes 
 Outside of the box is where you'll find us 
 Those who find to it, step behind us 
 It's not about the lead, we not tryin' to be 
 The heir to the throne but the air that you breathe and it's 
 Protocol for us to get at y'all 
 With a face filled with game 
 We play without the cheat codes, we don't need those to rock 
 Close the do' in our face, best believe we gon' knock 
 Let us in y'all 
 Dave: 
 Yeah that's right 
 It's De La, that's how we do 
 We just have a ball every time we have a ball 
 Now make sure y'all look out 
 For the TV series, this is part one, ""The Impossible Mission"" 
 We gon' have two and three 
 Aiyyo Why, part two point five, hahaha 
 That's how we do it y'all 
 Shout out to my man Maseo 
 Shout out to my man Prince Paul 
 Shout out to everybody out there, De La family 
 You know how we do 
 Just havin' a ball, I just like talkin'

 (This, is, a, Supa Supa, blast blast, Supa Supa, blast blast) 
 Relax your mind, let your conscience be free 
 Get down girl, get down girl 
 Pos: 
 (Get dowwwn!) Just another day in a lonely world 
 Where I like to make a lonely girl 
 Feel a little less lonely, tell a tale where she's 
 My one and only, she got homegirls 
 Who likes to do more than chat 
 So she asked where my homies at, I mean that song was fly 
 But if my homey can't have none, sayin' I won't have fun 
 Is honestly just a God damned lie~! 
 Self-missions are less stress, and cut out the mess 
 Of havin' a girl, verifyin if I'm lyin' or not 
 With her girl, cause my niggaz occupyin the same spot with her 
 I'm like the fox with the fur well groomed 
 You find me in hot clubs and hotel rooms in between the sheet crack 
 And if the bed squeaks or noise-free, I'll put it to use 
 Swig from the tiger beers for the extra boost 
 Blow out your back like flames over the cake 
 Cut out a piece of your heart, for the claim 
 When I get you worked up to cream, and I can get on 
 Some Snoop Dogg shit and scream, ""What's my motherfuckin name?"" 
 (Chorus: w/ Erick Sermon ad lib samples) 
 Dave: 
 Hey, we in the position to renew things 
 I specialize in doin' me and you things 
 Now what's that he say she say? 
 We got mortgages, dump all this gossip you're hoardin 
 This world premier is for real ma 
 A catalogue of lovin' you can hear ma 
 Put the quarter in the jukebox 
 I brought a bit of luggage drawers and a few socks 
 A little Dane Dane, and some X-Clan 
 I'm tryin' to save you from the chores of the next man 
 See we can picnic, and go horseback 
 I love your laughter even if you sound like Horshack 
 You so impeccable but damn them birds peck at you 
 Your technique is cuttin' like you catch beats 
 Or def these nuts cause your sex speaks 
 We oughta ""Chill"" like EPMD 
 (Get dowwwwn!)"
143,De La Soul,hiphop,The Corner,"Dave: 
 Yeah, the 15 millionth time, 15 and 1 
 Check it out 
 Yo Com, how you rhyme to this slow shit 
 Yeah yeah, check it out 
 Yo memories of the corner, we huddled and stayed in trouble 
 Guzzled on 40 O-Z's and played the double and back 
 We doublin crack, no wonder why they fear us 
 We cussin cause our mommas couldn't hear us 
 Young lovers'll cuddle at 15 shit, they seen the struggle so 
 That makes him a man con-sidered he got plans but 
 She don't understand that this is where them fools bust at 
 Same corner where she go and catch the school bus at 
 It ain't changed a bit, we stand circle and spit bars 
 Cigarette butts scattered like glass shattered 
 And pops he play the corner till his day comes, DAMN~! 
 Ambulances on the corner but hey, now it's offi-cial 
 Cisco was the daze them cups of E&J 
 Went down and hit a warm spot even in the winter's cold 
 We had our snorkel and our winter playboys on 
 These are the corners we was sent to play boys on 
 Our socks is pockets, the guns is rockets 
 It's where the after school fight was at, brand new bikes was at 
 Fila suits, Kangols and new Nikes was at 
 Same corner is today's same yesterday 
 I wish that I cold give you this feelin' 
 I wish that I cold give you this feelin' 
 We was livin' on them corners, had a nigga rhymin, drinkin' 
 Whylin, potted out, livin' HIGH~! 
 Pos: 
 We live it real, hard, revoke your zeal 
 God don't come around here no mo' 
 So why you screamin HIS NAME in vain when the pain hits 
 Pick yourself up and get to a hospital quick 
 But leave out the bit, about what went down 
 I know they hound us for hawkin 
 Just a flesh wound, stitch it up, keep it walkin' 
 Niggaz on the corners loyal, they ain't talkin' (they ain't talkin') 
 Put down the sea of chalk and 
 The use of chalk is for lines of hopscotch 
 Or tracin dead bodies for crimes that got botched 
 For just crime committin and it's, time to fit it 
 In the schedule, cause them crosstown niggaz 
 Came to our corner sprayin that lead you pull 
 Ain't nuttin deeper than pilin in the car 
 With the streetsweeper so we can clear every star 
 Off the corner"
144,De La Soul,hiphop,What The Fuck N3,"Dove: 
 Aight, back to the ""What the [BLEEP]"" portion of the tape 
 Umm, this song right here we recorded... 
 In the middle of ""De La is Dead"" and ""3 Feet High and Rising"" 
 Think Pos called it ""De La Slow"" 
 Enjoy it, you're only gonna hear it here 
 Aight, peace 
 (""De La Slow"") 
 It's in 
 This is a ""De La Slow,"" type groove 
 Al's on the board 
 He's tired as hell 
 Prince Paul is out sleep 
 But it's still ""De La Slow"" 
 Got a WRMS radio station, that's ""De La Slow"" 
 We got a donut shop, that's ""De La Slow"" 
 We got props, that's ""De La Slow"" 
 And I gotta kick this rhyme, that's ""De La Slow"" 
 Preacherman rocks that nobody can 
 So don't get mad if you don't understand 
 Tracks hold dirt yet no infections 
 Heads won't swell 'cause we close a flow grip 
 Known as the madface through my teens 
 Never felt blue so I still wore jeans 
 The mighy mic cord plays the Plug One's sword 
 Invert if you don't want a hurt from a cut 
 There's nowhere to go from the saint to the hoe 
 They mighta passed the bread so I have a lot of dough 
 So the love is the rule like my man Lenny Kravitz 
 But girls wanna play me with the ""Oh she gotta have it"" 
 Naughty nutrition is served like these 
 And with the donuts we pass the peas 
 Makin' much dollars, grippin much jeans 
 Keep it undercover like a yellow submarine 
 ... 
 Dove: 
 Bogus, how bogus can I [farting noise] 
 (Inserted track ends) 
 ""What the, what the [BLEEP] was THAT!"" 
 Yeah [toilet bowl noise]

145,De La Soul,hiphop,Big Mouf,"(Posdnuos:) 
 Some say the game's real 
 'Cause The Man didn't give us manuals to the game to make it big 
 A corner boy tryna claim a smidge 
 To keep all the right foods in the fridge 
 Keep all the right dudes on the bridge 
 When I get in, the captian seek 
 Sorta like James Kirk, but my name's Work-MATIC 
 Here to adjust, the pros oppose to gettin' froze than economy plus 
 Link up with Erick and P. 
 And do a whole collabo together, called +The Joint+, business class 
 To run up in first so the biz can last 
 Instead, the biz went to hell and got infiltrated 
 By them mainstream infidels, so here to settle the score 
 Blow up the track to bits and leave nothing! 
 No clause or claim, provoking a fear or fame 
 Just know the name! It ain't De La, that's the group I'm in 
 It ain't old school, that's the truth I blend 
 And this will not be the realest shit I ever wrote 
 But more real than theirs, so what that say about the words THEY spoke? 
 I tell ya light and raw, you never find a black man with blue balls... 
 Like you hard, sell a load every area code 
 Domestic or inter-national, see that sounds a little un-rational 
 Watch your step, you might TRIP! 
 (Dave:) 
 Look out below, a nigga done fell in 
 These rhymes are for sell, but it ain't gun sellin 
 Tellin' tales as such, that's just for liars 
 Equipped with the hands to silence ya whole choir 
 Deny her! She the one who started this nonsense 
 Excuse me, I got issues of my consciences 
 Flip like Geminis, in fact, I am just a Virgo 
 Tee shot the bird to skeet skeets a burner to ya big mouf 
 You can find us in the big house, invitin you to the doorstep 
 Where the raw's kept, the fourth step, broke 
 I'm a take him if I got money on his mouth so I'm a move the cliff 
 The right route, we break bread and make bread 
 Charge a fam a fee for it's mistake bread 
 Good times, sometimes seem corrupt 
 I put my shell on the book so we movin on up 
 Confuse it all up, peep the rule of thumb 
 I got consent from a king so a bitch can't run 
 And beggars can't beg when the deaf don't hear 
 If I'm blind to the facts, I see your bullshit clear 
 And you been all year in my ear with your feathers 
 Peacockin the boy, we droppin' the boy 
 Inserts volumes, twenty are dances 
 It'll be sweet if you heard the advance... 
 Now bring the chorus in 
 (Chorus x2: Dave (Pos)) 
 SHOUT! Talk about it! Say somethin'! 
 (That's that SHIT right there!) 
 You heard that? LOUDER! It's the BIG MOUF! 
 (Posdnuos:) 
 The mirror shows me frowns when the money's tight 
 Sometime you gotta go LEFT to get the money right 
 And I'm NOT gonna be left behind 
 Fuck all your phonecalls, Merce has left the line 
 Whatever you need say, say it to Trent or Ray or Chris Ak, or Smilez 
 No longer wanna hear it, unless it's the files of the MP3 
 Gottin me to spit the P, with about five-letter Fs' attached 
 While you in your ride screamin'... 
 (YO, what the hell did he say?!) (Man, bring that back!) 
 A poor man's hope, a poor manhood 
 Back in your egghead like yo... 
 You niggas will NOT elude me! 
 Helpin you remember wire the first, you should include me 
 The Leo slash dragon, who pulled out the knife 
 And SLASHED all four tires on the bandwagon!"

 Tell me how you feel 
 Look over your shoulder 
 Time will make it real 
 Give me no excuses 
 I know how ya feel 
 Pain will make it better 
 Pain will make it better 
 Pain will make it better 
 Let me see how many palms go up high 
 If you've ever felt the world had you licked 
 And what you waving side to side to symbolize 
 Needing help on the sand put you under quick 
 Big mama said ""the Devil's up to no good"" 
 But we can heal it on a Sunday with a good book 
 Or we can kill it on a Monday for a good look 
 Make it part of the campaign, to withstand pain 
 Me, myself, place it all on my shoulders 
 And give it my all, like heavy lifting 
 No gain without tears and sweat 
 They claim blue skies with white clouds, steady drifting 
 When pain come to get ya, it hit ya like flu 
 Better times will pick ya, do what you gotta do 
 To earn focus in the stormy weather 
 Come out the tunnel to the light saying 
 Pain will make it better 
 Tell me how you feel 
 Look over your shoulder 
 Time will make it real 
 Give me no excuses 
 I know how ya feel 
 Pain will make it better 
 Pain will make it better 
 (I hear the people saying) 
 Pain will make it better 
 (I heard my people saying) 
 Pain will make it better 
 No wetter, four-letter, mo' better 
 Slow pain, no gain, go getta 
 Change like the weather 
 Solid as a rock, small piece of leather but well put together 
 Flames are endeavors 
 Time to find out that gain makes it better 
 Pain makes it better 
 Shades of epiphany, can't let it get to me 
 Move so differently, do it so swiftly 
 Ease into my style, lay mine down 
 King be crowned, look at me now 
 Teaching my classes by the masses 
 Used to gang bang, used to love the clashes 
 Now cash is the only motivation 
 But not for me G, I'm into public relations 
 That's food for your, De La Soul, word to the letter 
 Pain will make it better 
 Tell me how you feel 
 Look over your shoulder 
 Time will make it real 
 Give me no excuses 
 I know how ya feel 
 Pain will make it better 
 Pain will make it better 
 (I heard my nana say it say) 
 The bigger the headache, bigger the pill 
 The harder you fall, stronger the will 
 We came from the back of the bus, talking Watts to Mobile 
 Now we're on a house on a hill 
 Struggle went from filling ya gas tank 
 The bank wasn't feeling your loan 
 The OT couldn't cover the bills 
 When life came with a couple of spills 
 But we're gonna use that pain fo' fuel so 
 Give me no excuses 
 I know how ya feel 
 Pain will make it better 
 Pain will make it better 
 (I heard the people say) 
 Pain will make it better 
 (You and my people saying) 
 Pain will make it better

 Pain will make it better

 Yo, a slow burn we are 
 Last long three-man act to wake up your thermostat 
 Blind through the property line 
 Creative minds crossover and back 
 Scribble with a knife to earn that slice of life 
 Cock back, aim, shot the name wherever the price is right 
 The pain earned is the pain learned, and heads talking like burn 
 Connect (to the same as it ever was) 
 Respect the land 'cause it never floods and well irrigated 
 Looking for my vanity, it's there, the mirror hate it 
 And stated, stop being an MC and give your verses more weight 
 By being just M-E, thoughts are oxidized when I spit 'em out 
 And my lungs prefer tastes, encrypted words laced to get them out home 
 With removal service to get kings out the throne 
 (More hands on) With hands upon the neck 
 Of a voice magnifier over decks 
 The sound is found at the youngs in the batch 
 Lovely how I let my mind float 
 You can catch me in the early morning 
 Find me up with no yawning 
 Haven't been asleep, I'm on cue 
 8 in the corner pocket from the booth all 24 hours like it was our debut 
 Life edited my etiquette 
 Dreams beyond your eons 
 You can't wait this out 
 Start blitz, starring it's that crew who never call the splits convey lines made from outer spines 
 So the nerve of us to be so damned crush 
 Grit like JDL and we sip from the grail 
 Where the current course connects, so we're not unsung 
 Just vets, this mission's undone

 Yo, it's a honor and a pleasure 
 Rappers is not try to see me like a diamond tester 
 I'm on the low, I'm like a silent investor 
 Well dressed, my suit and vest is never polyester (never) 
 Keep a shottie on the dresser 
 My queen look like a young pepper 
 Up in her plump compress her 
 My tongue is forever under the weather, however 
 My heart was still lighter than a feather 
 Culturally, snort 'em like coca leaf 
 Them niggas suck more - no teeth 
 On the low though in my Polo tee 
 The show cost money but the promo's free 
 My pen collection is interesting 
 No steel, but still niggas will feel threatened 
 My genetics is comedic 
 Driven in lanes I was looking angelic 
 Psychedelic, if niggas like it I can sell it 
 But I don't fuck with that sweet shit, I'm diabetic 
 This is rapping at its peak 
 Your bird's steady yapping at the beat 
 Of a parakeet 
 You're not unique, you're no Kool Keith 
 Shit is more parrot-y (parody)

 New York City lights look better in July 
 4th, no fireworks will dangle in the sky 
 Like right there, feeling the night air 
 Promoting the fair fight 
 Square dance, men at the faceoff 
 Crooked eye letters from Madoff apologizing 
 Long journeys walking cold hard facts 
 Once you turn up there, there's no turning back 
 From Rock Co.Kane Flows to flows that are crack 
 In the hemline, versus on the land muddied your man 
 The hard work you threw on the scale, damn 
 I'm Joe Pesci on the Dish, so messy on the disk 
 Puerto Rican mamis call me ""flapi"" 
 Leap a tall feeling in a single bound 
 Way over your head like my ex-girl talking bout mind sex

 Decorate the paramount figures

 And it's easy to recall the good and fall into place 
 But you're not easy to love 
 I love the memory of... 
 I remember your face, I remember your way 
 I remember you now 
 Part of my existence 
 I remember your face 
 You came in and got me 
 All in a day 
 Yeah, all in a day 
 I remember your lips 
 Do you remember the taste? 
 Remember family names 
 Your child, my child, our child 
 Whitley and Dwayne 
 Different to my world now 
 Remember the ways 
 You gripped my hips so tight now? 
 Slow up the pace 
 Maybe erase, don't remember my waist 
 'Cause it's so easy to fall back to the memory of 
 And it's easy to recall the good and fall into place 
 But you're not easy to love 
 I love the memory of... 
 I remember your face, I remember your way 
 How could I forget? 
 A ballad was born upon a demo of a fly love song 
 Didn't take long before the archer with the wings heard it 
 Shot us in the heart with a contract, he knew we were a hit 
 The right amount of soul with a parallel amount of grit 
 But the archer couldn't see the target of departure 
 Gave in your pink slip and called it quits 
 It's understood you would 
 Label me the mate who wronged you 
 'Cause I kept wanting to feature 
 With them other females on they songs too 
 Your words spoken in mono for monogamy 
 Telling me I had to go 'cause I chose 
 Stereo for stereotypical male biology 
 And now I'm left setting traps 
 For you to fall in for me again 
 Who hates you to tell me 
 ""Slow up the pace, maybe erase, don't..."" 
 Slow up the pace 
 Maybe erase, don't remember my waist 
 'Cause it's so easy to fall back to the memory of 
 And it's easy to recall the good and fall into place 
 But you're not easy to love 
 I love the memory of... 
 Our last trip to Vegas had me feeling like we had a chance 
 But chance just showed up at the wedding 
 I guess I didn't read the heading 
 ""Forgivin' won't erase the bitter past"" 
 But I ain't up for kissing ass 
 I bought you everything your pretty feet could fit in 
 Put you behind the finest steering wheels 
 Fearing you would drive a nigga crazy 
 Told you grow up, but shit, you was my baby 
 Bits and pieces never made nothing decent 
 When I accommodated you, you played me like a stranger 
 I remember you now (Accountability is major) 
 A part of what I did then 
 Remember your face 
 Just don't let me trip over memory lane 
 'Cause time can't be replaced 
 And I don't want to stay 
 'Cause, oh, it's so easy to fall back to the memory of 
 And it's so dah-dah-dee-dah 
 Dah-dah-dah-dah-dee-dah 
 It's so easy to fall 
 In dah-dah-dah-dah-dee-dah

 Just to say that I cocked her (click, click) 
 My hardware is progressive 
 My sex crime language is leaning on obsessive

 But I'm over your stars screaming the moon ain't budging 
 Ain't from Hollis, don't need to tell you who is 
 But who it here raise hell, they be like ""you kid"" 
 I'm ambidextrous, liken to Dexter 
 Murderous lyrical blood splatter over the texture 
 We live by that code, not to regret living 
 Electric guitar sparks and ignites gun powder 
 A sabbath ain't black enough to call my bluff, bitch 
 The kill switch just turns it louder 
 You can save your soul 
 If we are no more 
 Suffer the consequences 
 We are the way the Lord intended 
 Fuck everyone 
 Burn everything 
 Leaving an impression not just a dented legacy 
 Fuck everyone 
 Burn everything you see 
 Not just clinging to the planet powerless to a void 
 That cataclysmic impact of a massive asteroid 
 (Fuck everyone, burn everything) 
 Fuck everyone, burn everything 
 Never to surrender to the cosmic schadenfreude of only 
 Meeting your creator on the day you are destroyed 
 (Fuck everyone, burn everything) 
 Just as the Lord intended 
 (Just as the Lord intended)

153,De La Soul,hiphop,Greyhounds,"Fresh from a bible belt town 
 That's what she's givin' up 
 Not really livin', just flesh comin' off a greyhound 
 That's what he think of her 
 Right at a blink of an eye he provides her with charm 
 Hides that he is a shark 
 Suggests a few apartments, never hints to the home 
 That's what he wanna do 
 She just wanna new zip code for an old dream 
 Lost in an appetite now the Big Apple might 
 Find her habit of a queen 
 Filled her an ego that's filled with illegal maps 
 Road Destination unknown 
 She's Little Bo Peep 
 And her and her whole sheep gonna have their wool unsewn 
 Now the wolf give a push 
 Now watch her jump in with two feet 
 Blue heat don't know how to swim through the limbs 
 Everyone huggin' her, tuggin' her 
 Ride on the merry-go-round of four drinks and two white lines 
 Go fast with the fast life so she needs more 
 One fun fix, now a daily chore 
 Provide the score, written and produced so perverse 
 He's a pro well versed 
 Told her that the purse that she want 
 With the shoes that she love and the rent that she need paid 
 She can earn with speed in a day 
 Escort on the high class side 
 Champagne glass rides 
 White snow waterfalls, oh how time flies 
 When you're flyin', crash and burn 
 She learned that her soul was dyin' 
 That's worth savin' 
 She's cravin' that bible belt town 
 So she crawls back on the Greyhound 
 Next stop, NYC 
 Take your seats please 
 I know exactly where you're goin', I can see it on your face 
 I know how to get there 
 And I give you my word that I get you there safe 
 I don't need to check your baggage 
 I don't need to know your name 
 All I need to know is 
 By the time you arrive, you'll forever be changed 
 Fresh new Gucci belt, bound 
 Fast to the city scape 
 Dash to deliver fate 
 Stashed in this duffel bag, proud 
 It's no scaredy cat 
 Life's always spared him that hand 
 That the gamblers fold 
 No chips if the scramble got cold 
 But them warm cushions and them soft bus seats 
 Push that second thought along 
 Beneath the roof of a Super 8, he sleeps till it's night time 
 Then connects in the streets like a pipe line 
 In dark shades he supplies dark brigades 
 Of lost souls with his chemical morsels 
 He's no lab tech 
 He was born into a legacy stretched from Aztecs and beyond 
 Assets he was drawn to 
 Had him spinnin' the wool over his mother's eye 
 He's the black sheep 
 His pops career driven, he's the backseat 
 The man on the wheel that cruises on sunrise 
 That the man bought eyes to his pay per view 
 Kind of paper make a fool shoot his staple through 
 And tape a label to 
 Until he's can bait 
 Until a pancake pocket's change the landscape 
 Take a short visit home in the town 
 It's time to re-up, it's back on the Greyhound 
 Next stop, NYC 
 Take your seats please 
 I know exactly where you're goin', I can see it on your face 
 I know how to get there 
 And I give you my word that I get you there safe 
 I don't need to check your baggage 
 I don't need to know your name 
 All I need to know is 
 By the time you arrive, you'll forever be changed 
 By the time you arrive, you'll forever be changed 
 By the time you arrive, you'll forever be changed 
 Forever be changed, forever be changed 
 So watch where you're goin' 
 And this food you're chosin' 
 I don't need to check your baggage 
 I don't need to know your name 
 All I need to know is 
 By the time you arrive you'll forever be changed 
 Forever be changed, be changed 
 You'll forever be changed"

157,De La Soul,hiphop,Whoodeeni,"Your music means everything to you 
 Bullet bring the gun, why pull it? 
 Shoot words to see who's full of it 
 We from the same place, land of the game face 
 Plug signs on the jackets 
 Give props, yo, like a Prop Joe package 
 It's illegal 
 How those kids can come from out of the slums and live so regal 
 Lose it all on a prayer to the ego 
 Before the loss we earn for the cause 
 Toast to the life though my liver won't endorse 
 Currently in time and my enzymes 
 Are in sync to digest the brink of Armageddon 
 The bedding's over the mattress we lay with the actress 
 For social media to swallow us 
 Watch them rap peers who don't reply back 
 'Cause they think we gonna snatch up their Twitter followers 
 That's some female type foolery 
 And your females like glue to it 
 She know it, the scent of a poet 
 Police buy restraint to cover all the angles 
 The opera of operations 
 Scene One got you and your crew all confident with courage 
 We'll be there, jump in your square, wreck it 
 You be like ""Check it, they stretched the shit into rectangles, damn!"" 
 Dance, freak, get out your seat 
 Show me that you is a real whoodeeni 
 Get loose y'all, work it out now 
 Everybody, everybody get down 
 Whoodeeni, whoodeeni, whoodeeni 
 Born institutionalized 
 My homie from N.O. found his crib with the roof on the side 
 FEMA asking for an address, but ain't no mailbox 
 Nothing left to do out here but to sell rocks 
 Now they got cellphones inside of the cell blocks 
 And my cousin on parole 'cause he sold Glocks 
 My cousin that sold stock 
 Told you we have more soul than James Brown 
 Wearing a gold watch that obviously don't work 
 Used to go home and rob niggas for homework 
 See if the chrome work 
 Might call your girl to see if my phone work 
 I'm a hood star and the trophy's a gold vert 
 Mouth full of gold teeth 
 Niggas might end up obsolete if I'm four deep 
 Real nigga for real bed full of new sheets 
 Bedroom floor filled up with the loose leafs 
 This is a war zone, me and a two-piece 
 Put another head on and make it a new piece 
 She be like ""ooh wee"", I be like ""ooh wee"" 
 I love myself so much I'm a groupie 
 Everybody know my verses is Pookie 
 Had 'em all strung out like it's a drug house 
 When I'm in the booth I'm MJ with his tongue out 
 When I'm in the booth I'm Kanye with a gun out 
 Run in your mom house 
 Then I'mma lean sideways and burn out 
 All natural, I hope you got the perm out 
 I've been straightening that shit 
 New niggas came and tried to hate on that shit 
 I'mma use it now, I ain't waiting on shit 
 Dance, freak, get out your seat 
 Show me that you is a real whoodeeni 
 Get loose y'all, work it out now 
 Everybody, everybody get down 
 Whoodeeni, whoodeeni, whoodeeni 
 Yo, big drawers, where the big drawers at? 
 I got a case of the little head controlling the big head thinking 
 Played Honest Abe in the back of a Lincoln 
 Chopped down a cherry, American Pie varied 
 Next day she was on my Snapchat sexting 
 Had her bunny hopping a quick ten seconds 
 Dear Lord, forgive a nigga, I've been down with doubt 
 Had the frog legs, now I'mma knock this piggie out 
 Now Dave like to cuddle, but Dave don't play that 
 Like Dave had the ring, listen, Dave ain't say that 
 Courtships to door steps for gettin' ass 
 And if it's one of my broads, keep your feet off the grass 
 Size eleven the gas 
 Mash that potato 'til we lay in the grass 
 She mellow like it's a picnic 
 If she the mermaid, give her the fish stick 
 First class flight, shoot her out to the district 
 Wait, cancel the stallion, hold your horses 
 Kickstart your life and cut your losses 
 Look how we did 'em, ma, your boy still got it 
 I quit drinking, I quit the narcotics 
 Life's a bitch, but she seeing a therapist 
 This hip-hop done really took care of us, huh 
 We got stoops and Van der Rohes to sit on 
 Bitcoins, Vivian Maiers to bid on 
 But we cautious 
 Never undermine the hate and turn the spell on your evil forces 
 But this ain't the cha-cha two-step 
 Been a rider ever since the Schwinn gooseneck 
 The buck stops here, ain't no 'who's next' 
 Dance, freak, get out your seat 
 Show me that you is a real whoodeeni 
 Get loose y'all, work it out now 
 Everybody, everybody get down 
 Whoodeeni, whoodeeni, whoodeeni"
158,De La Soul,hiphop,Nosed Up,"And in from the door steps a dumbass struts the fool's gold 
 Know-it-all, and you wear it well 
 Funk-less in full length 
 Too square to stand for anything 
 Somebody get that man a chair 
 No matter where you opt to sit, the opposite-attract law don't fit 
 Repel even the docile 
 Always showing your nostrils, got 'em hostile 
 The way you're so uppity, till someone barks on ya 
 You get puppy feet 
 Quite a laugh, cause you don't know half, but act like you own a puzzle 
 And everyone allegedly under you, begging just to guzzle from your fountain of fresh 
 (Hashtag) 
 Fuck outta here, they rather stay clear 
 Roll up the papers and pass 
 While you turn your nose from the smell 
 Like Stanley on Fridays 
 Saying we should stay off the grass 
 As if the lines you sniff is more healthy 
 Delusions of prestige is not where the health be 
 B, you need to get it together 
 But nah, here comes you, part Frank Drebin, part Mr. Magoo 
 Stay stepping into trouble 
 Oh so when you're repping for your bubble 
 But bubbles can get popped, exposed to reality 
 Watch the words that drop 
 There's not enough salary to cover the check 
 'Fore you're behind on cash 
 People can see you coming like 9/11 ash 
 Toxic till your last days 
 And with your shady maneuvers 
 No one will include you where they ass stays 
 Behold your royal highness of sinus 
 It's near 100 miles of running cause your nose needs plumbin' 
 Captain Nose-dive reporting for duty on the good ship Handkerchief, all aboard 
 And that goes for you too, Nostril-damus 
 He who knows nose 
 And from the from the rooty to the tooty he defines snooty 
 Somebody asked me the other day is the brother a brother 
 Does Kleenex wipe? 
 Yeah I see that 
 Like you got one eye on top of your third 
 A star is born but whose claimin' that birthright 
 At first sight you the well dressed Park Ave sachet 
 Acclimated to the scent of your own tail (the bullshit) 
 The same bull that rage when the buck stops 
 You'll be walkin' on clouds but that's a smoke machine 
 See your dineros can't buy bliss, you high fist then 
 Turn into you flippin' the bird 
 And every man under your wing 
 You build your nest egg but you was spoiled rotten 
 Forgotten you can get robbed of your fame 
 Beak out like pelicans 
 You relishin' the fact that you stand feet from stardom 
 You bargain astonishin' antiques in this modern way of livin' 
 So tight and not a half size forgivin', you takin' the piss 
 You got a butler in duplex 
 Them two Tecs and our God won't protect ya 
 Can't stay in them white gloves for too long Mr. Handyman 
 Canaries don't chirp in your candy land 
 Give them motherfuckin' pigeons a hug 
 And then he strolls through the valley of dark 
 Nincompoop, simpleton 
 Stranger to his own father 
 Seldom down to get down 
 And just never stays up 
 Well, I'm yours son 
 We talkin' up there like a satellite 
 Species: canis lupus, unfamiliar 
 What's happening, dog? 
 You smell more like pig to me 
 La-la-la-la-la 
 Do-do-do-do 
 Be careful with your nose bro 
 La-la-la-la-la 
 Do-do-do-do

 Hello, it's the Soul 
 Troopin in with the Jungle patrol 
 And this ones about the KO's, the knockouts out there 
 Who I call my buddy 
 Hold up (Wait a minute) 
 Pos: 
 Now just wait, we're gonna talk about Buddy on this plate 
 But before we let the herd out the gate 
 Make sure the levels are straight out the jungle 
 (The Jungle, the Jungle, the Brothers, the Brothers) 
 Afrika: 
 De La Soul, from the soul 
 Black medallions, no gold 
 Hangin' out with Pos, hangin' out with Mase 
 Buddy, buddy, buddy all in my face 
 Mike G: 
 For the lap, Jimbrowski must wear a cap 
 Just in case the young girl likes to clap 
 Ain't for the wind but before I begin 
 I initiate the buddy with a slap 
 Phife: 
 Now drop the beat, for the Phifer from A Tribe Called Quest 
 When I see Buddy, I will never half step 
 I'll just do her Tribal style and then jet 
 The Buddy that I like is to be sexy and nice 
 Just good enough for the one they call Phife 
 A brown skin Buddy with shoulder length hair 
 Nice firm breasts and a round dairy-aire 
 Q-Tip: 
 Now for the next, I'm the Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest 
 And when I quest for the Buddy, I don't fess 
 For my jimmy wants nothing but the best (the best) 
 The best (Ooh Wee!) 
 Let's stick out the jimmy and see what we can catch 
 (Stick 'em up, stick 'em up jimmy) 
 Next won't be needed unless (Jenny wanna get right to the flesh) 
 Afrika: 
 Dancin on the dance floor 
 Girl, it's you that I adore 
 Step off stage, they scream for more 
 Native Tongues got rhymes galore 
 Mike G: 
 Snap my fingers, make you mine 
 If not, I'll snap a second time 
 After that, I guarantee 
 You will be standing next to me 
 Afrika: 
 Fly buddy (buddy) don't you know you make me go nutty (nutty) 
 I'm so glad that you're not a fuddy duddy (duddy) 
 Not too skinny and not too chubby (chubby) 
 Soft like silly putty 
 Miss Crabtree (Crabtree) I hope that you're not mad at me 
 'Cause I told you that it was your buddy (buddy) 
 That was making me ever so horny (horny) 
 Junglelistically horny 
 Pos: 
 I won't lie, I love B-U-D-D-Y 
 'Cause I never let it walk on by 
 When it comes to me and Jenny, I seem (very serious) 
 Like a big friend 
 Buddy is an act that occurs on the lip 
 When Jenny and Jimmy start shootin the gift 
 Boy let me get shot, I won't even riff 
 Dove: 
 On the dial, my Buddy talks to me for a while 
 Plug Two is the (Q-Tip: Q to her Tip) 
 On the A-side or sometimes the flip (word up) 
 Buddy, is the bud to my daisy tree 
 And the luuden to my do-re-mi 
 And the pleaser to my man Plug Three 
 (Plug Three gets the whole caboodle) 
 Mike G: 
 Behind my bush, my Buddy likes the way that I push 
 And like a champ, just knock it on out 
 Never ever once sellin out (Well let loose the juice) 
 My Buddy helps me to (De La my Soul) 
 Keepin' Jimmy in total control 
 Without Buddy, I'd be on a roll 
 Monie Love: 
 Now as the lady 
 I thought that Jungle and Quest and Soul would just maybe 
 Give me the chance to say that I get crazy 
 Due to the fact I let Buddy amaze me 
 As a matter of fact, it pleases me in many ways 
 I decided that it was time for Monie Love to say 
 That when it comes to the three, you know that I don't play 
 'Cause to me chasin Buddy is the perfect way (perfect way) 
 To spend the day (to spend the day) 
 Q-Tip and Queen Latifah: 
 Ooh child, things are gettin' a little easier 
 Ooh Buddy gets easier (yeah) 
 Ooh child, things are gettin' a little easier 
 Ooh Buddy gets easier 
 Q-Tip: 
 Girl, I heard you're lookin' for some good times 
 If you Quest from the Soul, here's what we'll find 
 Whole lotta fun, lots of fun together 
 Just like kissin' cousins (Yeah, that's kinda clever) 
 Close like bosoms, bosoms stay close 
 If you be my Buddy, I won't toast 
 That we're like Ethel Mertz and Lucille MacGillicuddy 
 You can be mine and I can be your Buddy 
 Dove: 
 The best Buddy's in evening wear 
 Long lovin' less Tru know (he's in there) 
 I feel sorry for those who pay a fare (a fee?) 
 Word to the D 
 I don't beg, I just tease my Buddy with my right leg (ha-ha) 
 And when it's ready what's said is Buddy is best in bed (Word to the D) 
 Afrika: 
 Buddy buddy told us all to get into a circle 
 Said don't bug because I won't hurt you 
 All I really wanna do is freak you (You know what? She freaked us) 
 Mike G: 
 And I watched and then I checked my Swatch to see the time 
 The Soul had formed a Buddy line 
 And that Buddy was mine, all mine 
 Pos: 
 Now when Quest, Jungle and De La Soul 
 Is at the club, our ritual unfolds 
 Grab our bones and start swingin' our hands 
 (Then Jenny start flockin in everywhere) 
 'Cause Jennifer just wants to stay aware 
 Yo fellas, should we keep her aware

 Keep it raw like the z ave crew, true

 We came to thank kids, not the blankets, but the towel 
 Shed love with the verb and the vowel 
 Move grooves like a bowel, de la representer 
 See funky is the way we keep it settin in your dreams like that 
 Teah yeah, gonna keep it real for the apartments in your area 
 Yeah, gonna move it like this everybody just funk in your area

 Ay yo, I flaunt gets way beyond the bets 
 Little girl be cheesin' when I'm twirling her barrettes 
 I'm entering through the centre in 'cause she sweats 
 Now her Mister needs to see if my construction can be kept 
 I run it back to when I had Millie in the sack 
 Where she did the nothing 'cause her father showed her something 
 I ain't frontin', I'm mashing all the comp 'cause I'm thorough 
 Like crack, that's here to clear the inner city boroughs 
 But jump inside your mind so there's no escapism 
 Yo, De La Soul is here to stay like racism 
 You wack-ass rappers, they don't take much to see 
 If you don't sync with my mental 
 What the fuck makes you think you can touch me? 
 Well anyway, I'm levelling the masses, which gets me asses 
 Now tell me who be the tramp 
 Hey yo honey, what the fuck you riffin' about? 
 Love should have brought me home but sex kept me out 
 Love should have brought me home but sex kept me out 
 Love should have brought me home but sex kept me out 
 Hey yo honey, what the fuck you riffin' about? 
 Love should have brought me home but sex kept me out

166,De La Soul,hiphop,Get Away,"I want to give y'all a little announcement man 
 For the last year there's been a lot of music comin' out 
 The shit been weak, knowhatI'msayin? 
 A lot of niggas trying to take hip-hop 
 And make that shit R&B, rap and bullshit yaknowhatI'msayin? 
 Or make that shit funk 
 Fuck that, this is MCin' right here, this is hip-hop 
 And like the Wu we bring it to you in the purest form 
 We reside far away from the norms 
 Spawn from the big catch, big bang, big breaks 
 Fetch pads and pens, even with the pencil 
 Rap labels studied us, flooded us with stencil 
 That's tinseltown, murder your display 
 And we stay flying even with the terrorists' trying 
 This to that town, monitor the pat down 
 Searching for controlled substance with sustenance 
 We inventors of the drug, ever since 
 Day-glo covers, broke pots, green balloons 
 The black shirt saying stakes, elevated noon 
 AOI, grind, you hear it 
 Understand we steer it 
 Some choose to veer it off the course 
 The main source missing 
 You've paid no dues, you've earned no pension 
 Learn the rules! You can either be the pimp 
 Or the pimped out tools 
 Wack niggas need not forget 
 Stop running up on niggas with 
 All that wack shit (Word up man) 
 Talkin' 'bout you emcee 
 You ain't no emcee 
 Like me 
 I bake works of art 
 While labels worry 'bout artwork 
 Or top of the chart perks 
 You need to insert a lot more of that 
 Original tier, that you can't manage 
 Just causes damage so just go, get away from here 
 You're fuckin' the game up 
 Too low to aim up so just go, get away from here 
 And some'll believe that they're leaders 
 Young fella you're a two liter 
 Simply waterway drowning out the source 
 This lesson is aligned with an underground cause 
 So sharpen your paper mate, my number twos'll make the beacon shine 
 And you *sound effects* 
 The fine lining is detail, the garment is retail 
 But I don't buy rap or excuses 
 The code used to be an unspoken device 
 But since that's gone you see what rap produces 
 (Y'knahmsayin'?) 
 The one on one, two on twos 
 Assemble in the center of squares like statues (Word up!) 
 Understand I just do this I don't have to 
 (Y'knahmsayin' this is hip-hop right here!) 
 (Y'knahmsayin' this is lyrics!) 
 But you wouldn't know that feeling if it slapped you 
 Like new credit, the blood work's indebted 
 Microphone donor, two pints of get right 
 I got my cardio up my nigga 
 Don't give a damn about a party 
 I do it for the body 
 Upchuck your mandibles, the scrambler's back 
 Since the two inch tape how ample is that? 
 Like furry dice hanging off the mirror 
 Your position is concerning my vision 
 These objects seem to be closer than they appear 
 And they could never catch us their directions don't match up 
 Just go, get away from here 
 You're jamming the lane up 
 Messing the game up 
 Just go, get away from here"

 Yeah... Check the vibe y'all, vibe y'all... 
 (Vibes... Vibrations...) 
 Dirty, rotten tooth 
 Select from the sound booth 
 Collect grammar 
 Like panhandlers 
 On skid row 
 My John Doe'll 
 Build a vision where thought can go walking 
 Without the Devil hawking 
 Stakes Is High like weed smoke 
 We need folk 
 To shed the truth 
 To the wide youth 
 *Truth Enola:* 
 Enola got soul 
 To hell with role models, teachers and guardians 
 With rock-hard erections, and seven incisions 
 Raw intercourse with mother nature 
 She likes to bang to the left 
 Teach all women and children only the best 
 Stakes is Higher than the highest mountain 
 Mos Def 
 *Mos Def:* 
 This is the 21st century, poor shit ain't quaint 
 The Zulu Apaches got battle cries and war paint 
 I do with some care 'cause I is who they ain't 
 That ain't strokin' my sack, it's just a black ink fat 
 Boy, ain't no keeping me back. Yes, Mos Def is the handle 
 Try to test and get suppressed like a government scandle 
 Exhibit is exquisit and a level degrees 
 Flying high in the sky with the Supa Emcees 
 *Posdnuos:* 
 Yo! I write rhymes like I come from New York City 
 Rollin' with commitees, making your whole life shitty 
 Shutting down your rap group, and you best to believe 
 Brothers become permanent niggas when they soul is a track 
 And ain't no niggas like the one I know 
 'Cause what I know is them niggas gotta go 
 Make me feel I need to by a fo-fo 
 (Bloop Bloop) Sending them express to hell though 
 *Mos Def:* 
 Classic material like Run DMC. At least 
 Four out of five, every Jeep owner agrees 
 That it's them damn high Stakes 
 That make you pump yo' brakes (vibes) 
 Pump yo' brakes (vibes) 
 Pump yo' brakes (vibes, vibes)

 Doctor, I'mma make those house calls and exercise those 
 Some people getting burned, playing their toes close 
 Fumble-eye sky tumble-ing down, stay humble-eye 
 Sidle up and ride. Beware, who you idolize 
 Religious hypocrites who give away elbow in the face 
 I'm Enola, system solar, Plug One, solely mine 
 *Posdnuos:* 
 We went from picking noses to pockets, directly to jail 
 Now we think we better ourselves trying to be calm 
 When you're puffing that (hay!) in the middle of the barn 
 Stopping thoughts, so you can stretch a mind into yarn 
 Funeral lawns are drunk from kids pouring out liquor 
 Respecting life, by met up with a little quicker 
 And we let the body rock the party 
 Until the party rocks the body 
 Cause a scuffle broke loose due to too much juice and gin 
 Run in the minds of opposing men 
 *Trugoy:* 
 Aiyo, my mens is going to have to learn when to say when 
 And when to ask why, you accept the (?) 
 Cause you dwelling in a sty 
 Can't face it man to man, son, I see it in your eye 
 Conseal it, why try? Display it, when you relay it 
 You're just a lie 
 (Vibes... Vibrations...) 
 *Posdnuos:* 
 There was a lovely lady who's intent I thought I had on Rosa Parks 
 But her ex came to town and took back her heart 
 And she left me standing silly in the dark with a mic 
 Caught up in expressions 
 And learning lessons of depression 
 Sometimes it seems I can't connect with female beings 
 To my little Aya-Mo when she having them dreams 
 And her facial gleams are sweet, but soon to switch to bitter 
 'Cause when she reaches sixteen she'll be considered a piece of meat 
 Not a treat but a trick to sex in showers 
 People kick last days, we in the last hours 
 Minutes and seconds, I reckon it won't be long 
 Till recorded ways of striving will be dead and gone 
 But this loss coming through despite who try to see me 
 These brothers are too hard, sisters are too easy 
 Sleazy... 
 *Mos Def:* 
 Trying to please me with that sex appeal 
 When you're livin' in the ghetto man you got to deal 
 Brothers scatter from the function when they spot the steel 
 Weapons get concealed, when there's plots to kill 
 The on all up in the party cause this rock is real 
 Niggas ain't stoppin' to think so they ain't gon' stop the violence 
 Music too loud to hear, so Doug E. Fresh say ""Silence!"" 
 Through the projects, they terminate and expect violence 
 I rather take it easy, keep it breezy like the Attic 
 *Truth Enola:* 
 Revi-revolutionize 
 We keep it complex, so don't offend 
 Nine times out of ten, men and women pretend 
 And mobilize devil eyes 
 Fight beside (?), you are the type 
 For everything in life has a price 
 Love black berry molasses 
 So smart you're stupid 
 Hard heads create soft asses 
 *Trugoy:* 
 So like molasses... 
 That's how you move, and how we prove with that 
 Come with the full-pack, to keep it native 
 Like tongues, we brung the lickin' for all your earth spittins 
 Can't write without that excite 
 But when you come down, you're shit is dumbfound 
 Sounded weak like mundane, someday 
 You figure one day, you'll play the roles of masterpiece 
 Until then cease 
 And I'm out like reece

 To get some Reese's Pieces 
 Peace

 Check the...

170,De La Soul,hiphop,Stix Stonz,"Chorus: all 
 If you can dig it, deal with it, if you can't, just forget it 
 Cause nobody rocks the party like we 
 Get loose, get loose, sunshine get loose 
 Just rock, and show 'em you got juice 
 And have, have, have, have, have, have, have fuuuuuuun! 
 Verse 1: la sunshine 
 I know it's been a while since the last time 
 You're heard la sunshine pick up the microphone and rhyme 
 But now I think it's time to go for mine 
 So you can sit back, relax, just max and unwind 
 Because it's time for me to out a few heads to bed 
 Because I'm upset at what somebody said 
 I've heard it through the grapevine it's been said 
 That sunshine, can't rhyme? 
 Ha! that's the funniest line that I heard in a long time 
 The wanna be me's that they I sound off beat 
 I'm not off beat, I'm totally unique and it sounds real sweet 
 So if you're ready, get set for a trip to the sun 
 You'll be guided, and I've decided to become 
 One to take total control of your soul 
 Young or all be bold because it's a sight to behold 
 Sticks and stones might break your bones but pos is gonna blow your mind 
 Ain't no need to hold it (let it go!) just one more time! 
 Verse 2: posdnuos 
 Now you can bet that I'm first kick a watt 
 Soul son, plug one, posdnuos I'm top notch 
 Forward, backstep, got cabbage on the brain 
 So I'm leafy, peasy, and I act kind of sane 
 So homeboys and girls just come follow me 
 I'm the fried pipe piper down with dub and plug three 
 I like my man's, freestyle is not my flow 
 But I gets mad respect from norfolk to glasgow 
 I run this up to court about a minute to the sec 
 Cause my hoodie won't clash with whipper whip's mockneck 
 So my hip-hop teachers please show me the math 
 And after this give me your goddamn autograph 
 Whipper whip, you can make the microphone sing 
 Walking around sporting your diamond ring 
 All the ladies know you as an MC king 
 So get on the mic and tell 'em it ain't no thing 
 Verse 3: whipper whip 
 Well the prince is my title and, I do what I must do 
 When rappers get beside themselves, that's when I bust two 
 Or three, see it doesn't matter to me 
 Cause the w-h-i-p's got an army 
 Whipper whip, the whipster, money gripster 
 Can't stand the tipster unless she got the hips to 
 Move a mountain, left on kingsly and fountain 
 1345 is where I used to count them 
 The grips in my bucket's the kind that choke horses 
 No more losses and no toy mosses 
 It's the kings of kingsly, from bronx to Hollywood 
 I'm whipper whip, I but the g in ""good"" 
 Yo I can blow like a whistle, run far beyond average 
 Been rapping to the man like randy savage 
 You be the judge, come stand as I slam some 
 There's open invitation to all and then some 
 Sticks and stones might break your bones but jd dub is gonna blow your mind 
 Ain't no need to hold it (let it go!) just one more time! 
 Verse 4: dove 
 I kick the chatanooga choo choo so listen to the calling 
 Next stop's the body rock, here's the ticket to my clock 
 It's the flips, but keep your jaws on your hips 
 >From back in the days I used to air it to the hits 
 Earn the dance step and guaranteed to play the wheel to wheel 
 And wild style was the real, dig it? 
 I block the heckles and hecks and gets nuff respects 
 Without the ""bah diddy bah"" I couldn't go and cash checks 
 DJ mase, since you got the bass, why don't you hit it, hit it? 
 Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it! 
 The do re, the mi phi, the sol la, the tito 
 Rocking it, rocking it, yes he is rocking it 
 Tito, rocking it! 
 Verse 5: tito 
 Smiggity smoking, no joking, turning styles like a token 
 No singer, but swinging rap lyric like a ringer 
 I'm solo, like bobo, breaking backs like bolo 
 No kitten, no hitting booby traps for the sitting 
 Ducks should I mention rhyme breezing like benson 
 Or hedges, I'm fuming autographs for the human 
 Being, I'm g-ing, off like keying 
 Or keenan, live ivory, waynan, who's slaying? 
 A TV or movie, hit singles often move me 
 Like groove me, they got me lingers like a ? ? ? 
 No slipping, no tripping on me while I'm ripping 
 Slam dunking like a donut on the bulls scottie pippen 
 A vocab that's no fad, I'm heftier than glad bags 
 My son's about 2, buckaroo and yelling ""go dad!"" 
 Sticks and stones might break your bones but superstar's blows your mind 
 Ain't no need to hold it (let it go!) just one more time! 
 Verse 6: superstar 
 I get the honor to rap with some old school greats 
 Caz, whipper whip, tito, and la 
 Maseo, posdnuos, trug, they from the new school 
 A perfect blend from the old and new 
 Superstar, where did I fit in? how did I get in? 
 Where did I begin, sin? 
 I'm known from belcourt to freeport, not a west coast or five boroughs 
 Yeah, my name's whispered in the ghettos 
 When I'm on stage, I write a book, flip a page 
 Write a chapter, and leave a hell of a phrase 
 Now, before I go, you know that I'm a pro, yo 
 You won't forget me, why, because I flow 
 So gmc, ha, gmc, ha ha, gmc ha, gmc, ha ha 
 Gmc, ha huh! (yo my throat is sore) 
 Yo, get on the mic, stay on the mic (dammit) 
 Rock on the mic with your rhymes galore! 
 Verse 7: grandmaster caz 
 Well I'm a black act back to attack the wack new jack 
 Smack the sad sack track with the stack of facts 
 True old data, see you later alligator 
 Raid or raider darth vader, 'cause I'm greater or rater 
 Made a plate of soul food, barbequed a rude dude with the attitude 
 Who got screwed 'cause he chewed 
 But I'm a writer, you can't take a bite of 
 So light up your lighter and watch me recite a 
 Dope verse or two with the curse or two, yeah rehearse a cue 
 But first a few minutes of funk, preferably seven 
 Microphones, all I need is one 
 MC's to school, ten or eleven then a bottle of don 
 When the job is done, but don't stop me now 
 I'm on a roll, control the whole stroll 
 And bowl the whole toll, fold the known souls 
 Patrol shoot the fruit, toot toot the hoot 
 Scoot with the loot and knock a cute suit boots 
 Entertain your brain like kane, not strain to maintain my main (shit) stain 
 Walls record us, break through the borders 
 All the manslaughters and kidnap daughters 
 Who are building and chlling in the building with a villain 
 I'm killing and illing but still in like bob dylan 
 I'm democratic emphatic erratic static I'm good at it 
 And suckers get gatted with the automatic 
 Rhymes are plenty, styles are many 
 Yeah, and that's as real as jimmy sticking jenny 
 If anybody knows a trick to slip my wig 
 With a lick or real sick with a lyrical brick 
 He's a vick bound to get tracked off 
 Step to the grandest and you'll get slapped off 
 Stage, and thoroughly stomped with the quickness 
 Now can I get a witness, 'cause I'm out"
