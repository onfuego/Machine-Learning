39,The Doors,rock,Celebration Of The Lizard (An Experiment/Work In Progress),"Lions in the street and roaming 
 Dogs in heat, rabid, foaming 
 A beast caged in the heart of a city 
 The body of his mother 
 Rotting in the summer ground 
 He fled the town 
 He went down South and crossed the border 
 Left chaos and disorder 
 Back there over his shoulder 
 One morning he awoke in a green hotel 
 With a strange creature groaning beside him 
 Sweat oozed from its shining skin 
 Is everybody in? Is everybody in? 
 Is everybody in? 
 The ceremony is about to begin 
 Wake up! 
 You can't remember where it was 
 Had this dream stopped? 
 The snake was pale gold, glazed and shrunken 
 We were afraid to touch it 
 The sheets were hot dead prisms 
 And she was beside me 
 Old, she's no, young 
 Her dark red hair, the white soft skin 
 Now, run to the mirror in the bathroom 
 Look! she's coming in here 
 I can't live through each slow century of her moving 
 I let my cheek slide down, the cool smooth tile 
 Feel the good cold stinging blood 
 The smooth hissing snakes of rain 
 Once I had a little game 
 I liked to crawl back in my brain 
 I think you know, the game I mean 
 I mean the game, called, 'Go insane' 
 You should try this little game 
 Just close your eyes forget your name 
 Forget the world, forget the people 
 And we'll erect, a different steeple 
 This little game is fun to do 
 Just close your eyes, no way to lose 
 And I'm right there, I'm going too 
 Release control, we're breaking through 
 Way back deep into the brain 
 Back where there's never any pain 
 And the rain falls gently on the town 
 And over the heads of all of us 
 And in the labyrinth of streams 
 Beneath, the quiet unearthly presence of 
 Gentle hill dwellers, in the gentle hills around 
 Reptiles abounding 
 Fossils, caves, cool air heights 
 Each house repeats a mold, windows rolled 
 Beast car locked in against morning 
 All now sleeping 
 Rugs silent, mirrors vacant 
 Dust Lying under the beds of lawful couples 
 Wound in sheets 
 And daughters, smug 
 With semen eyes in their nipples 
 Wait 
 There's been a slaughter here 
 Don't stop to speak or look around 
 Your gloves and fan are on the ground 
 We're getting out of town, we're going on the run 
 And you're the one I want to come 
 Not to touch the earth 
 Not to see the sun 
 Nothing left to do, but 
 Run, run, run 
 Let's run, let's run 
 House upon the hill, moon is lying still 
 Shadows of the trees 
 Witnessing the wild breeze 
 C'mon baby run with me 
 Let's run 
 Run with me 
 Run with me 
 Run with me 
 Let's run 
 The mansion is warm at the top of the hill 
 Rich are the rooms and the comforts there 
 Red are the arms of luxuriant chairs 
 And you won't know a thing till you get inside 
 Dead President's corpse in the driver's car 
 The engine runs on glue and tar 
 C'mon along, we're not going very far 
 To the East to meet the Czar 
 Run with me 
 Run with me 
 Run with me 
 Let's run 
 Some outlaws lived by the side of the lake 
 The minister's daughter's in love with the snake 
 Who lives in a well by the side of the road 
 Wake up, girl! We're almost home 
 We should see the gates by mornin' 
 We should be inside by evening 
 Sun, sun, sun 
 Burn, burn, burn 
 Burn, burn, burn 
 I will get you 
 Soon, soon, soon 
 I am the lizard king 
 I can do anything 
 We came down 
 The rivers and highways 
 We came down from 
 Forests and falls 
 We came down from 
 Carson and Springfield 
 We came down from 
 Phoenix enthralled 
 And I can tell you 
 The names of the Kingdom 
 I can tell you 
 The things that you know 
 Listening for a fistful of silence 
 Climbing valleys into the shade 
 For seven years, I dwelt 
 In the loose palace of exile 
 Playing strange games with the girls of the island 
 Now, I have come again 
 To the land of the fair and the strong and the wise 
 Brothers and sisters of the pale forest 
 Children of night 
 Who among you will run with the hunt? 
 Now night arrives with her purple legion 
 Retire now to your tents and to your dreams 
 Tomorrow we enter the town of my birth 
 I want to be ready"

 Look, we've just got a couple of little things that we've gotta tell you about. 
 The fire-marshal is not gonna let this show go on, 
 And I just had a long meeting with him, and man, 
 This is no joke, you either gotta sit down, and you gotta go back to your seats, 
 You gotta make isles, and that's it man. You gotta move back. 
 Hey look! Hey look! 
 Wait a second, hold on! Let's have a little help, man.

56,The Doors,rock,Who Do You Love,"Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I walked 47 miles on barbed-wire, 
 Cobra-snake for a necktie. 
 Built a house by the roadside, 
 Made of rattlesnake hide. 
 Brand new chimney up on top, 
 Made out of human skulls. 
 Come on baby take a walk with me, 
 Tell me who do you love? 
 Who do you love, now? 
 Who do you love, now? 
 Who do you love, babe? 
 I say: who now, who do you love? 
 Tombstone head and a graveyard mind, 
 Just 22 and I don't mind dying. 
 Rode around the town with a rattlesnake whip, 
 Come on baby don't give me no lip. 
 Who do you love, now? 
 Who do you love? 
 Who do you love, child? 
 I said: who, baby, who do you love? 
 Night is dark, the sky was blue, 
 Down the alley the ice wagon flew. 
 Hit a bump, somebody screamed, 
 You should have heard just what I seen. 
 Do you love me, babe? 
 Do you love her, yeah 
 Do you love me, babe? 
 Do you love it, yeah

76,The Doors,rock,Land Ho!,"Grandma loved a sailor who sailed the frozen sea 
 Grandpa was that whaler and he took me on his knee 
 He said, ""Son, I'm goin' crazy from livin' on the land 
 Got to find my shipmates and walk on foreign sands."" 
 This old man was graceful, with silver in his smile 
 He smoked a briar pipe and he walked for country miles 
 Singing songs of shady sisters and old-time liberty 
 Songs of love and songs of death and songs to set men free 
 I've got three ships and sixty men 
 A course for ports unread 
 I'll stand at mast, let north winds blow 
 Till half of us are dead 
 Land ho! 
 Well, if I get my hands on a dollar bill 
 Gonna buy a bottle and drink my fill 
 If I get my hands on a number five 
 Gonna skin that little girl alive 
 If I get my hands on a number two 
 Come back home and marry you 
 Marry you 
 Marry you 
 All right! 
 Yeah, land ho 
 Yeah, land ho 
 Well, if I get back home 
 And I feel all right 
 You know I'm gonna love you tonight 
 Love tonight 
 Love tonight 
 Yeah, land ho!"

 Takin' it easy, I was havin' some fun 
 Loafin' anda jokin' it was all energy 
 No such thing as you and or me 
 No time, you are mine 
 In the eye of the sun before the world had begun 
 It had been alot of work the last time around 
 Needed a rest, a chance to just lie down 
 Always on the go, no time to kill 
 Alot of runnin' to and fro hard working in the mill 
 So it blew up and I threw up 
 Into the eye of the sun before the world had begun 
 Well I hung around, don't know how many years 
 No more troubles, no more fears 
 Had alot of rest w/nothing to do 
 But I got kinda bored with nothin' to do 
 I wanted flesh and blood, skin and bones 
 Multidimensional, universal home 
 I was space and time up and down 
 Live and dead, blood all around 
 I knew there'd be trouble, but I could pull through 
 So I thought of the world and humans too."

 I said can I help it if I dig multiplicity

 Watch out, don't fall! Careful, don't slip! 
 You better get your balance, you have to feel the way 
 There are no more questions, no answers today 
 There are no reasons, there are no more rhymes 
 But if you feel it, you can fly next time 
 You can fly next time, or maybe this time 
 Did you think we were all together? 
 Did you think we were all the same? 
 Did you think maybe I could help you 
 Remember your name, remember the game 
 What's the name of the game 
 It's a very good game, never stays the same 
 It's the number one from mud to sun 
 You're on a tightrope ride, we're all by your side 
 But you're all alone, and we're going home 
 And we're by your side, but you're all alone

 On a tightrope ride"

 I left my body somewhere down the line 
 It's just so easy to lose track of time 
 You know it just done slipped my mind 
 You know it just done slipped my mind 
 It wouldn't matter but it's time to meditate 
 You know it just done slipped my mind 
 My memories undefined 
 They must haved spiked my wine 
 Because it just done slipped my mind 
 My mind and body are still out of tune 
 I hope they run into each other real soon

 I wouldn't mind but it's cold here on the moon

117,The Doors,rock,The Peking King And The New York Queen,"Well I heard a story, you can judge it's worth 
 About the sun and the moon the time they came down to earth 
 They pass in the heavens each day up above 
 Time after time they soon became old 
 They could not touch, they could not kiss 
 They had no flesh, no earthly bliss 
 So they made a scheme, they made a plan 
 They would come down to earth as a woman and a man 
 And took human forms to live out a dream 
 The most beautiful people that I've ever seen 
 They were the Peking king and the New York queen 
 I said the Peking king and the New York queen 
 As fate would have it it was a toss of a dice 
 They went to opposite ends of this world with our lives 
 Opposite eyes, opposite minds 
 Such things matter in these troubled times 
 ""We read a book from right to left"" 
 ""You read a book from the left to the right!"" 
 ""We see a rabbit in the moon"" 
 ""When you look at the moon, It's a man on the moon"" 
 ""Raw fish is very tasty, thank you"" 
 ""Eating raw fish is disgusting"" 
 ""Buddha is the only way"" 
 ""Jesus is the fun way"" 
 ""Communism!"" 
 ""Democracy!"" 
 ""East is red"" 
 ""Better dead than red!"" 
 Peking in the east, New York in the west 
 Each say that they are the best 
 About the sun and the moon and their earthly quest 
 Knew without a doubt that it was all the best 
 They said what does it matter how you read a book 
 It's all the same no matter how it looks 
 Well the only thing important to the Peking king 
 Was feeding in the arms of his New York queen 
 Thousands of miles, they were so far apart 
 How to get together, where to start 
 On the California zipper and the Shanghai express 
 He headed to Hong Kong, she headed out west 
 No passports, no visas, no government quotas 
 No red tape no red guard could stop the dream of the Peking king and the New York Queen 
 I said the Peking king and the New York queen 
 So the found a little lot in the field of dreams 
 It was a perfect little place to live our dream 
 East is east, west is west 
 'Cause you're invited to the wedding to share a dream 
 Of the Peking king and the New York queen 
 Peking king and the New York queen 
 You're invited to the wedding and to share in a dream 
 You're invited to the wedding and to share in a dream 
 Of the Peking king and his New York queen 
 You're invited to the wedding and to share in a dream 
 You're invited to the wedding and to share in a dream 
 Of the sun and the moon 
 Peking king and New York queen"

 Shake dreams from your hair, my pretty child, my sweet one 
 Choose the day, choose the sign of your day, the day's divinity, 
 First thing you see. 
 A vast radiant beach and cool jewelled moon 
 Couples naked race down by its quiet side 
 And we laugh like soft, mad children, 
 Smug in the woolly cotton brains of infancy. 
 The music and voices with all around us. 
 Choose, they croon, the ancient ones, the time has come again. 
 Choose now, they croon, beneath the moon, beside an ancient lake. 
 Enter again the sweet forest. 
 Enter the hot dream, come with us. 
 Everything is broken up and dances. 
 Indian scattered on dawn's highway bleeding. 
 Ghosts crowd the young child's fragile eggshell mind."

 Ghosts crowd the young child's fragile eggshell mind. 
 Blood in the streets in the town of new haven 
 Blood stains the roofs and the palm trees of venice 
 Blood in my love in the terrible summer 
 Bloody red sun of phantastic L.A. 
 Blood screams her brain as they chop off her fingers 
 Blood will be born in the birth if a nation 
 Blood is the rose of mysterious union 
 Blood on the rise, it's following me. 
 Indian, Indian what did you die for? 
 Indian says, nothing at all. 
 Gently they stir, gently rise 
 The dead are newborn awakening 
 With ravaged limbs and wet souls 
 Gently they sigh in rapt funeral amazement 
 Who called these dead to dance? 
 Was it the young woman learning to play the ghost song on her baby grand? 
 Was it the wilderness children? 
 Was it the ghost god himself, stuttering, cheering, chatting blindly? 
 I called you up to anoint the earth 
 I called you to announce sadness falling like burned skin 
 I called you to wish you well 
 To glory in self like a new monster 
 And now I call you to pray"
122,The Doors,rock,To Come Of Age,"A military station in the desert. 
 Can we resolve the past

 The Base 
 To come of age in a dry place 
 Holes and caves. 
 My friend drove and hour each day from the mountains 
 The bus gives you a hard-on with books in your lap 
 Someone shot the bird in the afternoon dance show 
 They gave out free records to the best couple 
 Spades dance best, from the hip."

 And someone knew him 
 Someone knew the TV showman. 
 He came to our homeroom party 
 And played records 
 And when he left in the hot noon sun 
 And walked to his car 
 We saw the chooks had written 
 F-U-C-K on his windshield 
 He wiped it off with a white rag 
 And smiling coolly drove away 
 He's rich, got a big car"

 Scenes of rape in the arroyo.

 Fights at the food stand.

 The shoes, 
 Open shirts and raised collars, 
 Bright sculptured hair. 
 Hey man, you want girls, pills, grass? 
 C'mon... 
 I show you good time. 
 This place has everything. 
 C'mon... 
 I show you."

 No eternal reward will forgive us now 
 For wasting the dawn. 
 Back in those days everything was simpler and more confused 
 One summer night, going to the pier 
 I ran into two young girls 
 The blonde one was called ""Freedom"" 
 The dark one ""Enterprise"" 
 We talked and they told me this story 
 Now listen to this... 
 I'll tell you about Texas radio and the big beat 
 Soft driven, slow and mad 
 Like some new language 
 Reaching your head with the cold, sudden fury of a divine messenger 
 Let me tell you about heartache and the loss of god 
 Wandering, wandering in hopeless night 
 Out here in the perimeter there are no stars 
 Out here we is stoned 
 Immaculate."

 The mindless voice announced 
 All those unseated will await the next show. 
 We filed slowly, languidly into the hall 
 The auditorium was vast and silent 
 As we seated and were darkened, the voice continued. 
 The program for this evening is not new 
 You've seen this entertainment through and through 
 You've seen your birth your life and death 
 You might recall all of the rest 
 Did you have a good world when you died? 
 Enough to base a movie on? . 
 I'm getting out of here 
 Where are you going? 
 To the other side of morning 
 Please don't chase the clouds, pagodas 
 Her cunt gripped him like a warm, friendly hand. 
 It's all right, all your friends are here 
 When can I meet them? 
 After you've eaten 
 I'm not hungry 
 Uh, we meant beaten 
 Silver stream, silvery scream 
 Ooh, impossible concentration."

 We of sun dome and the night 
 Give us a creed to believe a night of lust 
 Give us trust in the night 
 Give of color hundred hues 
 A rich mandala for me and for you 
 And for your silky pillowed house

 Live in the light of certain south 
 Cruel bindings 
 The servants have the power 
 Dog-men and their mean women 
 Pulling poor blankets over our sailors 
 I'm sick of dour faces 
 Staring at me from the TV tower 
 I want roses in my garden bower, dig? 
 Royal babies, rubies 
 Must now replace aborted strangers in the mud 
 These mutants, 
 Blood-meal for the plant that's plowed 
 They are waiting to take us 
 Into the severed garden. 
 Do you know how pale and wanton thrillful 
 Comes death on a stranger hour 
 Unannounced, unplanned for 
 Like a scaring over-friendly guest 
 You've brought to bed 
 Death makes angels of us all 
 And gives us wings 
 Where we had shoulders 
 Smooth as raven's claws 
 No more money, no more fancy dress 
 This other kingdom seems by far the best 
 Until its other jaw reveals incest 
 And loose obedience to a vegetable law 
 I will not go 
 Prefer a feast of friends to the giant family"

 Shake dreams from your hair, my pretty child, my sweet one 
 Choose the day, choose the sign of your day, the day's divinity, 
 First thing you see. 
 A vast radiant beach and cool jewelled moon 
 Couples naked race down by its quiet side 
 And we laugh like soft, mad children, 
 Smug in the woolly cotton brains of infancy. 
 The music and voices with all around us. 
 Choose, they croon, the ancient ones, the time has come again. 
 Choose now, they croon, beneath the moon, beside an ancient lake. 
 Enter again the sweet forest. 
 Enter the hot dream, come with us. 
 Everything is broken up and dances. 
 Indian scattered on dawn's highway bleeding. 
 Ghosts crowd the young child's fragile eggshell mind. 
 We have assembled inside this ancient and insane theatre 
 To propagate our lust for life and flee the swollen wisdom of the streets. 
 The barns are stormed, the windows kept 
 And only one of all the rest 
 Can dance and save us from the divine mockery of words. 
 Music inflames temperament. 
 Oh, great creator of being 
 Grant us one more hour 
 To perform our art and perfect our lives. 
 We need great golden copulations. 
 When the true king's murderers are allowed to roam free 
 A thousand magicians arise in the land. 
 Where are the feasts we were promised?"

 Others, mean and ruthful of the Western dream 
 I love the friends I have gathered together on this thin raft 
 We've constructed pyramids in honor of our escaping 
 This is the land where the Pharaoh died 
 Children, 
 The river contains specimens 
 The voices of singing women 
 Call us on the far shore 
 And they are saying, 
 ""Forget the Night 
 Live with us in Forests of azure"" 
 Meager food for souls forgot

 No eternal reward will

 Wasting the dawn

 And the strange sun 
 And opening your door..."

 Although I still had not found a wife 
 I had my friends 
 Right there beside me 
 We were close together 
 We tripped the wall, we scaled the graveyard 
 Ancient shapes were all around us 
 The wet dew felt fresh beside the fog 
 Two made love in an ancient spot 
 One chased a rabbit into the dark 
 A girl got drunk and balled the dead 
 And I gave empty sermons to my head 
 Cemetery, cool and quiet 
 Hate to leave your sacred lay 
 Dread the milky coming of the day"

205,The Doors,rock,Rapture Riders,"Toe to toe, dancing very close 
 Barely breathing, almost comatose 
 Wall to wall, people hypnotized 
 And they're stepping lightly 
 Hang each night in rapture 
 Back to back, sacroiliac 
 Spineless movement and a wild attack 
 Face to face, sadly solitude 
 And it's finger popping 
 Twenty-four hour shopping in rapture 
 Fab Five Freddie told me everybody's fly 
 DJ's spinnin' are savin' my mind 
 Flash is fast, flash is cool 
 Francois sais pas, flashe' no do 
 And you don't stop, sure shot 
 Go out to the parking lot 
 And you get in your car and drive real far 
 And you drive all night and then you see a light 
 And it comes right down and lands on the ground 
 And out comes a man from Mars 
 And you try to run but he's got a gun 
 And he shoots you dead and he eats your head 
 And then you're in the man from Mars 
 You go out at night eatin' cars 
 You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too 
 Mercurys and Subarus 
 And you don't stop, you keep on eatin' cars 
 Then when there's no more cars 
 You go out at night and eat up bars 
 Where the people meet 
 Face to face, dance cheek to cheek 
 One to one, man to man 
 Dance toe to toe, don't move too slow 
 'Cause the man from Mars is through with cars 
 He's eatin' bars, yeah, wall to wall 
 Door to door, hall to hall 
 He's gonna eat 'em all 
 Rapture, be pure 
 Take a tour through the sewer 
 Don't strain your brain, paint a train 
 You'll be singin' in the rain 
 I said, ""Don't stop, do punk rock"" 
 Man to man, body muscular 
 Seismic decibel by the jugular 
 Wall to wall, tea time technology 
 And a digital ladder, no sign of bad luck in rapture 
 Well, now you see what you wanna be 
 Just have your party on TV 
 'Cause the man from Mars won't eat up bars 
 Where the TV's on 
 Now he's gone back up to space 
 Where he won't have a hassle with the human race 
 And you hip-hop and you don't stop 
 Just blast off, sure shot 
 'Cause the man from Mars 
 Stopped eatin' cars and eatin' bars 
 And now he only eats guitars 
 Get up!"

 There are still a few animals 
 Left out in the yard 
 But it's getting harder to describe sailors

 What got us this far to this mild equator? 
 We need someone or something new 
 Something else to get us through, yeah, c'mon

 Oh, it's gettin' harder 
 Callin' on the dogs

 Too late, baby 
 Slay a few animals 
 At the crossroads 
 Too late 
 All in the yard 
 But it's gettin' harder 
 By the crossroads 
 You gotta meet me 
 Oh, we're goin', we're goin' great at the edge of town 
 Tropic corridor, tropic treasure 
 Havin' a good time got to come along 
 What got us this far to this mild equator? 
 Outskirts of the city 
 You and I we need someone new 
 Somethin' new 
 Somethin' else to get us through
