 He raped... the culture of mankind 
 He raped... the pride of the ancient ways 
 He raped... all thought of freewill 
 I who will watch you fall into obscurity 
 Washing away all filth of righteousness 
 The dimming of the light 
 Engulfing the fucking trinity 
 Dechristianize... Dechristianize... Dechristianize... Dechristianize... 
 Hell's grim tyrant... the eldest of night and chaos 
 Breathe once again... far from the shadow of god

 Praise our fallen ones 
 They walked with the darkness 
 They lived through pain and suffering 
 No regrets... steamroll right through the herde 
 Never looking back 
 Through their veins 
 Flows the blackest of blood... heathens arise 
 Sweep forth the sickle of abomination 
 Continue their murderous fury 
 Ripped from our hands 
 Hear the cries of those left behind 
 Full force 
 Through the storm of retribution 
 Though life was cut short 
 Your memory will carry on 
 Remember the fallen 
 Through celebration of the human kings 
 Look towards the sky 
 That is where I'll never be 
 Walking the path of the wicked 
 Their deeds shall live in infamy 
 (Repeat verses)"
41,Vital Remains,metal,In Infamy,"Hail to the fallen ones 
 Praise our fallen ones 
 They walked with the darkness 
 They lived through pain and suffering 
 No regrets... steamroll right through the herde 
 Never looking back 
 Through their veins 
 Flows the blackest of blood... heathens arise 
 Sweep forth the sickle of abomination 
 Continue their murderous fury 
 Ripped from our hands 
 Hear the cries of those left behind 
 Full force 
 Through the storm of retribution 
 Though life was cut short 
 Your memory will carry on 
 Remember the fallen 
 Through celebration of the human kings 
 Look towards the sky 
 That is where I'll never be 
 Walking the path of the wicked 
 Their deeds shall live in infamy 
 (Repeat verses)"
42,Vital Remains,metal,Disciples Of Hell,"In the darkness, they will gather 
 Conjuring the one 
 Burning candles, incantations 
 Human sacrifice 
 Getting drunk from blood, not wine 
 Pointy daggers shine 
 Out of fire, smoke and brimstone 
 The dreaded one will rise 
 Rise... Burn... Rise... 
 Nobody knows who's the disciples of hell 
 Father's a priest and he's casting a spell 
 No one can stop what's already begun 
 Worshipping darkness and Lucifer's son 
 Victims of the grand illusion 
 Screams of ecstasy 
 Fools are lost in mass confusion 
 Searching for the key 
 Nobody knows who's the disciples of hell 
 Father's a priest and he's casting a spell 
 No one can stop what's already begun 
 Worshipping darkness and Lucifer's son 
 Raise your cup and praise the prince of darkness 
 See the truth of the power within the beast 
 And when the time has come 
 The gates of hell shall open 
 Burning candles, incantations 
 Human sacrifice 
 Out of fire, smoke and brimstone 
 The dreaded one will rise 
 Nobody knows who's the disciples of hell 
 Father's a priest and he's casting a spell 
 No one can stop what's already begun 
 Worshipping darkness and Lucifer's son"
43,Vital Remains,metal,The Trooper,"You'll take my life but I'll take yours too 
 You'll fire your musket but I'll run you through 
 So when you're waiting for the next attack 
 You'd better stand there's no turning back 
 The bugle sounds and the charge begins 
 But on this battlefield no one wins 
 The smell of acrid smoke and horses breath 
 As I plunge on into certain death 
 The horse, he sweats with fear we break to run 
 The mighty roar of the Russian guns 
 And as we race towards the human wall 
 The screams of pain as my comrades fall 
 We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground 
 And the Russians fire another round 
 We get so near yet so far away 
 We won't live to fight another day 
 We get so close near enough to fight 
 When a Russian gets me in his sights 
 He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow 
 A burst of rounds take my horse below 
 And as I lay there gazing at the sky 
 My body's numb and my throat is dry 
 And as I lay forgotten and alone 
 Without a tear I draw my parting groan"
44,Vital Remains,metal,You've Got Another Thing Comin',"One life I'm gonna live it up 
 I'm takin' I said I'll never get enough 
 Stand tall I'm uh, young and kind of proud 
 I'm on the top, but as long as the music's loud 
 If you think I'll sit around as the world goes by 
 You're thinkin' like a fool 'cause it's a case of do or die 
 Out there is a fortune waiting to be had 
 If you think I'll let you go you're mad 
 You've got another thing comin' 
 You've got another thing comin' 
 That's right here's where the talking ends 
 Well, listen, this night there'll be some action spent 
 Drive hard callin' all the shots 
 I got an ace card comin' down rocks 
 If you think I'll sit around while you chip away my brain 
 Listen I ain't foolin' and you'd better think again 
 Out there is a fortune waiting to be had 
 If you think I'll let it go you're mad 
 You've got another thing comin' 
 You've got another thing comin' 
 You've got another thing comin' 
 In this world we're livin' in we have our share of sorrow 
 Answer now and don't give in aim for a new tomorrow 
 Act tough ain't room for second best 
 Real strong got me some security 
 Hey, I'm a big smash I'm goin' for infinity yeah! 
 If you think I'll sit around as the world goes by 
 You're thinkin' like a fool 'cause it's a case of do or die 
 Out there is a fortune waiting to be had 
 If you think I'll let you go you're mad 
 You've got another thing comin' 
 You've got another thing comin' 
 You've got another thing comin' 
 You've got another thing comin' 
 You've got another thing ah 
 Comin' down! 
 If you think I'll sit around while you chip away my brain 
 Listen I ain't foolin' and you'd better think again 
 Out there is a fortune waiting to be had 
 If you think I'll let it go you're mad 
 You've got another thing comin' 
 You've got another thing comin' 
 You've got another thing comin' 
 You've got another thing comin' 
 You've got another thing ah 
 Comin' down! 
 You've got another thing comin' 
 You've got another thing comin' 
 You've got another thing comin' 
 You've got another thing comin' 
 You've got another thing comin' 
 You've got another thing comin' 
 You've got another thing comin' 
 You've got another thing comin' 
 You've got another thing comin'"
