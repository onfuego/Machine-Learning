5,Britney Spears,pop,From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart,"""Never look back,"" we said 
 How was I to know I'd miss you so? 
 Loneliness up ahead, 
 Emptiness behind 
 Where do I go? 
 And you didn't hear 
 All my joy through my tears 
 All my hopes through my fears 
 Did you now? 
 Still I miss you somehow... 
 From the bottom of my broken heart 
 There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know 
 You were my first love, 
 You were my true love 
 From the first kisses to the very last rose 
 From the bottom of my broken heart 
 Even though time may find me somebody new 
 You were my real love 
 I never knew love 
 Till there was you 
 From the bottom of my broken heart 
 ""Baby,"" I said, 
 ""Please stay. Give our love a chance for one more day"" 
 We could have worked things out 
 Taking time is what love's all about 
 But you put a dart 
 Through my dreams 
 Through my heart 
 And I'm back where I started again 
 Never thought it would end 
 You promised yourself 
 But to somebody else 
 And you made it so perfectly clear 
 Still I wish you were here now... 
 ""Never look back,"" we said 
 How was I to know I'd miss you so?"
6,Britney Spears,pop,I Will Be There,"Oh yeah 
 You don't have to say what's on your mind 
 'Cause I know where you've been 
 Give it up and leave it all behind 
 And then let me begin 
 Come on hold my hand 
 Let me show how friends should be 
 I will make it all right... 
 Let me make it clear 
 You can put your trust in me 
 Yes I will be there... 
 When you need someone 
 You just turn around 
 And I will be there 
 When you're feeling low 
 Baby let me know 
 And I will be there 
 Won't you let me make it up to you... 
 Now you know where I am 
 There ain't nothing that I wouldn't do 
 Just to love once again 
 (Bridge and Chorus) 
 Just take a stand 
 I'll be here for you 
 Now and forever 
 Give one more chance 
 Just to show you how much I care 
 Ooh I'll be there 
 When you need someone 
 Just turn around 
 And I will be there 
 When you're in sorrow 
 Just let me know and I will be there 
 I'll be there...

7,Britney Spears,pop,I Will Still Love You,"Time may take us apart, but I will still love you, I promise. 
 And when the stars, stars are falling 
 I'll keep calling 
 I promise that you'll be my one, my only everything 
 I'll never be untrue 
 And I promise that for all your love I will do anything 
 I will give you the stars, I will buy you the moon 
 Even through the longest of our nights 
 And even through the darkest days 
 Our love will find a way 
 And when the stars are falling 
 I'll keep calling 
 I will still love you 
 And when your dreams are fading 
 I'll be waiting 
 I will still love you 
 You are my summer breeze, my winter sun 
 My springtime song, my autumn touch of gold 
 And you are my sky, my rain, the one for which my love grows strong 
 The smile in my heart and the breath in my soul 
 Even if we find ourselves apart 
 We will hold our hopes and dreams 
 Forever in our hearts 
 And when the stars are falling 
 I'll keep calling 
 I will still love you 
 And when your dreams are fading 
 I'll be waiting 
 I will still love you 
 Tell me how you feel 
 I finally know how love feels 
 Tell me if its real 
 And my heart tells me its real 
 So real, So real 
 And when the stars are falling 
 I'll keep calling 
 I will still love you 
 And when your dreams are fading 
 I'll be waiting 
 I will still love you 
 Time may take us apart, that's true 
 But I will always be there for you 
 You're in my heart, you'll be in my dreams 
 No matter how many miles between 
 I promise you that I won't forget 
 The day we kissed or the day we met 
 The sky may fall and the stars may too 
 But I will still, I will still love you 
 And when the stars are falling 
 I'll keep calling 
 I will still love you 
 And when your dreams are fading 
 I'll be waiting 
 I will still love you"

 How can it be this way 
 What have I done, I just can't help but wonder 
 How everything could change 
 'Cause you've turned my world around 
 Since you came along, no 
 After this love was found 
 It seems like we can't go wrong 
 Chorus: Deep in my heart I know there's only you 
 And right from the start I always knew 
 I'll never let go 'cause I love ya so 
 Oh-oh, I want you for the rest of my life

 To find a love like this, oh yeah 
 And here we are with everything we've wished for 
 I've never felt such bliss

 Ah, ah ah 
 They say 
 I'm away 
 Because I'm down with you everyday 
 They say 
 Break away 
 I'm missing out on the fun and games 
 But you smile 
 And the words they tell me 
 Quickly disappear 
 You speak and there is no other 
 Voice that I can hear 
 I spend my days (oh, oh) (all day all night) 
 With you 
 I spend my nights (My nights) 
 Thinkin' about you (2x) 
 You stepped on 
 On my mind 
 And I think about you 
 All the time 
 Day and night 
 Feels so right 
 And for us there is no end in sight 
 Each day that I spend around you 
 Passes by too fast 
 Each night 
 That I spend without you 
 Is longer than the last 
 Oh, 
 You know I can't get enough of you 
 (Can't get enough yeah) (Uh, Uh) 
 You know that twenty-four hours won't ever ever do

 And when you hold me in your arms 
 You make me whole

 Without one kiss from you

 Think of all the times you made me sick 
 I used to think I couldn't handle it 
 What you think, I'm just another chick? 
 Mess with Brit, boy you must have tripped 
 What were you thinkin' when you lost my trust? 
 You had it all and now you're left with nothing 
 Ooh baby, now I know you want my touch 
 And now you're lonely and you still want me 
 I think of all the time that I've wasted 
 Think of all the times that I took you back 
 Ain't no way, I'll be lonely 
 I don't wanna let you back in 
 Let's just face it (Face it) 
 Better off alone and I won't turn back 
 You thought that I would be lonely 
 I don't wanna let you back in 
 Think of all the time that I've wasted 
 Think of all the times that I took you back 
 Ain't no way, I'll be lonely

 That whispers in the dark 
 There's a ray of light somewhere shining through 
 It was sink or swim 
 When the tide came in 
 I found myself 
 When I found you 
 I found the closest thing to heaven 
 Yes I knew, I found the deepest love I knew 
 Ooh-oh-oh, oh I believe yes it's true 
 I found myself 
 When I found you 
 I believe, for every door, that's closing 
 For every heartbreak there's hope for something new 
 From the ashes rised, a glimpse of paradise 
 It's a glimer in your eyes 
 When I found you 
 I found the closest thing to heaven 
 Yes I knew, I found the deepest love I knew 
 Ooh-oh-oh, oh I believe, yes it's true 
 I found myself 
 When I found you 
 A life I thought no one knows 
 I thought love was just the tingling of the skin 
 I felt so alone, all alone 
 More than you could ever know 
 You showed deep love, sweet love 
 When I found you 
 I found the closest thing to heaven 
 I found the deepest love I knew 
 I found the closest thing to heaven 
 I found myself 
 When I found you

 Oh, I went out and I approached him 
 But we couldn't get with his friends 
 He was talking 'bout hittin' up a show 
 So I said ""what the hell, let's go"" 
 Got up and got on the dance floor 
 Hooked up with a guy named Joe 
 When the music was fast and slow 
 What happened next? Guess'

 I found myself flirting with the verge of obscene 
 To the unknown I will be bold 
 I'm going to the places I can be out of control 
 And I don't want to explain tonight 
 All the things I've tried to hide 
 I shut myself out from the world tonight 
 And draw the blinds 
 And I'll teach myself to fly 
 I love myself it's not a sin 
 I can't control what's happening 
 'Cause I just discovered 
 Imagination's taking over 
 Another day without a lover 
 The more I come to understand 
 The touch of my hand 
 The small of my back 
 The arch of my feet 
 Lately I've been noticing the beautiful in me 
 The mole in my skin and I'm not going away 
 I'm in to myself in the most precious way

 You give a little not a lot 
 You coup your love until we kiss 
 You're all I want but not like this 
 I'm watching you disappear 
 But you, you were never here 
 It's only your shadow, never yourself 
 It's only your shadow, nobody else 
 It's only your shadow, filling the room 
 Arriving too late, and leaving too soon 
 And leaving too soon... 
 Your body gives but then holds back 
 The sun is bright, the sky is black 
 Can only be another sign 
 I cannot keep what isn't mine 
 You left and it lingers on 
 But you, you were almost gone 
 It's only your shadow, never yourself 
 It's only your shadow, nobody else 
 It's only your shadow, filling the room 
 Arriving too late, and leaving too soon 
 And leaving too soon... 
 I cannot tell if you mean what you say 
 You say it so loud, but you sound far away 
 Maybe I had just a glimpse of your soul 
 Or was that your shadow I saw on the wall 
 I'm watching you disappear 
 But you, you were never here 
 It's only your shadow, never yourself 
 It's only your shadow, nobody else 
 It's only your shadow, filling the room 
 Arriving too late 
 No, no, no

 It's only your shadow, nobody else 
 It's only your shadow

 I find myself flirting with the verge of obscene 
 Into the unknown, I will be bold 
 I'm going to places I can be out of control 
 And I don't want to explain tonight 
 All the things I've tried to hide 
 I shut myself out from the world so I 
 Can draw the blinds and I'll teach myself to fly 
 I love myself 
 It's not a sin 
 I can't control what's happenin' 
 'Cause I just discovered 
 Imagination's taking over 
 Another day without a lover 
 The more I come to understand 
 The touch of my hand 
 From the small of my back and the arch of my feet 
 Lately I've been noticin' the beautiful me 
 I'm all in my skin and I'm not gonna wait 
 I'm into myself in the most precious way 
 And I don't want to explain tonight

 And my body is mine 
 I won't be left behind

 Take me 
 Touch me 
 Won't you hold me close?

 Coming over me, over me 
 And when we touch 
 This moment when everything's still 
 I close my eyes 
 And then we kiss 
 The feel of your hand 
 As it touches my hair 
 It makes me tremble 
 Don't wanna let go 
 Of the feelings we share 
 So baby, go slow 
 Our hearts beating fast 
 And my body cries 
 I want it to last 
 It's burning inside 
 We're getting deeper 
 You're drifting 
 The sun comes up 
 You're fading 
 You seem so far 
 I don't know 
 If I'm awake 
 Open my eyes 
 And then ww

 And then we kiss 
 And when we touch 
 This moment when everything's still

 I guess I need you baby 
 And every time I see you in my dreams

 I guess I need you baby 
 I make believe 
 That you are here 
 It's the only way

 What have I done

 And this song is my sorry 
 Oh 
 At night I pray 
 That soon your face 
 Will fade away 
 And every time I try to fly 
 I fall without my wings

 What good would it do me now? 
 I'll get it all figured out 
 When I'm out from under 
 So let me go, just let me fly away 
 Let me feel the space between us grow deeper and much darker everyday 
 Watch me now, and I'll be someone new 
 My heart will be unbroken 
 It will open up for everyone but you 
 Even when I cross the line 
 It's like a lie I told a thousand times 
 I don't wanna dream about 
 All the things that never were 
 That maybe I can live without 
 When I'm out from under 
 I don't wanna feel the pain 
 What good would it do me now? 
 I'll get it all figured out 
 When I'm out from under 
 From under, from under 
 From under, from under 
 And part of me still believes when you say you're gonna stick around 
 And part of me still believes we can find a way to work it out 
 But I know that we tried everything we could try 
 So let's just say goodbye forever

 Look like home, take me home 
 And the light in your eyes 
 Lets me know I'm not alone 
 Not alone, not alone, not alone 
 Not alone, not alone, not alone 
 Not alone, not alone, not alone 
 Not alone, not alone, not alone 
 Crossed through the universe to get where you are 
 Traveled the night riding on a shooting star 
 Was lonely then like an alien 
 Had to get used to the world I was on 
 While yet still unsure if I'd knew where I belong 
 Oh that was then, like an alien 
 But the stars in the sky 
 Look like home, take me home 
 And the light in your eyes 
 Lets me know I'm not alone 
 Not alone, not alone, not alone

 Let go, can't hold on when love is broken

 Hide your tears and dry your eyes 
 'Cause I don't wanna see you cry 
 Don't cry, don't cry, cry, cry 
 Don't cry, cry, don't cry, don't cry, cry, cry 
 In the beginning, we were both crazy 
 We were crazy in love 
 But now that it's ending, now I'm just crazy 
 Because we love with no trust 
 Can't go on any longer 
 Baby, we've gotta let it go 
 Move on, can't hold on when love is broken

 Drinking alone in my party dress 
 Would you come back if I looked my best? 
 Put on a smile and I said to myself

 And you will see the rainbow 
 And all the love 
 Everything will be shown 
 So let go 
 Let go 
 The touch of grass 
 The air 
 The sun it will rise 
 You will see so clear 
 It will bring tears to your eyes 
 Maybe everything will be alright 
 So let go

 Don't pretend you didn't know 
 All the bullshit 
 They were turnin' my life into a show 
 Took some time to heal the wounds I had to improvise 
 Pay no mind to all the rumors just a buncha lies 
 Fall back fall back 
 Burnin up all my bridges 
 Fall back fall back 
 Makin' the wrong decision 
 Fall back fall back 
 I'm in a new transition 
 Takin' back the reins again 
 I've changed my ways 
 I can tell you that I feel my feet on the ground again 
 You can see I'm firmly standing feet on the ground again 
 I was lost a while but my feet on the ground again 
 You can't bring me down I got my feet on the ground again 
 Things were gettin' crazy 
 So I had to strategize 
 Look at me I'm changin and its right before your eyes 
 No, it's not fine 
 This is my pride 
 Lost - to my life 
 I've had enough of it 
 Fall fall back 
 Burnin up all my bridges 
 Fall back fall back 
 Makin' the wrong desicion 
 Fall back fall back 
 Lost all of my ambition 
 Fall back fall back 
 I've changed my ways 
 I can tell you that I feel my feet on the ground again 
 You can see I'm firmly standing feet on the ground again 
 I was lost a while but my feet on the ground again 
 You can't bring me down I got my feet on the ground again 
 All of this obsession, isn't it a bit too much? 
 Can't believe that some of you think I have lost my touch 
 Was a phase 
 I just have to 
 Rewind the days 
 Let me out 
 C'mon set me free 
 You were waitin for the new me 
 Its complete 
 Fall back fall back 
 You were my inspiration 
 Fall back fall back 
 This is my dedication 
 I can tell you that I feel my feet on the ground again 
 You can see I'm firmly standing feet on the ground again 
 I was lost a while but my feet on the ground again

 Pero ahora se, que la vida no siempre va en mi camino

 alli es cuando me di cueta que 
 No soy una niña, aún no soy una mujer 
 Todo lo que necesito es tiempo 
 Un momento que es mio 
 Mientras que estoy entremedio 
 No soy una niña 
 No es necesario que me protejan 
 Es hora de que aprenda a enfrentar esto sola 
 He visto mucho mas de lo que tu crees 
 A si es que no me pidas que cierre los ojos 
 No soy una niña, aún no soy una mujer 
 Todo lo que necesito es tiempo 
 Un momento que es mio 
 Mientras que estoy entremedio 
 No soy una niña 
 Pero si me miras con cuidado 
 Verás en mis ojos esa niña 
 que siepre encontrará su camino 
 No soy una niña, aún no soy una mujer

 Stop, you're making me blush

 I'm checking so hot, so hot 
 Wonder if he knows, he's on my radar 
 On my radar, on my radar, on my radar

 Choosing, don't wanna losing you 
 On my radar, on my radar

 Interesting sense of style 
 Ten million dollar smile 
 Think I can handle that 
 Animal in the sack 
 His eyes see right to my soul 
 I surrender self-control 
 Catch me looking again 
 Falling right into my plan

 But I'm just Britney Spears and I got all this power 
 But the bottom line is I don't even use it 
 Right when you become a bitch that's when you lose it 
 So what if I do? What if I lose it all today? 
 I've always got my friends to hold me all the way 
 Happiness is the key, and love when you fall

 Please - just get to the point when you talk to me 
 And if a favor gets involved, just rub my feet 
 Yeah this business is fucked 
 And I want some fun 
 I wanna sit at home and watch Dumb and Dumber 
 Sike- I take that back, I'm just trickin' you see 
 'Cause when I show my belly everybody copies me 
 It's kinda cool, nothin' but guys 
 But I'm just Britney Spears and I got all this power 
 But the bottom line is I don't even use it 
 Right when you become a bitch that's when you lose it 
 So what if I do? What if I lose it all today? 
 I've always got my friends to hold me all the way 
 Happiness is the key, and love when you fall 
 Like Lauren Hill said you ain't got that - got nothing at all, y'all 
 So how you been? 
 It's been awhile.

 It really feels nice

 All the time Oh counting sheep 
 Thought I knew better but I'm lost 
 And now I'll talk about the cross 
 I cried till mornin' when you died 
 I thought wot I got to hide 
 I needed some love, oh some comfort

 Give us thankful hearts that we may seek 
 All the gifts we share and every blessing 
 All things come of thee.

 Bringing forth fruit and flower 
 Look at the sky

 Look at the trees 
 Look at the hills and mountains 
 Valleys and flowing rivers 
 Field and plain.

 Think the warmth of summer

 Before the winters cold 
 Everythinbg grows 
 Everything has it's season 
 Till it is gathered in the farmers fold

 Everytime you walk on by 
 I try to say something, but end up with nothing 
 Everytime you walk on by 
 Everytime you walk on by... 
 I keep my cool and pretend I'm not here 
 Everytime you come too near 
 I'm such a fool 'cause 
 This love is true and 
 If I don't tell you, someone else surely will 
 Everywhere I turn, I see your face 
 Reminding me of a higher place 
 Everytime you smile, angels cry 
 Everytime you walk on by 
 I'm not the only feeling lonely 
 Everytime you walk on by 
 I try to say something, but end up with nothing 
 Everytime you walk on by, yeah 
 If I ever see you again 
 This craziness must find an end 
 I look at you, I promise myself... 
 2X: 
 I'm not the only feeling lonely 
 Everytime you walk on by 
 I try to say something, but end up with nothing 
 Everytime you walk on by

314,Britney Spears,pop,Weakness,"'I am like, like a river in the sky, 
 I don't know why 
 And the tears they have begun to fall again 
 Fall down on my face 
 I hold my own hands 
 So you won't see a trace of my weakness. 
 I will be a star in the sky 
 So you can see 
 How bright I really shine 
 When I'm awake 
 And these clouds are around 
 I want to make, I wanna make you so proud 
 Do you love me, the way you used to? 
 Do you want me? 
 Do you long for my body? 
 Do you feel them, feel those butterflies? 
 Oh baby if you don't, please take all of mine.'"
315,Britney Spears,pop,What Love Is (Interlude),"sung: 
 I guess this is what love is 
 A very strange and mysterious thing 
 All these mixed up feelings 
 Can toy with someone's head 
 If you're not careful 
 Things can get out of control 
 And soon 
 You might not be in love anymore 
 Take it slow 
 Take it slow 
 Love can mean many different things 
 There are upsides 
 There are downsides 
 spoken: 
 Look up, you have someone new to love 
 And spend time with when you really need someone 
 Look down, you have almost no free time 
 No time to just be you and you alone 
 sung: 
 I guess this is what love is 
 This is what love is 
 Some can live without love 
 Some can't live without 
 Some people, they just don't know 
 What love is all about 
 Love is a many splendored thing 
 It can put you right where you belong 
 I guess this is what love is 
 I guess this is what love is 
 What 
 Love 
 Is... 
 I know that this is 
 I know that this is 
 I know that this is... 
 That this is what love is"

 AC: 
 (Ay oh) let me do my thing with a New York verse 
 AC will make you hot, girl, remove your shirt 
 I got my eyes closed, you could do your dirt 
 And by the way, do you still got that schoolgirl skirt? 
 Like the cops, Imma watch her watch me 
 Shot with a chaser like the paparazzi 
 It's crazy, she still on top o' the biz 
 I'm with Brit, while K-Fed watchin' the kids 
 Britney (verse 1): 
 He was kinda like a summer fling 
 Hot and heavy through that April rain 
 May and June he was after me 
 By July, it was getting hypnotic 
 So he kinda started feelin' my fame 
 I don't really wanna say his name 
 All I know is I liked his drank 
 All my girls, say mmm if you feel me 
 I saw you there, I can't get you out my sight, boy 
 Better go and get another drank, 'cause you ain't getting none of mine, no 
 Oh, tell me whatcha sippin' on 
 Baby, baby, baby 
 Oh, tell me whatcha sippin' on 
 Baby, baby, baby 
 Britney (verse 2): 
 What I feel is more than a crush 
 Then again, it's not quite love 
 Just enough to fill my cup 
 Whatever you do, just keep it flowin' 
 So tell me how you like it babe 
 On the rocks, or straight up babe 
 Oh boy don't be afraid, I'm right here and I'm gonna show ya 
 I saw you there, I can't get you outta my mind, boy 
 Better go and get another drink 
 All my girls say 
 Oh, oh, tell me whatcha sippin' on 
 Baby, baby, baby 
 Oh, tell me whatcha sippin' on 
 Baby, baby, baby

 The way you look at me, I just can't say no 
 So we should hook up, who knows where we will go 
 Cause baby when I'm with you, I feel I'm losing control 
 Oh boy, you hit the spot 
 See baby, please don't stop 
 Do you like my lemon drop (just taste it baby) 
 You make me feel so hot 
 Summertime love is all we got 
 Here we are, lets take a shot 
 (This is AC baby) 
 AC: 
 All the tabloids tell me how you was a handful 
 Toxic, try to make you an example 
 You know me, I'm just tryin' to have you shoot for the airport (?) 
 'Cause all this stress got me losing my hair too 
 Lets release, get live on the track 
 Got my baby in the whip, she could ride on my lap 
 Put that one finger up, mommy, guzzle some more 
 Tell them the only issues you got is the covers you on, uh 
 One more drink, make us some o' the bomb 
 Order shot, bartender gave one in the arm 
 All you rappers better recognize the best 
 'Cause AC 'bout to blow like a breathalyzer test (yes) 
 Oh, oh, tell me whatcha sippin' on 
 Oh, tell me whatcha sippin' on 
 Baby, baby, baby

320,Britney Spears,pop,When It Comes To You,"I have given all my life to you, 
 Still I can't see you through. 
 I've been waiting for a star to fall 
 And I've come to the point where I can't stand one more single lie, 
 No more lies. 
 You gave me gold and I called you teaser 
 But you told all your friends: 'It was just to please her'. 
 How come every road I walk is winding, 
 When I can watch from behind as you are sliding? 
 I believe in life, 
 I believe in dreams, 
 I believe in everything in between, 
 But I know for sure my love is more than you can retrieve. 
 I gave it all, I got it back, right in the face it's just the fact 
 That my pure love has turned to hate when it comes to you... 
 He turns page in his magazine 
 And I watch him putting on that grin, 
 Then I say it all out loud. 
 That I've come to the point where I can't stand one more single lie, 
 No more lies. 
 As the color of his face starts turning 
 I take my chance to say what I'd like him to learn 
 And what gets me the most is that he's always sliding, 
 When every road I walk seems to be winding? 
 I believe in life, 
 I believe in dreams, 
 I believe in everything in between, 
 But I know for sure my love is more than you can retrieve. 
 I gave it all, I got it back, right in the face it's just the fact 
 That my pure love has turned to hate when it comes to you... 
 I have given all my life to you 
 Still I can't see you through. 
 I've been waiting to for a star to fall. 
 And I've come to the point where I can't stand one more single lie, 
 No more lies. 
 I believe in life, 
 I believe in dreams, 
 I believe in everything in between, 
 But I know for sure my love is more than you can retrieve. 
 I gave it all, I got it back, right in the face it's just the fact 
 That my pure love has turned to hate when it comes to you..."

 You are weak in me 
 I can feel it 
 But do you think I care 
 If you cry 
 I will laugh at you 
 I'm sick of stroking your hair 
 Could you take it 
 Can you make it 
 Don't wanna fake it 
 So don't you say that 
 Love is a fight 
 You don't know what it's like to die 
 You will never feel it coming, feel it coming 
 If you choose to walk away from love 
 You'll be gone and I'll be coming 
 I am free, I am me 
 I am breathing 
 The air that's rightfully mine 
 Drew the line 
 You had to go this time 
 Drove the message into your spine 
 Couldn't take it 
 Couldn't make it 
 I didn't fake it 
 Now you can say that 
 Love is a fight 
 'Cause you know what it's like, you died"
