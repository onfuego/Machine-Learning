0,Killer Mike,hiphop,Monster (Intro),"Peace will never tame the hatred in me 
 I'm too restricted 
 Seperated from your society 
 I'm a new breed of species 
 A curse to lips that speak my name 
 I'm different, twisted 
 My mind is not the same 
 For those who deny the truth 
 But seek to try to find it 
 You my friend are blind to the truth 
 For you are simple minded 
 My ways are called abnormal 
 They treat me as if forsaken 
 But all shall fear the Wrath 
 Just like when my heart was taken 
 And if these words fail to reach the ears of the limited few 
 You won't know but when I strike you'll wish that you would have knew 
 This beast is on the loose if you treasure life then destroy it 
 For it is too realistic to simply ignore it 
 I've given a fair warning now beware because I'm cutting loose 
 And new terror walks the Earth 
 And now it's all up to you 
 If all hope should fair and you should sit an ponder 
 You fate has been decided by one dangerous monster"
1,Killer Mike,hiphop,Monster,"Peace will never tame the hatrid of me 
 I'm too restricted, separated from your society... 
 I'm a new breed of species, a curse to lift that speak my name 
 I'm different twisted, my mind is not the same 
 For those who deny the truth, will seek to try and find it 
 You my friend are blinds of the truth for you are simple minded

2,Killer Mike,hiphop,Akshon (Yeah!),"Let's do that shit 
 Yeah! Killer keeps it honest 
 Cause reality is perception with a weak stomach 
 Bubbling uneasy like the bowels of hell (Boo!) 
 Enough to make a black ghost turn pale 
 Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! 
 (Verse One) 
 K-I-L-L 
 This is the name that came to alter the game 
 Not like these rappers who spit it the same 
 Separate lames from they chain 
 My mind don't slack 
 I'm totally focused on beating up tracks 
 Monsterous music to beat in your 'Lac 
 1000 watt amp with woofers in back 
 Lean to da left if you burning a sac 
 Baby got back and its in Baby Phat 
 Pardon me dog 4 chasing the cat 
 I'm hittin all kittens meowing like that 
 I like the front but I'm loving the back 
 I like to bite and I'm hoping she scratch 
 Escalade dipping I'm holding the lane 
 Mama's a scholar she blowing my brain 
 Ain't this the life? 
 Snapping and Trappin and Rappin' and Frappin all night 
 Lil mama's a plumber she handling pipe 
 Ill wit a pill she handle it right 
 Like Iverson, the smallest thing on the team 
 But the livest one 
 Cocked loaded bust like a gun 
 Y'all better run, one, one! 
 (Hook by big boi) 
 Thump, thump, thump, thump (yeah) 
 All in your trunk (yeah) 
 Grinding and hustling and getting at mine 
 Swerving and token and grippin on pine 
 Bump, bump, bump, bump 
 All in your trunk 
 Woofers and tweeters and speakers and geekers 
 Crawl in your bunk 
 (Verse Two) 
 How we gon' stop (whoa) 
 How we gone quit (shitttt!) 
 Brand new shoes and socks on the Chevy 
 I came through swerving like this (I'm 
 Good wit the game, gutter fo' show 
 Ducking you lames and obstacles 
 Go get that ass in a hospital 
 Wrapped in a cast from head to toe 
 This boy he real! 
 Racing those candy Sevilles through Dixie Hills 
 My car do wheelies they drive on three wheels 
 First round pick like Michael Vick 
 Quarterback status throw passes at chicks 
 Santana Moss When catching the ball 
 Get it? Like Moss she catches the ball 
 Perfectly tuned my engine don't stall 
 And I'm equipped with nitros y'all 
 Ready to rip, burn, roar! 
 Ready to tear through your city and tour 
 Took The Whole World and murdered that shit! 
 Caught the beat running and dipped with that bitch! 
 Later for now I'm hustling hits 
 Flipping my words like bricks, trick! 
 (Ending) 
 New, new! That new new! 
 New new for you you! 
 New new for you you! 
 That new new! That new new! 
 New new for you you! 
 New new for you you!"
3,Killer Mike,hiphop,Rap Is Dead,"Big is dead, Pac is dead 
 My music's dead, and y'all just scared 
 {Scratched: ""I'm Killer Mike, I'm Killer Mike, I'm Killer Mike, I'm Killer Mike""} 
 Rap is dead, rock is dead 
 My music's dead, and y'all just scared 
 (Verse 1: Killer Mike) 
 Fuck rap, rap's near death, bloated and sick 
 Too many niggaz still ride, Big and Pac's dick 
 Fuck that, next year, they more deader 
 And I write more rhymes, more deadly and more better 
 Then the last, sick and disturbed verse I wrote 
 And sell it to tough teenage boys to quote 
 Some music to madness, let the anger kill the pain and the sadness 
 Fuck the fag shit, keep it Killer with the rap shit 
 Hard rock when you rock shit, back to the block freestyle pop lock shit 
 Back to the basics with the fuck a cop shit 
 Rock pussies rap on some pop shit, sing like they rap 
 Soft and frail, these spirits, didn't have the heart to smell 
 This is no pain, and it's high octane 
 A bad brain, on Kobain 
 Lennon is dead, Kurt is dead 
 My music's dead, and y'all just scared 
 {Scratched: ""Killer Mike, who's the man, Killer Mike, who's the man""} 
 Rap is dead, rock is dead 
 My music's dead, and y'all just scared 
 {Scratched: ""Killer Mike, who's the man, Killer Mike, who's the man""} 
 (Verse 2: Killer Mike) 
 God damnit rappers chitter chattar, on any subject matter 
 But really does the subject really matter 
 Pass the guns and blood splatter, does anything fuckin' matter 
 Pass Cristal, pissed off, fuckin' right I'm pissed off 
 And you a pistol, yo why the fuck do critics (?) 
 Now wait a second, don't like what I'm saying 
 Make a record, and I'll be glad when 
 My music gets mad again, new school Ice Cube 
 ""Fuck you Killer Mike!"" Yeah fuck you too 
 No this ain't yo mama's music 
 It's a drug if you like it, please abuse it 
 Here's a cool meth-amphetamine for teens 
 Nightmares comin', crushing ya fuckin' dreams, ultra-shock 
 Rap rock, bringin' the bars back to rock and hip-hop 
 Spit it, venom non-stop 
 Big is dead, Pac is dead 
 My music's dead, and y'all just scared 
 {Scratched: ""Hip-Hop is, Killer Mike, Hip-Hop is, Killer Mike""} 
 Rap is dead, rock is dead 
 My music's dead, and y'all just scared 
 {Scratched: ""Hip-Hop is, Killer Mike, Hip-Hop is, Killer Mike""} 
 (Verse 3: Killer Mike) 
 Knew it was a bad day when I woke up 
 N-W-A's gonna raise (?) broke up 
 Damn prayers ain't move the units that they should've 
 Rappers on top don't spit like they could've 
 I pledge allegiance to the hard, core 
 How I give it to you, hard, raw 
 Ay, a beautiful site to be seen 
 There's a mosh pit packed with wild teens 
 Hangin' onto every word that we spit 
 Ready to rip, rock, and tear shit 
 Self-pity's fuckin' up my music man 
 Whine like a bitch or stand and be a man 
 There's +Black Sabbath+, I'm smoking in a +Zeppelin+ 
 Pumpin' +Metallica+, hand on my weapon 
 Fuck you and the bed yo bitch slept in 
 Killer-Kill keeps it real, hardcore is what I'm reppin' 
 Big is dead, Pac is dead 
 My music's dead, and y'all just scared 
 {Scratched: ""I run shit, Killer Mike, I run shit, Killer Mike""} 
 Lennon is dead, Kurt is dead 
 My music's dead, and y'all just scared 
 {Scratched: ""I run shit, Killer Mike, I run shit, Killer Mike""} 
 Rap is dead, Killer Mike"
4,Killer Mike,hiphop,Scared Straight,"(Killer Mike talking on the phone) 
 Aight... so you niggaz wanna know how a nigga is up in jail... 
 Servin' a 40 to life sentence... 
 For dope that wasn't even his 
 Just sit back and listen, I'll tell you 
 It's a hilarious day boooy, and it's a wild, wild chain of events 
 That get yo ass in hea... 
 (Chorus) (Killer Mike talking) 
 Mama, I don't wanna sell, birds no more 
 (I got a fuckin' funny story to tell you) 
 They pushed me down and locked me up 
 Put my face on the floor 
 (You rem'ber me and big Paul and my whole crew nigga?) 
 They took my money and my credit card 
 Now I'm poor 
 (Government snitches are amazin...) 
 Mama, I don't wanna sell, crack no more 
 (Just listen, only take about 3 minutes, just listen) 
 After high school, I gained lots of weight 
 And I ain't talkin' bout calories put on by steak 
 The recipe I'm cookin' may send me upstate 
 Use bakin' soda, cook the pie, collect cake 
 Now Pillsbury, these niggaz kick down doors 
 Find out what mills bury 
 Shit's very intense and criti-cal 
 And when we drew pistols shit got piti-ful 
 The first lick was bullshit, a half a brick 
 We robbed the middle man and a bum bitch, the dumb bitch 
 But between me and him and that hoe 
 We walked away with 18 and a bigger score 
 Some nigga named Salvatore from El Salvador 
 Got silver teeth and a scar on his jaw 
 Young Antonio Montana, held up mansion north Atlanta 
 We hit'em hard as doors hammer, yeah! 
 (Chorus) (Killer Mike talking) 
 Mama, I don't wanna sell, birds no more 
 (Okay, I know whachu thinkin', it's on righ, we on righ, we on) 
 They pushed me down and locked me up 
 Put my face on the floor 
 (Hold up, hold up, hold up, be patient, be patient, listen to the rest 
 Listen, listen) 
 They took my money and my credit card 
 Now I'm poor 
 (Man I feel like a asshole just tellin' you this man) 
 Mama, I don't wanna sell, crack no more 
 (Tell the kid to give me the card, check it out 
 Here's where it gets interestin, follow this shit) 
 ??? The spot had more birds than a pet shop 
 More gunz than a Vietnam vet, we was set 
 Loaded up the work and let's jet 
 My nigga big Paul loaded up the U-Haul 
 A thousand pounds uncut raw 
 Hold on, whus that I saw in the distance? 
 Did he have a crew offerin assistance? 
 Paul said it's prolly nothin', a small animal or somethin' 
 My nerves got to jumpin', I swear I heard somethin' 
 I pointed the 4-5th in the wind and started thumpin' 
 The blue lights is comin', my crew is runnin' 
 Cops is everywhere, they keep comin' 
 All of us sick, and all of us caught, holdin' our dick 
 We robbed the niggaz, same day the fuckin' FEDs hit 
 We robbed the niggaz, same day the fuckin' FEDs hit 
 Me and Salvatore fucked up in the mix 
 That middle man and dumb bitch 
 Them niggaz snitched, GOD DAMN! 
 (Chorus) (Killer Mike talking) 
 Mama, I don't wanna sell, birds no more 
 (So young man, that's why the fuck I'm sittin' here wearin these pants ???) 
 They pushed me down and locked me up 
 Put my face on the floor 
 (I hear Salvatore got ??? or some shit) 
 They took my money and my credit card 
 Now I'm poor 
 (The bum bitch that snitched, tss... who knows?) 
 Mama I don't wanna sell, crack no more 
 (Man I shoulda fuckin' stayed in job corp 
 Stayed my fuckin' ass in job corp, doin' dumbass shit 
 Now I'm fuckin' round witchall stupid ass niggaz too 
 Ain't no niggaz in jail but dumb niggaz 
 Niggaz ??? 
 Fuck that, I was stupid, I'm in jail 
 And most the niggaz in hea with me stupid too... 
 (Laughs and hangs up the phone))"
5,Killer Mike,hiphop,All 4 U,"Give you what you want when you want it 
 (Cool and Dre, Killer Mike) 
 Give you what you need when you need it 
 (I think we got a poor people's anthem) 
 Baby we're all gonna make it 
 (It's what the streets need and want right now) 
 (I'm tellin' you, it's it, some substance baby) 
 Give you what you want when you want it 
 (I'm givin' it) 
 Give you what you need when you need it 
 (It's all for you, it's all for you) 
 Baby we're all gonna make it 
 We came up the hard way 
 The steal or starve way 
 Ski masks and get robbed way 
 Far from Broadway 
 Tragic but it's no play 
 And we livin' on the prayers our grandmother pray 
 Still remember Big Spank got slayed 
 Right on Allen Temple 
 My God poor people you're my heart and it that simple 
 And I'ma rap through the hurt until I meet dirt 
 And I'ma make 'em recognize your worth 
 Through the words of my work 
 To the children reared in the gutters 
 By single mothers 
 This might kill your big brother 
 Sayin' we ain't got much but we got each other 
 We got each other 
 Our roads rough, gettin' rougher 
 When times got tough we got tougher 
 We'll make it, just stay down for one another 
 Allow me to spill my heart and say I love you 
 Allow me to spill my heart and just say I love you 
 C'mon 
 (Ay girl I know it's hard) 
 Give you what you want when you want it 
 (Walkin' through the hood, one job (?), two children, groceries) 
 Give you what you need when you need it 
 (You goin' to work everyday tryin' to keep that car (?), tryin' to keep that apartment) 
 Baby we're all gonna make it 
 (I'm just here to let you know that I'm witchu sweetheart) 
 Give you what you want when you want it 
 (I'm witchu everyday Mom) 
 Give you what you need when you need it 
 (Just feel me) 
 Baby we're all gonna make it 
 (Somebody understands and feels you, you feel me?) 
 Sisters, I know it seems we're total fuck ups 
 But hold your head up 
 We're slippin', we fallin', but we gon' get up 
 And we gon' get this life together 
 I'll make you a wife and make it better 
 More than a song, an open love letter 
 To all the mothers 
 Who lost sons to a gun or life sentence 
 Wish I could give more than words in a sentence 
 This is your story 
 We are your sons 
 This is my plea for forgiveness 
 For our wrongs 
 For all the hurt we caused and prolonged 
 Times we was weak you stayed strong 
 And we repaid that by hustlin' crack 
 Out the back of your apartment 
 The narcs hit, put your face in the carpet 
 You accepted the risk, never turned snitch 
 And I still use the word ""bitch"" 
 Yo, I'm a dumbass, a dipshit 
 And through it all you claimed and acknowledged me 
 I hope this song can serve as my apology 
 Give you what you want when you want it 
 (I'm tellin' you I'm sorry) 
 Give you what you need when you need it 
 (This next one's for Niecy) 
 Baby we're all gonna make it 
 (This for you Ma, this for you) 
 (Look at you boy, top of the world) 
 Give you what you want when you want it 
 (Top of the world Mama) 
 Give you what you need when you need it 
 (And we ain't never goin' back down) 
 Baby we're all gonna make it 
 All I wanted was a hot pair of Air Force Ones 
 Sick of being picked on 'cause we was from the slums 
 Sick of seein' my old man shit on my mom 
 Sick of feelin' even worse when a new nigga come 
 Just wanted to make it better 
 Just wanted to make cheddar 
 Just wanted to make it so you could walk with you head up 
 Rap was hope 
 And I held it like a vendetta 
 Or even better, like a Beretta 
 Kept the rhyme pad tucked under coat and sweater 
 I kept 'em like prison letters 
 Stack neatly in a shoebox 
 On top, stolen Glock and fifty rocks 
 Despite the hustle 
 Rhymes was the means to a end 
 I was born to marry thought with a paper and pen 
 Wasn't born to be on paper or locked in a pen 
 I was born to bring honor to this brown skin 
 Mama I'm your son and you're my best friend 
 Wipe your tears away, just hide it with a graceful grin 
 (Give you what you want when you want it) 
 I made good and you'll never have to hurt again 
 (Give you what you need when you need it) 
 I made good and you'll never have to hurt again 
 (Niecy's boy done good) 
 Baby we're all gonna make it 
 (Niecy's boy has done good) 
 Give you what you want when you want it 
 (I'll make you proud) 
 Give you what you need when you need it 
 (Your name will be spoken with honor baby, believe it) 
 Baby we're all gonna make it 
 (Niecy's boy done good) 
 Give you what you want when you want it 
 (You see it) 
 Give you what you need when you need it 
 (Respect and acknowledge it) 
 Baby we're all gonna make it 
 (I love you baby) 
 (It's for my people) 
 Give you what you want when you want it 
 (Bring honor to this skin baby, rise out of it) 
 Give you what you need when you need it 
 (Come out of the gutter) 
 Baby we're all gonna make it 
 (We are the diamonds in the rough) 
 It's all love 
 My man Mark, my man Rico 
 Glide (?), my man Tae, my man Zack, 
 Slum Lordz till death 
 I love you 
 (It's all for you) 
 Niggas better know 
 (I love you, I love you, I love you) 
 Don't be hard, open your heart 
 Feel it, feel it 
 My man Terrence, my man Casko (?) behind bars 
 (It's all for you, it's all for you, it's all for you)"
6,Killer Mike,hiphop,A.D.I.D.A.S.,"Pussy nigga whatcha doin'! 
 All day I dream about, all day I dream about 
 Sex 
 It's the way you move your sexy groove 
 That's got my mind all over you 
 All day I dream about, all day I dream about 
 Your sex feels so savoifare 
 I'm tired of jercking off cause your not there 
 Big Boi 
 65' Chevrolet Impala peachy cream 
 Oozing down the street like toothpaste 
 Cause the ivory is clean 
 Talkin' bout mean at the inseam on the inside of the ship 
 Not a honey dip to hunch on, testes more blue than a Crip 
 Or the blue man group caught that on the Vegas strip 
 Chillin' with good game, Ju Ju, Pimpin' Ken and my nigga Don Magic 
 Pimpin' Ken and my nigga Diamond Jit 
 Pimps (pimps), lips (lips), legs (legs), arms (arms), 
 Necks (necks), hips (hips), head (head) monk test 
 It's the camel toe and that's fo' sho' 
 My brain is on one track 
 Like Marion Berry thoughts for crack 
 Or like a rock star does for smack. 
 None of that but the female genitalia's where it's at 
 I'm a man and I demand a woman for that act 
 Personal preference plus I use the law of nature as a reference 
 Now I don't ever recall seeing a man turn up pregnant, but that's just me 
 Feminine female fantasies frolic freely in my cockpit 
 Every thirty something seconds I can't stop it 
 Killer Mike 
 Killer Kill from Adamsville and in my Bonneville I chill 
 Heifers call me Black and Decker, I don't screw them hoes I drill 
 I've been cuttin' cute lil' coochies since before the record deal 
 Catch me daydreaming about them, thick, medium or slim 
 Doctors call that thing vagina, in the hood we call it trim 
 White boys call it snatch, Puerto Ricans call it chocha 
 Nathaniel likes his white, I like mines dark as cola 
 It's the first thing on my mind in the morn when I roll over 
 All men young and old in the end it's what we're after 
 Even my grandpappy's happy. He got prescribed Viagra. 
 (Granddaddy, granddaddy, what's up? what's up? It's me. 
 Hey, let me get about three of them blue diamonds. 
 I promise I gotcha back tomorrow) 
 Killer Mike 
 When I drill I don't spill even if she's on the pill 
 Keep my weapon covered concealed and in a shield 
 'Cause I don't need that A.I.D.S. 
 A ""D"" and a ""A"" missing out my A.D.I.D.A.S. (plus) 
 We don't need no DNA mixing between us 
 We just need to keep this thing friendly and hush, hush 
 On the down low, like R. Kelly and youngsters 
 But over eighteen only cause baby I'm no perv! 
 From the tour bus to the lobby, elevator to the room 
 We can jump each other's bones but there's no jumping brooms! 
 Big Boi 
 Buffoon you are to consumed in the womb 
 It is too early for you to jump the broom (boom!) 
 ""Monster"" 
 Verse One 
 I'm an ungodly figure 
 When in the company of hard liquor 
 Texas niggaz turned me on to water 
 I smoked the river 
 Apocalyptic creature, stay lacing reefer 
 Stay serving geekers, stay holding heaters 
 Murder fanatic, killer fantastic 
 Swerving semi-conscious with a half a blunt and an automatic 
 Bought it to snort it, just in case I meet with static 
 What I deliver to your address is dead tragic 
 Your mother scream in that limousine 
 Followed by some slow traffic 
 Here's the reason for my murder tactics 
 I'm Killer Kill I ain't a fuckin' rapper! I'm a crack sacker! 
 I'm a strong-armed robbery and kidnapper! 
 I'm a carjacker! I'm a if you owe dough then yo' ho snatcher! 
 I'm a Slumlord for life not a fuckin' actor! 
 I'm the fear that haunts you! I'm the tool that's used to haunt you! 
 I'm the monster! I'm your sick and twisted monster! 
 (Repeat) 
 Verse Two 
 I'm the hate in the dark heart of heartless men! 
 Deprived of love, feed crack, nurtured in sin! 
 I'm unwanted children doped up on Ritalin by age ten 
 At sixteen a fiend! Nurturing a weed habit and a bottle of gin 
 I'm the soul of women that's been betrayed by men 
 That trifling nigga looking to deceive her again 
 Earn her trust again, then I lust again 
 When she turn her back, I'm diggin in her friend again! 
 I motivate your hate and embody your sin 
 I spit it for Bloods, Crips and Mexicans 
 I spit for Disciples and El Rukns 
 This sick soundtrack to robbing and looting 
 Neighbor shootings, murder and boosting 
 Its fear engaged, with a fury and rage 
 For my lost generation in these last days 
 The fear that haunts you! It's the tool that's used to hunt you!"
7,Killer Mike,hiphop,Creep Show,"Welcome to the creep show, street show, freak show, peep show 
 Anything goes strippers and live shows 
 It's the creep show, street show, freak show, peep show 
 Exctasy, hydro, and good blow 
 It's the creep show, street show, freak show, peep show 
 Hoes strip, where pimps and hoes do strolls 
 It's the creep show, street show, freak show, peep show 
 Where hustlas collect rocks and straight rolls 
 (Verse 1: Killer MIke) 
 Welcome home motherfuckers your back again 
 Into the den of inequity the life of sin 
 Where after the after party and the hotel lobbies 
 Probably find me drunk off Bacardi in a swank hotel 
 An aspiring actress 
 Trying to push her back through a thousand dollar mattress 
 In Chicago a couple of bottles, couple of models, stolen Diablos 
 Fast and furious going full throttle 
 Post club function, pills get swallowed 
 Ladies get loose and so do bra staps 
 Power, money, and sex drive good raps 
 Freaks emerge in a twilight with party pack 
 Of hydros alcohol blurred eye sight 
 From dusk till dawn is when vampires roam 
 Pro athletes trick and don't go home 
 (Verse 2: Killer Mike) 
 Riding with my nigga Big Boi you don't sleep 
 Even partied with Diddy up in NYC 
 Got drunk, rubbed titties of Dominican freaks 
 Every night bachelor party in the boom boom room 
 On trees get burned or liquor consumed 
 You ain't really seen a color till you seen it on shrooms 
 Lipstick on the pale of my Pelle Pele 
 Spot hotter than fish scales cooked in coked ale 
 Vampire party and we gets it down 
 In the undergrounds underground 
 Underground in club commer's basement 
 Ladies and low lifes do get wasted 
 So high you can't hear the music but you feel it when the bass hits 
 The atmosphere like the first year 
 Freak bass hit everybodys heart goes fast 
 Rolling Mitsubishi's shakin' that ass 
 (Verse 3: Bizarre) 
 Got twenties on the Escort, bitch park my shit 
 It's Bizarre from D12 in this bitch (yeah) 
 And wich nigga want to fight (what!) 
 I'm the club with Suge Knight, Ike, and Killer Mike (how does it feel) 
 Fat dick for all my enemies 
 Caught a disease fucking Roy and Jazzie T (a ha ha) 
 My girlfriends a fucking fool 
 When she turned her back 
 I'm making out with her mother like I'm in high school (shhh) 
 And I don't sale crack to my African brothers 
 I sell it to they mothers and they ex-lovers (that's true) 
 So go ahead bitch pop the X 
 So I can work your neck in the back of my Vett (ah!) 
 Red bones, I hate 'em no question 
 I like fat bitches with bladder infections (ughh) 
 Bizarre get down from strokers to Magic City 
 It's the creep show, show your nasty titties"
8,Killer Mike,hiphop,U Know I Love You,"Whoa, baby, whoa, baby, whoa, baby 
 La la la, la la la, yeah... 
 I would never leave you girl (My girl, my wife) 
 You know I love you (My pain, my strife) 
 Oh baby, oh baby 
 I would never leave you girl (Good days, bad nights) 
 You know I love you (Lovely fistfights) 
 Oh baby, oh baby 
 (Killer Mike) 
 Killa for, look at us, forvever fucked up 
 All we do is fuck, fight, and get X'ed up 
 Enough, enough 
 We bad for each other, mama 
 But our sex life ain't right without drama 
 In combat, sweet agony upon that 
 I deliver, make you take it soft and break it hard 
 Like dope dealers, I'm a husband to a wife 
 But I'm ya nigga, and you a perfect drug 
 Make a nigga heart quiver 
 You a hard breakin hard liquor on my liver 
 Like 'dro and gin go together, you a mind shifter 
 Body dark like a Cognac, I'm pissy drunk 
 In light ??, I stay drunk 
 My pretty little vampire, my delila 
 Teach me how to hate the truth and how to love a liar 
 You a vicious mind-bending ?? 
 You the perfect drug, ultimate high, and I'm a fiend 
 (Killer Mike) 
 You're my path to the pen or the crazy house 
 I deliver dick raw and won't take it out 
 Either that or you the devil's daughter, can't fake it 
 Killing me slow, I know and I can't shake it 
 Please stay, please leave, please don't go 
 Please walk away and let me be to die slow 
 This love is deeper than the grave and it's forever 
 Snake pit, you're venom beyond measure 
 Pandora's box a lot, my treasure 
 If love is strong as the grave, make me deader 
 Jezibelle got my soul and my cheddar 
 Everytime I beat it down, it jumps wetter 
 Like a dark cloud, bringing me pain and bad weather 
 I remain inside of your rain with no umbrella 
 I couldn't write the words, I blame this letter 
 Till death do us part, we deserve to be together 
 (Killer Mike) 
 A living drug, you're the bitch I hate to love 
 Learned to suck good dick by fuckin' thugs 
 A nigga can't teach you, spread like a track meet 
 Breaking D-boys, MCs, and athletes, but not me 
 Told you from the start this shit is forever 
 We gon' go through this bad weather together 
 Whether the road or high side, you gon' ride 
 Through the fistfights and black eyes, it's you and I 
 Ike and Tina, our love is measured on a milimeter 
 They say a partner don't love a nigga till a nigga eat her 
 But I'm raw, and tired of the motherfuckin talking 
 I'll be goddamned if you hit the door walking 
 I'm stalkin, the depths of Atlantis, evil enchantress 
 Slick and underhanded 
 Fuckin' with you like dancing with the devil, no command bitch 
 No ?? leaving niggaz empty-handed 
 I lost everything I had just to lust you 
 Bitch, you take another step and I'll bust you 
 Bitch you take another step and I'll bust you"

 Yeah 
 It's going all the way down 
 Aquemeni Records, Killer Mike, Slimm Calhoun 
 Just because your wearing a Braves' jersey 
 Doesn't mean we on the same team you playin' on bitch 
 Cool and Dre on the track, run it 
 (Verse 1: Killer Mike) 
 Since last heard I'm still Randy Moss 
 And I still catch a beat runnin' when its tossed 
 And often light green kiss my ass to coffin 
 Cut the bull in Harlem on sloughths (?) and 
 Cut the bull then I'm seven duece Impala whore dance 
 Ambidexterious juggle pretty girls and they friendly fifty friends 
 Hit Jamacia rollin' papers turning up spotta benz 
 City corners I've been in a duece double O three Benz 
 I'm sittin' on those dubs twins 
 I'm from the city where kiddies ride on dope rims 
 It's where niggaz snap shot and they ain't takin' pictures mista 
 I'm well equipped to hit ya', same birthday as Hitler 
 I'll getcha 
 (Chorus: repeat 2X) 
 Hey we rep that A 
 A T L A N T A state of G A 
 G A G A home of the brave 
 Home of the brave G A G A 
 Home of the brave 
 (Verse 2: Killer Mike) 
 I got a Tahoe, and a Tahoe 
 She work out fit like Taebo 
 Get my findy (?) Air Force Ones 
 Shit wait I'm so old 
 Last one to Louie Fitoine skins on my timbo's 
 Gettin' blown in a limo, that's my M.O. 
 Roll next presidential, get a pistol to your temple 
 I'll let it faint, leave your brain lingering in limbo 
 Southern fried that's how I ride, creed on simple 
 Kill 'em all let God separate good from evil 
 You faggots do it for glory 
 Y'alls just do it for my people 
 I'm grand national built beautiful and legal 
 (Verse 3: Slimm Calhoun) 
 A town down Braves started cap from the land of the made 
 Ain't no hard atrap after depts of the dungeon 
 We livin' artifacts where niggaz rip chickens 
 Talk bricks, keep an artist strapped 
 Flame throwers got us hot in the spot 
 Wreckin these dog tails through red dog stripe 
 It's like all hell, block cells 
 Make bail and it's back to these crooks and cakes jumpin' at next cell 
 What you know about the way the whales 
 Kiss it your body scaled 
 I'm 'bout to hit by the box of tens through the mail 
 Then reply beaten twelve sickness spinnin' on twenty-ones 
 We produce many guns, we spittin' at anyone's 
 Disrespect (?) little bows 
 And I'll cock and explode up 
 Take me to the grave, grave, home of the brave 
 (Killer Mike) 
 So slums, so sligh, nigga (I'm) straight ducked 
 You can ask my baby's mother she'll tell you niggaz shit 
 He the type to fuck a bitch 
 Rob that bitch's baby brother 
 (Slimm Calhoun) 
 And I'm the type to rip ya bitch leave the shit up under your covers 
 (?) Blessing from sin 
 New recrutes we in it again 
 Rap so hard we flippin' again 
 Walkin' dubs on the benz 
 (Killer Mike) 
 One, two, crack fiend 
 Three on boys street jeans 
 Four full blown hit the scene 
 Five like trap (?) 
 Like a thick hoe in sassy jeans 
 Rub her right she'll cream 
 Fuck her right moan and scream 
 Killer kill out on (?) 
 (Slimm Calhoun) 
 Swervin', servin', bouncin' the buttons 
 Like 5 5 9 truck somethin' 
 Two glock nines round dumpin' 
 Round my hip strap ain't jumpin' 
 Keep my bitch dunkin' somethin' 
 Be outlawed bangin' 'em down for bustin' 
 (Chorus) - repeat to fade"

 When a scrap rund up shoot him in the brain 
 With no hesitation were in this killer kali nation

11,Killer Mike,hiphop,Dragon,"*Heart beats* 
 *Woman sings in background as the Intro begins* 
 Ryan pump blast shattered glass in the classroom 
 Penny tried to hide in a bathroom, 
 Homicide scream from the hand held dragon 
 Mental flame from the barrel claim 25 angel, mercy 
 Long as the black board, splatter with his inside 
 Never had a chance to ride his new skateboard 
 Billy didn't shake lord, he fell silent 
 Died in the pantomime of cold violence 
 His killer didn't even blink, he couldn't think 
 Even when he heard the sirens kept firing 
 Pupils dilated, possessed and perspiring 
 He grew up admiring, 30 auts and calicos 
 AR-15 and long barreled 44's so on the story goes 
 He went out in a blaze of glory 
 He went out in a front page story 
 He went out in a front page story 
 My soul can't rest today 
 I can't bring myself to pray 
 I get down on my knees 
 Cause you will always be six feet under me 
 (Verse One) 
 Frank, I'm sorry you didn't get to see your cell phone tape, hear yourself 
 But to the mother fuckas who took Frank Williams AKA Fast Black, FUCK YOU! (Gunshot) 
 Dear God, I've messed up again, I'm sassed up again 
 Vodka spilling out my mouth onto my chin 
 I've slipped into the darkness of the heartless 
 Those barbarians carry savage weapons and they start shit 
 They hearts is cold as the artic, these men motivate mobs to lynch 
 These monsters are men, who I hang with 
 These monsters of then are who I bang with 
 Who I bang with, Crips, Bloods, BG, VL we have created our own road to hell 
 We train to kill and not to feel, reacting with a mac 
 But no matter who I kill I can't bring my nigga back 
 My niggaz dead and I can't get my fucking head around it 
 We was just smoking blunts of the best chronic 
 And now I'm wearing a t-shirt with his picture on it 
 Staggering about to vomit, consumed with vengeance 
 With my vengeance I'm all consumed, by mid afternoon smoking blunts in my room 
 To whom ever this letter may concern 
 When bullets strike they burn more than the flesh of the ones hit 
 You took my nigga my heart split, its broken, shattered in a million pieces 
 Help me Jesus, help me Jesus, just help me Jesus, thug niggaz killers 
 They victims was screaming help me Jesus 
 My soul can't rest today 
 I can't bring myself to pray 
 I get down on my knees 
 Cause you will always be six feet under me

 Put the city back on top, just separate the fools now 
 We had lots of misrepresentation but hey we cool now 
 Can't keep playin' both sides of the fence, you got to choose now 
 The realest of the real or the fakest of the fake 
 If ya got it on ya chest, shawty say it to my face 
 When ya hold ya nuts in hatred, ya only rushin till ya waste 
 And we gon' show them people what it really is in the A

 Straight from Atlanta, the hog hand-ler 
 Grown folk trap, scramb-ler

 This Re-Akshon, Killa Kill, T.I.P., and Bun

 Bitch I'm coming live from the trunk and I thrive on the funk 
 'Cause I'd rather die like a man than survive like a punk 
 I'm no coward, I'm 'dro-powered, you gettin' Twin-Towered 
 Devoured - it's a shit-storm and you bout to get showered 
 From Broward county to Harris, Pasadena to Paris 
 I embarrass niggaz on chrome wheels as big as the ferris 
 'Cause there is, now way now how - I stay low-key, low-brow 
 In that black on black on black in the 'lac 'cause I'm so wild 
 I get, drunk off that, I'll be high off this 
 I might pop one of those, it don't matter my nigga - I don't miss 
 They put me hot on list, where players are posted 
 But them players we posted up on corners, when they say and get roasted 
 And the prayer get toasted, 'cause I keep the flame on 
 The face for the game on - leave a stain on anything I puts my name on 
 Disrespect and the tech'll peck a player like Woody 
 'Cause cain't nuttin keep a trill nigga down, ask Khujo Goodie 
 (Killer Mike talking) 
 All I gotta say is sucker emcees better run 
 The debate is now, who's the greatest emcee? 
 T.I.P., Killer Mike, or Bun? 
 We are not doing this for fun - this is a bloodsport 
 Emcees are dying, mothers are crying 
 And wack-ass niggaz will go out trying 
 It is officially a new day, I am officially the new mouth 
 And these are the emcees of the new south!"

 My story is, so glorious 
 Fat fly boy, young Notorious 
 Notorious, for move makin' 
 I got a pistol for a pen, cook bacon 
 I'm a young G 
 I'm a E.V., educated villain 
 Who fuckin' with me? 
 I'm a book reader 
 I'm a gang leader 
 Triple bang and salute when the gang see him 
 I'm in position that these other rappers envy 
 They major, broke, and I get rich indie 
 Yeah, I said I Get-Rich-IN-D 
 Trill definition of that G.R.I.N.D 
 God looked out, because my life changed 
 It weren't for rap, I'd have a job of sell cocaine 
 They say I celebrate the pusher, that's profane 
 I say to feed my babies y'all I'll do anything 
 I'll sell H, I'll sell C 
 Because Malik and I are grown and Mikey gotta eat 
 And I refuse, 'cause I promised I would not lose 
 Until I'm gone, I'mma give these sucka' niggas blues 
 Here come the blues, nigga! 
 Young Muddy Waters 
 In the club sweating hot with your smelly daughters 
 Young 8Ball, on my way to legendary 
 Even [?] will have to point and say, ""That nigga's very heavy!"" 
 To son me, you gon' have to get a Bun B 
 Because the Pimp C in me won't let you pump me 
 Aye watch your mouth nigga 
 I'm from the South nigga 
 And you might smell my cologne at your house nigga 
 Money, money, money 
 Seems that's all that I'm about, nigga 
 I got a bad queen 
 She want a lot of things 
 And she gon' have it all 
 Tear down the mall 
 Good riddance to my ex-bitches, I holla y'all 
 I see you and your new nigga at my show 
 He love Pledge 2, he love song 4 
 I love the West side, I love Zone 4 
 Dixie Hills, Simpson Road that's what I do it for 
 Martin Luther King, Bankhead and Ashby 
 But now it's Lowery 
 That's where the loud be 
 And everywhere I be that's where the crowd be 
 But I'm a street nigga, partner don't crowd me 
 And don't push me, and don't shush me 
 'Cause I'm the opposite of whatever is pussy 
 Ass nigga, you ain't talking cash nigga 
 Then it's lost in translation 
 Get up out my face and 
 Go to the room where the sucka' niggas sit 
 Sit around and talk some of that sucka nigga shit 
 The way y'all cackling [?] is like y'all sucking nigga's dick 
 No homo promo, but y'all suckas acting like a bitch 
 I fell off and came up again, I am 50 Cent 
 I know you don't love me 
 I'm black and I'm ugly 
 But I got money, so these fly bitches fuck me 
 And I got hits now, so you haters can't duck me 
 My life has turned to magic, this is David Copperfield 
 The pretty women hug me and beg for me to cop a feel 
 Them crackas call a nigga they want me to cop a deal 
 But I don't talk 360 unless we talking 'bout a mil 
 If they talking major money, we can talk and that's what up 
 If they ain't talking 'bout that then I remain indie as fuck 
 They say I'm underrated and they sorry for my loss 
 And I reply I'm sorry that y'all broke and got a boss 
 On Pledge 1 I told the world what I'm about to do 
 The blind couldn't see it so I showed 'em Pledge 2 
 God In the Building had to help 'em gain focus 
 Pledge 3 is here, I give you the magnum opus"
14,Killer Mike,hiphop,That's Life II,"Ms. Oprah, Mr. Cosby, I am right back at your ass 
 With all honor, Mr. Obama, please don't walk out so fast 
 I got a question, got a question, got a question for you all 
 Why when Oscar Grant got murdered, we didn't hear a peep from y'all? 
 We appreciate the way you delegate for Henry Gates 
 But what about your people slaving in these fields everyday? 
 We know that House got air conditioning and the sweetest lemonade 
 But don't forget your color, brother, we still muthafucking slaves 
 And that even go for Puffy who so muthafucking paid 
 That he's richer than these White folks or at least that's what he say 
 That's what he say, that's what he say, and them petty niggas love it 
 Think about it, what's a rapper standing next to Warren Buffett? 
 Ha ha ha, now you niggas are properly enlightened 
 You can disregard that sell-out shit that Jason Whitlock writing 
 You can disregard that racist shit that Glenn Beck is reciting 
 I'm the leader of the gang, tell them to get a mike 
 I was born and I was raised in the U.S.A. 
 And I done been around the world and back, what a day 
 So I done seen a lot of shit and I just want to say 
 That Lucifer is here to stay, so bitch, you better pray 
 I was born and I was raised in the U.S.A. 
 And I done been around the world and back, what a day 
 So I done seen a lot of shit and I just want to say 
 That Lucifer is here to stay, so bitch 
 What I'm touching on next, you might want to leave the kitchen 
 'Cause I'm touching on that touchy subject that they call religion 
 Kind of touchy like that religion that's touching on your children 
 But nobody want to talk about that, touching and feeling 
 On topics that they touching or talking about Jesus said 
 They liars like they father and sixes is in their head 
 Bishop Long, what is up with that monkey shit on your head? 
 Last I checked, vanity was a sin, the Lord said 
 On my life, I believe you put boys off in your bed 
 Though some New Birthers and Catholics ain't going to like what I just said 
 But before you fix your mouth and try to come with a retort 
 Please be advised that Jesus never took a plea in court 
 And he never had a plane, and he never had a car 
 And he never had a church that was visited by stars 
 But he did have love for the poor and the thieves 
 And he was in the street, kind of similar to me, nigga 
 Mr. Beck, Mr. O'Reilly, Mr. Limbaugh, Mr. Hannity 
 How could you sell white America your insanity? 
 You tell them that they're different and manipulate their vanity 
 When truthfully, financially their life is a calamity 
 Otherwise they wouldn't be listening to Dave Ramsey 
 So they're about as broke as the people that they don't want to be 
 Convincing them that rich Republicans is what they going to be 
 So they act like Ronald Regan and like him they're awful actors 
 Who look up to the rich like dumb kids look up to rappers 
 And that's about as dumb as a (donkey) pulling a tractor 
 Yes, that's a Democrat diss, I'm a detractor 
 So whether you vote right or vote left it's not a factor 
 When you ain't got no care for your health, Hey, this America 
 They going to put your ass in debt something terrible 
 So you can disrespect presidents and call them socialists 
 But Palin and Pelosi both going to have you broke as shit"

 To make it out the ice cold streets of the city 
 You better have a Christopher word game, witty 
 You better have a dance game similar to Diddy 
 Or play b-ball above the rim like Smitty 
 Josh, Chris Bosh, Pau Gasol 
 Or any other nigga that ball at all 
 I used to sell it white as Paul Wall 
 Gave my young boi three of them in the mall 
 And he gon' bring me $75K back tomorrow 
 You know what Bigga 'bout, you know what Bigga do 
 Ice water in my veins, heart pumpin' igloo 
 I'm familiar wit the money so who the fuck is you? 
 What the fuck you do? Where the fuck you from? Who you knowing? 
 Somebody get this nigga, I don't know him 
 And I'm 'bout to jet off on his ass like a Boeing 
 Going, going, going, gone song 
 (INTERLUDE 1 - Ric Flair speaking) 
 ""You don't like the the prestige that I have in life. You don't like the notoriety. You detest the fact that I got more cars than most of you have friends! I got a big house on the big side of town I got life pretty much the way I want it!"" 
 To make it out the ice cold streets of the city 
 Your mindstate gotta be as wicked as Fiddy 
 Can't love life suckling on mama's titty 
 Cause life is a bitch and a bitch ain't with it 
 You gotta have faith livin' life on Biggie 
 I'm ready to die for the money, who is with me? 
 Life after death, hey this must be hell 
 I asked for six figures, God gave back self 
 I'm on my way to heaven in a Porsche 911 
 Buried in my car, I'm surrounded by a harem 
 Surrounded by my brethren, my funeral is legend 
 Buried like a pharaoh with my jewelery in the desert 
 The government will hate me like Jesus, but fuck 'em 
 I did it for the grind, I did it for the hustle 
 I did it for the people on the bottom in the struggle 
 I did it for my comrades, did it 'cause I love 'em

 ""Custom made brother Woo! And I mean custom made! From the alligators to all that they can see right here. Ric Flair! There's only one. And I don't care if it's Tokyo, Japan; Greensboro; Richmond; Charlotte, North Carolina; Asheville; Atlanta, Georgia; Charlotte; L.A. I'm the man that's makin' it possible!"" 
 To make it out the ice cold streets of the city 
 You gotta politic your situations like Clinton 
 If you chase power you ain't gotta chase women 
 So take some advice, take cash over ass 
 When you get money you ain't gotta take shit 
 So, long as you broke she ain't gotta take dick 
 Capiche? 
 Now you know what motivate your beetch 
 Capiche? 
 Pay the mortgage or the pussy up for lease 
 Capiche? 
 Church ladies goin' gaga for the Gucci (Yah!) 
 Got two niggas, menaging for some Louie (Yah!) 
 Work with the keys, get acquainted with Alicia 
 And every other girl named Rihanna wanna meet ya 
 They in it for the money, not the swag or the features 
 Pretty parasites might suck you like leeches 
 Just some information for a student from a teacher 
 Real life shit, I'm Mike Bigga, nice to meet ya gone

 And the jobs ain't hiring, unemployment is gone 
 They going to repo your car and foreclose your home 
 Me I suggest you get yourself a shotgun 
 So when they come to evict you can make them run 
 The banks got bailed out but we still suffering 
 So I got a gun 'cause I've done had enough of them

 You and your folks love me and my folks 
 Me and my folks love you and your folks 
 Never was poor, that ever ever was poor 
 They say love Jesus and listen to your pastor 
 But Jesus told the truth and the pastor's a lying bastard 
 All he talk about is economic elevation 
 And all Jesus talked about soul salvation 
 Jesus sat with the sick and he walked with the poor 
 If he gave blood for our sins why we giving more? 
 I got some gangster disciples at church with me tonight 
 With five dollars worth of gas and a matchbook to light

19,Killer Mike,hiphop,God In The Building II,"God is still with me (He's still with me) [x4] 
 It's hot like Haiti down in Hades 
 The false prophet say the Lord has forsaken us black babies 
 To make it off a island in Mercedes 
 We going sell it white as Michelangelo's Christ 
 Babies need rice, the baby need beans 
 To feed our babies beans we might have to flip a bean 
 I have sold my people dope yet provided them with hope 
 Sinner and saint, yeah, I did 'em both 
 Yeah I sold a brick on a basketball court 
 And bought the uniforms for the basketball coach 
 Can't wash a way the blood so I put rings on my fingers 
 25 carats symbolize my redeemer 
 And my redeemer's blood is capable of taking Chris Dudus 
 Making him a savior of others 
 My God will take a Sual, fashion him a Pual 
 So only God can judge me and to hell with all y'all 
 I lift my eyes upon the hills 
 From whence cometh my health 
 Only God can judge me 
 And nobody else 
 I beat these streets to make the Devil a lie 
 Marching at hell to the gangster's eye 
 I can feel the fire still everywhere 
 If heaven got a ghetto I'm a make it there 
 The critics ask why Michael never blowed 
 Well, truthfully I met the Devil at the crossroad 
 He offered me success in exchange for my soul 
 He stripped me of my riches, broke me down like Job 
 First he took my car, and then he took my house 
 But he couldn't take the Lord's name out a nigga mouth 
 So then he took my friends, and then he took my fame 
 And then he had my former friends dirty up my name 
 And while he was lying/lion I was Daniel in the den 
 Walking with an angel, a testament to men 
 I can walk on water, I defy the odds 
 The Devil give you fame, but he can't defy my God 
 My God is amazing, I don't need the Masons 
 I just need the junkies and the liars and the thieves 
 I need the pimps, prostitues and pushers out the streets 
 That's where I'm seeking God 'cause that's where he found me 
 That's where I'm seeking God 'cause that's where he found me 
 Amen 
 They tried to tell me ""Don't make these kind of records 
 You're never going to be who you're suppossed to be"" 
 The record that people are most connected to is (God in the Building 1) 
 So I give you (God in the Building 2) 
 I'm a keep doing what I am doing 
 I'm a keep building my testament 
 My empire, my legacy, my way 
 Because I know God moves through me 
 God is in me at all given times 
 So some of you all can shortcut, take whatever road you like to 
 I prefer the high road (high road)"
20,Killer Mike,hiphop,American Dream Prelude,"""The American dream had a price tag and only one man in a million was hungry enough to pay"" 
 Hey man, you can save that morality for your minister 
 And you can save that speech for the sisters of the church 
 This is America, jack 
 This is all about corporate takeovers and money makeovers 
 Wealth matters and poverty doesn't 
 We all say we love Martin Luther King, but we all wanna live like Don King, don't we? 
 God bless America! God bless America! 
 Home of the Rockefellers, home of the Carnegies 
 Home of the end justifies the means, legitimized through larceny 
 ""Fuck the king! Fuck your taxes!"" is what they told their masters 
 Before they became our masters 
 So rebelling against power is natural 
 And being an outlaw is actually..."
21,Killer Mike,hiphop,American Dream,"My American dreams, my American schemes 
 Fueled by American greed 
 My American dreams, my American schemes 
 Fueled by American dreams 
 It's American me, it's American me 
 By any means necessary 
 American me, my American dreams 
 Fueled by American schemes 
 It's American me 
 In America the crooks get the castles 
 Never see a Rothschild or Rockefeller shackled 
 While Rockefeller Drug Laws keep us in a shackle 
 Eventually this weed'll be as legal as tobacco 
 By then every CEO I hope will be a black, though 
 Message to the felon, keep sellin', my brethren 
 The end of an era soon coming I tell 'em 
 Bumpy Johnson showed us the way, don't fail him 
 Big Meech united all the streets, they jailed him 
 Pablo fought the government so they killed him 
 Probably took his bricks and brought 'em to us to deal 'em 
 My critics say I celebrate the dope dealer ... probably 
 'Cause I'm pro whatever prevents me from feeling poverty 
 For the same reason Prescott Bush worked with Nazis 
 The same reason Kennedy's dad ran the rum 
 By any means necessary I will overcome 
 You become a sociopath flipping birds 
 The same mindstate it takes to build a Bilderberg 
 Or an Enron or any other big con 
 That could fleece a million people out of billions 
 I'm trying to get a cheaper price, you know, a bigger bag 
 Mexican work... how American is that? 
 As American as steering in a German car 
 Fucking a Russian chick snorting coke from Colombia"
22,Killer Mike,hiphop,Follow Your Dreams,"(Intro, spoken) 
 The world fears a person with a dream. 
 Because to have a dream gives you the ambition to wanna fulfill wanna that dream 
 And if you live your life fulling that dream, you're gonna glow man. 
 Because there's a magnificence in the moment that comes with fulfilling you dream that you can't achieve being a part of someone else's 
 Follow your dreams no matter what people may say. 
 They gonna talk they gonna front they gonna hate at the end of the day its between you and God cause you know what it takes 
 Follow my dreams and get right back down, two steps forward three steps back round. 
 They keep pulling, I'm pushing, I'm shoving, they showing no love - oh God I need you right now 
 You got famous your love came back up, that's insane 
 The same as you must be to be in this game 
 In this game you suffer, hit strangers 
 Like Usain you bolt towards your dream 
 But haters speak disdain 
 Know my name and your name 
 But one thing's for sure man 
 Success is a sickness and there ain't no cure, man 
 Cure all is work hard and don't take no tours off 
 And even on off days you came back like you're off 
 The payoff is tenfold in dollars and euros 
 Pitfalls of vanity, pride, and your ego 
 Just let go and live up to your full potential 
 What they say is hearsay, it's inconsequential 
 But naysayers say no, but they are so simple 
 That they judge appearances and can't touch the mental 
 They are sheep, they follow shepherds of men 
 Or Malcolm, or Martin; I follow my plan 
 Do it for family, but they don't believe 
 That dreams that you have can even be achieved 
 Get ready young sailor, here's rough on the seas 
 Can't let no doubt or self-pity drown me 
 It's design when you sign and the vultures appear 
 And if you should succeed, it gets worse by the year 
 But the worse curse is failure, it kills by the day 
 Watch your dreams and ambitions as they fade away 
 See, my curse is I'll verse in these verses I verse 
 Will still be overlooked like a body in hearse 
 But this Lazarus rap and this is my rebirth 
 And no paper, just my dream on verse 
 The boot lady told me she dreamed I was cursed 
 Told her, if you can't tell I returned to Earth 
 Returned to the dirt, returned to the essence 
 Cause no weapon formed that gives me a succession 
 (Outro, spoken) 
 I hope you've learned about the business of chasing your dreams out there. 
 I hope you're chasing your dreams till you're exhausted, till your feet hurt, till your bones ache, 
 And till you get it, you're hoping that you won't let it go. 
 I want this to be more than good music to you, I hope it's inspiration for you. 
 Chad Butler told me a few years back, ""fight for your dream, Michael, like a drowning man fightin' for air."""

 One hundred percent grade A killer 
 Something like the bitch that I keep in Villa Rica 
 But I'm a be quiet 'cause they might Mike Vick ya

 Smoking one deep homie 'cause I don't fuck with you

 Hardcore G shit, homie, I don't play around 
 Ain't shit sweet 'bout the peach -- this Atlanta, clown 
 Home of the dealers and the strippers and the clubs, though 
 Catch you coming out that Magic City with a snub, ho 
 Lurking in the club on tourist motherfuckers 
 Welcome to Atlanta -- up your jewelry, motherfucker! 
 These monkey niggas looking for some Luda and Jermaine 
 And all a nigga found was a Ruger and some pain 
 Pow, motherfucker, pow! Come up off the chain 
 Pow, motherfucker, pow! One off in the brain 
 We some money-hungry wolves, and we down to eat the rich 
 Your bodyguard ain't shit, we strip him like a stripper bitch 
 These real-ass killers move in silence with violence 
 The minute it set off, we the motherfucking wildest 
 How you from Atlanta that they never speak upon 
 Where everybody got a sack of dope and a gun 
 (Hook: Trouble) 
 And you know just how it go 
 We ain't playing round with that bullshit 
 Nigga, we ain't let that shit go 
 When you come here, you better come correct 
 This real G shit, you gotta show respect 
 (Verse 2: Bun B) 
 Once upon a time in the projects 
 An O.G. saw a young Bun B as a prospect 
 Thought that I would understand the streets from a very young age 
 So he opened up the G code to the front page 
 He sat me on the porch, said, ""This where little dogs sit"" 
 Pointed at the yard, said, ""That's where big dogs shit"" 
 He said, ""Don't leave till your ass get growed 
 And don't come back till your ass get throwed 
 Whatever you want is whatever you can have 
 Bring the pain and leave 'em wet, like they soaking in some salve 
 When you step out on the ave, make sure they wanna see ya 
 Cause being trill is an onomatopoeia 
 Be about it like a G, a hater wanna catch you slipping 
 Try to be a Jordan, but settle for a Pippen"" 
 Player, I ain't even tripping, but I don't really care 
 Cause my pistol's in your face, so put your hands in the air 
 (Verse 3: T.I.) 
 In a six, I'm riding with a pistol grip, banana clip 
 From Simpson Road to Adamsville, I'm repping this Atlanta shit 
 Nigga trying to handle up, let's see can they handle this 
 A hundred round at em, that ain't no Louisiana shit 
 Drinking on that Hennessey, blowing on that cannabis 
 Amerikkka's nightmare, trap nigga fantasy 
 A record full of felonies, searching for a better me 
 But choppers go off in my hood like Iraq, Cuba, Tel Aviv 
 Pretty nigga, let him be -- fuck him, shorty 
 Sucker nigga I'll never be, don't give a fuck about it 
 Quick to round up on that Audi, make 'em get the fuck up out it 
 Nigga better be about it, he deserve it he allow it 
 What's a coward to a kamikaze? 
 He ain't robbed a man, ain't predator or prey; the law of nature where I stay 
 I catch you slipping with that K, ain't no illusion, no confusion 
 Better come up off that cake and all that jewelry or you're snoozing 
 (Verse 4: Killer Mike) 
 Wha-da-da-dang, wha-da-da-da-da-dang 
 Listen to my clip before that five go bang 
 Bang bang, Grindtime, rap game 
 We the readers of the books and the leaders of the crooks 
 Predators, we eyeballing all of y'all lames 
 Let me fall off, I'm taking all of y'all chains 
 All of y'all watches and all of y'all cars 
 Well, who you talking to? All of y'all stars 
 All of y'all rappers and producers and such 
 No homo promo, homie, you might get your ass touched 
 Like Def Jam circa '83, you get rushed 
 If you rolling with some winners, then you rolling with us 
 I know some dumb country niggas, but them niggas ain't we 
 Know they dressing looking hard, but them niggas ain't cheap 
 I don't make dance music, this is R.A.P 
 Opposite of the sucker shit they play on TV"
25,Killer Mike,hiphop,Untitled,"You are witnessing elegance in the form of a black elephant 
 Smoking white rhino on terraces 
 Will I die slain like my king by a terrorist? 
 Will my woman be Coretta, take my name and cherish it? 
 Or will she Jackie O, drop the Kennedy, remarry it? 
 My sister say it's necessary on some Cleopatra shit 
 My grandmama said nope, never, that it's sacrilege 
 Tend to agree because the thought is so disparaging 
 The Lord give a load, you got to carry it like Mary did 
 That's why I'm giving honor to all these baby mommas 
 It takes a woman's womb to make a Christ or Dalai Lama 
 The world might take that child, turn that child into a monster 
 The Lord'll take a monster and fashion him a saint 
 I present you Malcolm X for those who saying that He can't 
 Saying that He won't, when I know He will 
 You usually don't know it's you until you getting killed 
 For real

 Dear Lord, have mercy 
 On the ones that go through life like it's a game 
 We love 
 I won't be forced to shut up when I don't feel the same 
 Cause people gonna lie 
 Some people gonna steal 
 You gotta be careful not to shit where you live 
 Them people might try to have you killed 
 Lord have mercy, life is such a battlefield 
 For real

 I never did and never will 
 Live my life on press appeal 
 Keep it true, keep it real 
 Better said, I keep it trill 
 And no matter who don't like it, homie 
 That's just how it is 
 Naked truth like the stripper that's in front of me 
 And I keep a blunt and a Bible and a gun on me 
 Why? 'Cause I'm country-bred 
 Actually, I'm south-er-ern 
 Something like my brethren 
 The legendary Andre 3K, Cee Lo, Goodie, and some other men 
 You should pay some homage, it's an honor this 
 This is not a fiction that is sold by conglomerates 
 This is Soul of Black Folks mixed with Donald Goines shit 
 Better said, Robert Beck, esoteric I could get 
 This is John Gotti painting pictures like Dali 
 This is Basquiat with a passion like Pac 
 In a body like Biggie, telling stories like Ricky 
 If a rapper was to spar, please tell him better kick it 
 You with me? 
 (Outro: Killer Mike) 
 I don't trust the church or the government 
 Democrat, Republican 
 Pope or a bishop or them other men 
 And I believe God has sustained you with rap 
 So I pick a burning bush, put it in a Swisher wrap 
 And they can't kill a G, I seen how I die 
 I'm only going once, a coward dies a thousand times 
 And to that chariot come and take a nigga home 
 I'mma spit this ghetto gospel over all these gutter songs 
 I'm gone"

 We gang-stars like Preem and Guru cause respect was hard to earn"
28,Killer Mike,hiphop,JoJo's Chillin,"(Intro: Killer Mike) 
 This album was created entirely by Jaime and Mike 
 (Verse 1: Killer Mike) 
 My man JoJo got a caught on fed photo 
 So he gotta get out of Atlanta hit SoHo 
 Baby mama say he been selfish, he like ""so ho?"" 
 Then he picked up the cell phone called his old ho 
 She took him to the airport, hit him with some bread 
 Parked in the deck, then hit him with some head 
 Hit the counter with the fake ID and the ticket 
 The old man little suspicious but he hit him with a fifty 
 Hit him with a hundred, hit him with the ""Shhh..."" 
 The old man stamped the ticket and he went like ""Shhh..."" 
 Then he hit him with the smile, and he hit him with the wink 
 And JoJo hit the bathroom, JoJo hit the sink 
 Cold water, had to splash on the face 
 His iPod pumping Snoop ""Murder was the Case"" 
 Oh shit, looked to his left, Ghostface 
 ""Peace God, Peace God, where's Shallah Rae?"" 
 ""Think he had show down in M.I.A today"" 
 Ghost told him ""nice Wallies"" then went out on his way 
 Now it's back to reality, reality say: 
 Still gotta make it to that side of the gate 
 He moves out the bathroom quickly with haste 
 And it's a long line, it's a while before the gates 
 And it's an old lady giving Jo the evil eye 
 Mad 'cause she see him cutting spaces in line 
 JoJo's Chillin' 
 (Verse 2: Killer Mike) 
 Back in line JoJo spot Ivy 
 Girl from the hood that he knew from NYC 
 TSA agent so she cleared him on the ID 
 Before he go through X-ray he taking off his shades 
 Taking off his jacket, arm out the sleeve 
 Reached in his pocket, oh shit got weed 
 He done made it this far, what's Jo to do? 
 So he stuffed it in his pocket 
 And he walked right through (He walked right through?) 
 He walked right through 
 Then the TSA agent say ""She pointing at you."" 
 The old lady that had seen Jo cut line 
 Went to a officer and tried to drop dime 
 But Ivy wasn't having that, stepped to the copper 
 Told him that the old lady's ID wasn't proper 
 Now the old lady getting treated like a terrorist 
 Cop got his hand where her grey pubic hair it is 
 After this though she gonna have to see a therapist 
 JoJo found the situation hilarious 
 Threw the old lady's deuces, heading to the train 
 Concourse A, headed to his plane 
 Arrived on time, they called the first class 
 Upgraded ticket took a little more cash 
 Jo's relieved, hes almost free 
 Can't wait to land in the NYC 
 (Verse 3: Killer Mike) 
 Seat belts on, seat back up 
 Triple shot of Seagram's in JoJo's cup 
 A little too much he felt the stewardess up 
 She said ""Stop, sir!"", he looks like ""What?"" 
 Gave a big tip then he headed to the bathroom 
 When he got there told her ""Hey, it has room"" 
 Turned the bathroom into a smashroom 
 She was hitting lines he was hitting from behind 
 Look up in the mirror saw Ghost another time 
 ""Peace god, pardon god, I ain't see ya Wis' 
 Lean toward the mirror 'cause I gotta talk biz"" 
 Ghostface told him only 20 to LaGuardia 
 When you get there a car take you to Astoria 
 You don't want the alphabet boys on call 
 So tell the stewardess to make a wheelchair call 
 Wheelchair came, deboard plane 
 Jojo couple old folks and they canes 
 Exiting the door he seen a dog walking slow 
 Couldn't dump the weed, nowhere to go 
 Turns out the dog sniffed out that blow 
 Good thing the stewardess a cokehead ho 
 'Cause they bumrushed the bitch 
 And threw her ass to the flo' 
 Jo told the wheelchair boy ""Let's go!"" 
 And Jo got away that's how the story go"
29,Killer Mike,hiphop,Reagan,"Our government has a firm policy not to capitulate to terrorist demands. That no-concessions policy remains in force, despite the wildly speculative and false stories about arms for hostages and alleged ransom payments, we did not, repeat, did not trade weapons or anything else for hostages, nor will we 
 The ballot or the bullet, some freedom or some bullshit 
 Will we ever do it big, or keep just settling for little shit 
 We brag on having bread, but none of us are bakers 
 We all talk having greens, but none of us own acres 
 If none of us on acres, and none of us grow wheat 
 Then who will feed our people when our people need to eat 
 So it seems our people starve from lack of understanding 
 'Cause all we seem to give them is some balling and some dancing 
 And some talking about our car and imaginary mansions 
 We should be indicted for bullshit we inciting 
 Hand the children death and pretend that its exciting 
 We are advertisements for agony and pain 
 We exploit the youth, we tell them to join a gang 
 We tell them dope stories, introduce them to the game 
 Just like Oliver North introduced us to cocaine 
 In the 80s when the bricks came on military planes 
 A few months ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best intentions still tell me that's true, but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not 
 The end of the Reagan Era, I'm like 'leven, twelve, or 
 Old enough to understand the shit'll change forever 
 They declared the war on drugs like a war on terror 
 But it really did was let the police terrorize whoever 
 But mostly black boys, but they would call us ""niggers"" 
 And lay us on our belly, while they fingers on they triggers 
 They boots was on our head, they dogs was on our crotches 
 And they would beat us up if we had diamonds on our watches 
 And they would take our drugs and money, as they pick our pockets 
 I guess that that's the privilege of policing for some profit 
 But thanks to Reaganomics, prisons turned to profits 
 'Cause free labor is the cornerstone of US economics 
 'Cause slavery was abolished, unless you are in prison 
 You think I am bullshitting, then read the 13th Amendment 
 Involuntary servitude and slavery it prohibits 
 That's why they giving drug offenders time in double digits 
 Ronald Reagan was an actor, not at all a factor 
 Just an employee of the country's real masters 
 Just like the Bushes, Clinton and Obama 
 Just another talking head telling lies on teleprompters 
 If you don't believe the theory, then argue with this logic 
 Why did Reagan and Obama both go after Qaddafi 
 We invaded sovereign soil, going after oil 
 Taking countries is a hobby paid for by the oil lobby 
 Same as in Iraq, and Afghanistan 
 And Ahmadinejad say they coming for Iran 
 They only love the rich, and how they loathe the poor 
 If I say any more they might be at my door 
 (Shh..) Who the fuck is that staring in my window 
 Doing that surveillance on Mister Michael Render 
 I'm dropping off the grid before they pump the lead 
 I leave you with four words: I'm glad Reagan dead 
 Ronald Wilson Reagan 
 Ronald Wilson Reagan 
 Ronald (6) Wilson (6) Reagan (6) 
 Ronald (6) Wilson (6) Reagan (666)"
30,Killer Mike,hiphop,Don't Die,"Hahahaha Real bad guy shit 
 Hahaha Living like a villain 
 Never chilling heavy influence on your chillun 
 Yeah! 
 I woke up this morning to a cop with a gun 
 Who told me that he looking for a nigga on the run 
 I thought for a second and I screwed my face 
 And asked the dirty pig ""Why the fuck you in my place?"" 
 He said ""Chill or we kill, this is a warning"" 
 Then I told him ""fuck you, Where is the warrant?"" 
 Then they got to punchin' and kickin' and masin' 
 Then the Whole situation went Larry Davis 
 Thinking 'bout my lady and thinking 'bout my baby 
 Thinking ""is these motherfucking pigs going crazy"" 
 They wanna kill a nigga 'cause a nigga's on this rap shit 
 Wanna leave me dead on a mattress, Hampton 
 I'm a Public Enemy because I'm Cold Lampin' 
 And I don't give a fuck about a party in The Hamptons 
 And I don't give a fuck about a motherfuckin' Forbes List 
 Far as I'm concerned, that's a motherfucking whores list 
 Motherfucker, my dad was a cop 
 You don't think I know a dirty ass cop when I see one? 
 Shake down, take down, disrespecting-the-badge-ass-bitch! 
 Back to the scene going wild in the bedroom 
 Grab the cop's gun left from leaking with a head wound 
 Second cop shot, but the bullet hit his partner 
 Shot him in the leg and he hit him in the artery 
 Now the dirty cop's looking at me 
 Talking 'bout he kill a nigga if I try to flee 
 Shit, I'm about to lose it, so he gon' have to prove it 
 All because the government hate rap music 
 I've been labeled outlaw, renegade, villain 
 So was Martin King, so the system had to kill him 
 A nigga with an attitude, the world gotta feel him 
 Educated villain, Intent on living 
 If I gotta kill a cop just to get out the building 
 That motherfucker gettin' left dead no feelings 
 Yelling ""Fuck him"" as I buck A 45 at his fillings 
 Trying to knock his brains through the motherfucking ceiling 
 When I surface on the streets I can hear the crowd yelling 
 And see the neighborhood snitches pointing and telling 
 I'm bailing like a felon or Assata Shakur 
 Before the law leave me stinking like a bag of manure 
 Like Jeriko One in the movie 'Strange Days' 
 They want a nigga dead 'cause the things that I say 
 Might make the youth go and pick up an AK 
 Tell the government ""Fuck you, no way"" 
 Like John Connor mama I be running everyday 
 'Cause if I get caught it's my life they terminate 
 Or stick me in a cell on Guantanamo Bay 
 All because a nigga won't submit and obey 
 I'll be an outlaw before I ever behave 
 And die a free man before I live like a slave 
 Nothing changes, if they catch me today 
 ""Fuck the police"" is still all I gotta say"
31,Killer Mike,hiphop,Ghetto Gospel,"And I'm seeking on the edge of my bed holding my head 
 Tryin' to make this cake like a baker 
 And get some bread 
 My mama said hustle and dust come with fed 
 Time do the crime you'd better had be prepared 
 For what comes with it the killing the coke convictions 
 Snortin bitches just snitches often they get acquitted 
 While the real sent to prison, to rot away while they livin' 
 And all because I say dope shit they on a mission 
 To nail my black ass to the wall with a conviction 
 I pray the law hear me but really law isn't listen'n 
 Praying when I'm in trouble I'm speaking with forked tongue 
 I say I'm out the game but I'm flinching like George Jung 
 I must be in the clutches of Satan it's all warm 
 My mama took you to the ""root lady"" to read my palm 
 She puts beads on my neck saying they protecting me from harm 
 But fuck this old witch, I went and got a gun 
 Oh Lord, Jesus, glory 
 Oh Lord 
 Oh Lord, Jesus, glory 
 Oh Lord 
 Looking at the bezzle of my brighten 
 Thinking that I used to sell raps for enlightenment 
 But I got lapped by them guys selling lies for the white man 
 Now I sell pies for the white man 
 And my tour bus is a moving indictment 
 This must be how Huey felt when the revolution failed 
 And I open it and talk 'em on to a sack of Yale [?] 
 You know this feeling false but it feels like yeah 
 I may have lost my cause but not a reason to rebel 
 Revolutionary or drug dealer I'm in jail 
 And the seals call me nigga either way when I'm near 
 Just like they've being popped 
 Just like they being me 
 Just like they doin' to Lou or Osada if they see him [?] 
 And ain't no justice if it's just us accord[?] 
 For my folk and my people free Hoover or free forward [?] 
 The Lord never break us if we all don't wind on chord 
 You know 
 Oh Lord, Jesus, glory 
 Oh Lord 
 Oh Lord, Jesus, glory 
 Oh Lord 
 Even as I'm standing here iceless, mikeless, priceless 
 Women with me prettier than Isis 
 Don't know if she black or a white chick 
 But I know this pussy and excitement 
 Gonna lead to endictments 
 The women in the fame put shade on enlightenment 
 Other scene dark days come to many brightening 
 Out the scene the day I'm dime fine 
 As a fine wine taken nine stein mine 
 Leave 'em deaf dumb blind 
 Fuckin' with them jezebel horrors 
 Liars of Delilah even Mary Anne or Pandora 
 Pretty parasites she would use ya, this ain't what you used to 
 Stone cold bitch she Medusa 
 Dope ass pussy might make you an abuser 
 You an addict not in love what don't get it confused bro 
 She don't need a boyfried she just need a booster 
 She the devil's pie guy you was fucking Lucifer 
 Oh Lord, Jesus, glory 
 Oh Lord 
 Oh Lord, Jesus, glory 
 Oh Lord"
32,Killer Mike,hiphop,Butane (Champions Anthem),"(Verse 1: Killer Mike) 
 Looking for the truth, yeah it's me 
 Everythang polo to the floor, go even at the grocery store 
 It's so perfect, take a photo 
 And take the pic you buying bitch and so stitch you logo 
 Bitch you with the quatro, but my girl Mercedes 
 With the Audi say the quatro was a 
 You can put on, or fat boy or just Michael 
 Call me what you want but still never call me rival 
 They will call you dead and I will call you gone 
 The loss with Jesus we be will be we'll be calling you ass home 
 An underground rap, what I'm meant to be 
 Then I will be the shit and you ain't shit to me 
 We won, we the ones with the champagne, champagne 
 At the end of our campaign 
 Spit fire, naked truth like the blue flame, like the blue slang 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Let me see your hands up if you 
 And we bolt like Usain 
 More money, more problems, more butane 
 Burn the motherfucker down, down 
 (Verse: Killer Mike) 
 Life's a bitch so I mack on her immaculate 
 I don't wear no monkey watches 
 Rolex is too accurate 
 My rhymes are actually accurate 
 Meaning I don't fiction in my diction to the masses 
 Perfection is performed through many practices 
 I prostitute the mattresses 
 This shit just come naturally 
 Easy as Osama's bombers takin' many casualties 
 Like Columbine I'm down for mine I'm here to kill the faculty 
 Killin' them or killin' me 
 This is my soliloquy 
 Iller than the illest beat 
 I will spit the illest shit from right here to infinity 
 Till I reach the dirt 
 I will search the earth endlessly looking for the Hennessy? 
 Ain't nobody lyrically as ill as me, that's Eazy-E 
 Come back from A.I.D... S yes 
 Get a beat from E-L-P, ghostwritten for my partner T.I.P 
 Cube and me Every time, travel back to 95, jumping in a 63 Impala, playing Cuban Linx 
 (Verse 3: EL-P) 
 Yo, I'm a Grinch with a grin, I will shit on your kids 
 Get a light, get a grip, get a hold on my dick, bitch 
 Make a wish 
 I'm a knife, I'm nothing that's nicer then getting sliced up 
 The switch, the machete, the fatty Yeti, the shite 
 Getting closer to Christ yah 
 Might just find your design of your life an angel head short of divine love 
 I stink, I just stunk up a trunk to sell bricks 
 I'm a Sphinx, so much that my nose just broke off... think 
 I'm alone again clutching a loaded Glock soaked in chromium 
 Hoping that the thought police just don't bust in my home again 
 Life is tough, you get snuffed in [...] 
 What the fuck, this is not what my mother said I'll become 
 Star-spangled wranglers got my hopes on the run 
 Getting closer now 
 Maybe our society supposed to drown 
 Middle finger up on the Titanic as it's going down"

34,Killer Mike,hiphop,Willie Burke Sherwood,"No matter how good a woman is, she still can't really teach him to be no man or daddy 
 Used to walk around with a head full of naps 
 Chubby young kid with a head full of raps 
 Doing what he can, just trying to adapt 
 Jumped to the block off of grandma's lap 
 Jumped to the block, so did every emcee 
 But gotta tell the truth, yeah, the block wasn't me 
 Lookin' for adventure, but the block was not 
 The block was real, Woo got killed 
 Half a year later, Big Spank got killed 
 And I got robbed, and Ronnie got shot 
 And I bought my first tape by 2Pac 
 And I got hard, 'cause I was smart 
 I knew that the weak and the meek couldn't make it in the street 
 Had to assert yourself to survive 
 So I convinced myself it was better for me 
 To be Jack in the *Lord of the Flies* 
 It's a book I read, books I read 
 'Cause I'm addicted to literature 
 As a young boy rollin' 'round with the clique 
 Cause of that I was insecure 
 I was insecure 'cause I realized 
 Ain't no room for the civilized 
 When the wild men rumble in the jungle 
 And that's why Simon and Piggy died 
 Ralph survives, but he lives changed 
 Nothin's the same, shit'll drive a man out his brain 
 Drive a young man insane 
 My cousin Jimmy had a breakdown he ain't never been the same 
 And he never will be again 
 If I could fix his brain 
 Take back the crack in his mind 
 Give it all back, you can have the racks and fame 
 I'd give it all back in exchange 
 This is for the dads and the grandads 
 And the little homies that ain't never had dads 
 This is for the uncles and the OGs 
 And the lil homies, and the YGs 
 This is for the men I look up to 
 And all the struggles that the men had to go through 
 For every man that's ever had to man up 
 If that's you, let me see you put your hands up 
 I lost my youth, chasin' my youth 
 Made me a youth in the back of a coupe 
 Teenage love, like Slick Rick said 
 I hit her with my Dougie and I had a gold tooth 
 Fur Kangol, Filas too 
 She was light-skinned red gold tooth 
 But of course it didn't last 'cause I had to go to college 
 And she was still in high school 
 Damn, I'm a dad, this is bad 
 This ain't good, my baby's in the hood 
 And I'm walkin' 'round the black ivy league campus 
 Like I wish you house niggas would 
 So I go get a job, UPS 
 Where they treat you like BS and 
 You all know how the story goes 
 Drop out of college and sell 'ses 
 I figured I'd invest in studio time 
 Drop rhymes, have success 
 But, mostly I got fronted on, stunted on 
 Nigga dealt with some stress 
 I'll take that two, take that three 
 Cause my momma got to see me on TV 
 And my grandmomma got to get her Grammy 
 And my grandaddy got to see his boy eat 
 See his boy grow, I wish I never had that show 
 I wish you never had to go 
 Wish you could meet my wife, wish you could see my life 
 But you had to see the light 
 Wish I had you one more day 
 Wish I had tomorrow that's your birthday 
 We can sip gin, straight get fade 
 We can ride old schools through the trey"
35,Killer Mike,hiphop,R.A.P. Music,"I've never really had a religious experience, in a religious place. Closest I've ever come to seeing or feeling God is listening to rap music. Rap music is my religion. Amen 
 What I say might save a life, what I speak might save the street 
 I ain't got no instruments, but I got my hands and feet 
 Hands gone clap and feet gone tap, El-P beats to make that snap 
 And I ride them with my raps, and they all tight as my naps 
 And my naps is all I got, and this beautiful ebony skin 
 And the music in my heart, and the words put in the wind 
 And the words put in the wind, coming back like a boomerang 
 When I take this microphone, point it at the crowd, they start to sing 
 This is jazz, this is funk, this is soul, this is gospel 
 This is sanctified sex, this is player pentecostal 
 This is church; front, pew, amen, pulpit 
 What my people need and the opposite of bullshit 
 It's that Robert Johnson, that Muddy Waters, that James Brown, Augusta, GA 
 That Ray Charles, that Stevie Wonder, that Mayfield, that Superfly 
 That Willie Hutch and that Mack, it's that blues man, that soul man 
 That OutKast, that Southernplayalisticadillac 
 It's that Jimi Hendrix, that George Clinton, I feel it in my bones 
 Aretha Franklin, that Shirley Caesar, that Miss Nina Simone 
 That Sade, that Love is King, that Coltrane, that Love Supreme 
 That Miles Davis, that Bitches Brew, that ""beeeyatch"" said by Playboy Too 
 I got things to do, before I meet that glory in the sky 
 And my baby girl b-day be six months away, she gonna be five 
 So I pray to the lord he spare me, and I make it by and by 
 And I help souls stay out of Hell with what I testify 
 And maybe when I grab the microphone and never lie 
 That'll merit that he spare me, I won't have to feel that fire 
 So Killa Kill gonna spit that real on each and every song 
 And each and every poem, until the good lord call me home, gone!"

 Get to skipping 
 Not too tall dark and handsome man 
 But I talk dark for ransoms man 
 Spend grands of those zombies 
 Folded origami 
 Yes I bag the clams 
 Anyone object to the styles, get a smile and a backwards hand 
 Peep that felonious face in the place of an angel 
 Bringing that buckshot back to the table 
 Been a veteran, earthbound hellion 
 Try to say grace get a face full of staples 
 Woke up and the city air smelled like maple 
 If you come straight from New York you relate 
 If you come straight from another place stay too 
 Me and Mike got the whole map held safe 
 Be it NYC or the ATL 
 From the ceilings of heaven to the gates of hell 
 We murder death killed every stage we step 
 Homicide times two better warn yourself, El 
 Anybody looking for some trouble better self med 
 We could double dutch in a minefield, hell gets 
 Just the right temperature, break beat minister

 You don't wanna look into my big crystal balls, suck the future 
 We'll moonwalk through flames with a brain on stupid 
 Camouflage toughies'll touch your tufts roughly 
 Fluff your flat permanent, lump you up ruthless 
 Then laugh while you're humming the tune of bruised movements 
 That took a few too many tabs to prove lucid 
 (Everything compute?) Nah the truth is too tangled 
 And even a satellite sees at one angle 
 Burners radiate smoke till all's motionless 
 Hope? Nah, ha ha, slow down with the jokin' shit 
 So inappropriate, right behind your ears is a what? 
 Look: ta-dah! The sound of your hopelessness 
 I can feel it too, from the ground rising up in us

 When they hit the stage to accept the Source award 
 My heart dropped like a million other country boys

 Damn man, I miss the interludes by Big Rube 
 He gave us knowledge that they wouldn't give us in school 
 So our mind wasn't so sick 
 Speakin' of being sick man I need a doctor 
 Which doctor? Bring back the Witch Doctor

 I know how to fuck I know how to ride 
 I can spin around and keep the dick still inside 
 Now your mouth wide you looking real scared 
 I'm a man-eater headhunter I'm prepared

 Yeah you running now

 Put this pussy in yo jaws now smack

 Collard greens neck-bones nigga chew this ass 
 Both hold inspections don't stop till it pass 
 Licky licky licky licky licky for an hour

 Smell it like a flower my pussy is a rose 
 Come a little closer I wanna fuck your nose 
 (Chorus: Killer Mike)

 Third bred red broad in my bed 
 Up all night took pipe gave head 
 Ass like Trina face like Mya 
 Shot it on her chest she said daddy aim higher 
 Put jimmy on her titties and I bust off wicked 
 Gave her mayonaise on the face pearl necklace 
 We turned the camera on we did a sex scene 
 She call me R. Kelly and I call her 
 That's my bitch right there nigga 
 Hand full of ass and a fist full of weed 
 Ass in the air face down on your knees 
 I'm a beast when I fuck I'ma put it on your gut 
 I'ma have you saying no please let me get up 
 I'ma make you say that's the spot don't take it out 
 I'm feeling like Akinyele put it in your mouth 
 Kanye tell them gold digging hoes that we pimping in the south 
 And it ain't payday unless nuts in your mouth 
 Back it up drop down to your knees 
 Bring it up real slow make one cheek freeze [x2] 
 If you want it you can get it 
 If you with it I'ma hit it 
 Flip it rub it up and smack it 
 Look back at it I'm a addict

 Little dick nigga shit hurry up I gotta go 
 Since they in prison pussy nigga make me know 
 That you ain't a virgin and you done this before 
 Fuck me till you can't breath till you swim and scream help 
 It's your lucky day all the lifeguards left 
 (Trina talking) 
 Little dick ass nigga 
 You better get your face down here and eat this pussy 
 Dribble these titties on your lips 
 While you're doing that put your hand around my hips 
 Bounce me like a ball slam me like K-mart 
 On and off the dick better known for breaking hearts 
 Nigga call a cab I'm finna pack my shit and leave 
 Shouldn't have let you fuck now that's some shit I can't believe 
 Wasting my time fucking all off beat 
 Pussy nigga next time when you see me don't speak"

 Its some hilarious thangs boy 
 And it's a wild wild chain of events that gets yo ass in here 
 Momma I don't wanna sell 
 Birds no more (I gotta fuckin' funny story to tell y'all) 
 They pushed me down and locked me up 
 Put my face on the floor (you remember me and big paul and my whole crew) 
 They took my money and my credit card 
 Now I'm poor (government snitches are paid) 
 Momma I don't wanna sell 
 Crack no more (listen it gon take about 3 minutes just listen) 
 (Killer Mike) 
 After high school I gained lots a weight 
 And I ain't talkin' bout calories put on by state 
 The recipie I'm cookin may send me upstate 
 Use bakin soda cook the pie collect cake, not Pillsbury 
 These niggaz kick down doors find out where millsbury 
 Shits very intense and critical 
 And when we drew pistols shit got pitiful 
 The first leak was bullshit a half a brick 
 We robbed the middle man and a bum bitch 
 The dumb bitch 
 But between me and him and that whore 
 We walked away wit 18 and a bigger score 
 Some nigga named Salvator from El Salvador 
 Got silver teeth and a star on his jaw 
 Young Antonio Montana 
 Held up mansion North Atlanta 
 We hit 'em hard and stores hammer YEA! 
 Momma I don't wanna sell 
 Birds no more 
 (Ok I know wat you thinkin' its on right we on right we on) 
 They pushed me down and locked me up 
 Put my face on the floor

 I little spot had more birds than a pet shop 
 More guns than a Vietnam Vet 
 We was set 
 Loaded up the work and lets jet 
 My nigga Big Paul loaded up the uhaul 
 1000 pounds uncut raw 
 Hold on wats that I saw in the distance 
 Did he have a crew offerin resistance 
 Pauley said ""its probly nothin' 
 A small animal or somethin"" 
 My nerves got ta jumpin' 
 I swear I herd somethin' 
 I pointed the 4 fifth in the wind and start dumpin 
 Now blue light is comin' 
 My crew is runnin' 
 Cops is everywhere they keep comin' 
 All of us sick 
 And all of us caught holdin' our dick 
 We robbed the nigga the same day the fuckin' feds hit 
 We robbed the nigga the same day the fuckin' feds hit 
 Me and Salvador fucked up in the mix 
 That middle man the dumb bitch 
 Them niggaz snitched GOT DAMN! 
 Momma I don't wanna sell 
 Birds no more 
 (So young man this is why the fuck I'm sittin' here wearin this tan suit like this) 
 They pushed me down and locked me up 
 Put my face on the floor 
 (I hear Savador got extradited or some shit) 
 They took my money and my credit card 
 Now I'm poor 
 (The grown bitch was a snitch? who knows) 
 Momma I don't wanna sell 
 Crack no more 
 (Man I shoula fuckin' stayed in job court... 
 Stayed my fuckin' ass in job court doin' this dumb ass shit 
 Now I'm fuckin' around wit y'all stupid ass niggaz too 
 Ain't no niggaz in jail but dumb niggaz

 (You don't have to go home) 
 One time, one time - one time, one time 
 (Verse - Killer Mike) 
 Easy, that kush shit got me sleepy 
 Rollin' down 85, leaning but I ain't weaving 
 Man you, should stay a day in the A 
 A parade of them chevelots, the colors of flavor aid 
 Can you, believe I got it made 
 Impala in the garage, got Forces and all the J's 
 I'm leaning back, ride shotgun in the chevy with the homeboy burning sacs 
 We heading to the spot where we get down, nigga where the bitches at 
 If they talking right, acting right, walking right 
 Down to take flight, they ain't gotta go home, they can stay the night 
 You don't have to go home 
 You can stay right here, put one in the air 
 While we're bending corners on my chrome 
 Same shit another year, in the southern hemisphere 
 Wait a while, you don't have to go... 
 (Verse - Killer Mike) 
 Nigga hold up, hold up 
 Make sure they see you when you roll 
 Hop out that truck all ready fucked up 
 Toe up from the motherfucking blow up 
 From the floor up, to the ceiling 
 Smoke kiss in the walls in the top of the building 
 Lile momma's on e, sitting next to me 
 She's catching a feeling 
 And I'm feeling, like I'm 'pose to 
 I'm as fly as a Jordan poster 
 I'm leaning and breathe smelling like hen and a mix of hydroponic 
 By the the time my click find me in VIP I'm lost in a cloud of chronic 
 Had sex with the best, got head from the rest 
 Motherfucker believe I done it 
 (Verse - Big Boi) 
 Hot tub, tony sucka free and still bubblin 
 Truck still rattling and bumping now move something 
 (Verse - Killer Mike) 
 Hold up Big Boi! I'm still weed crumpling 
 The sac keeps shaking and block keep jumping 
 Lay back, lay back, treat this eight six cut like a Maybach 
 Hey show these suckas that after 50 million sold 
 Daddy Fat Sacs still where the hood at, hood at 
 (Verse - Big Boi) 
 Hood rats and decoy b-boys understood that 
 Whether its creme de la creme, where the good at 
 I got it in that 1.5, I had to put the swisha down cause my lugs got tired 
 Now lets ride, lets ride 
 (Verse - Killer Mike) 
 Back down 85, five 
 With the click in the truck, full of chicks in the back of the 6 
 Nobody going home tonight 
 You don't have to go home 
 Straighten up your hair, you don't need a mirror 
 You can fix your makeup in my chrome 
 Same shit another year, in the southern hemisphere 
 Wait a while, before you don't have to go... 
 Ah! It feels like ecstasy 
 The sound, whoa! feels like ecstasy 
 Ooh... ooh! feels like ecstasy (feels like ecstasy!)

 T.I.P., Mike, and Bun B - scared whatchu better be 
 We was just the kings, now we heads of a legacy 
 Leaders of the new south, fake niggaz move out 
 He talkin' loud and proud, but he scared with a tool out 
 I'm the nigga they be askin what we gon' do bout? 
 Mike told me ""fuck them niggaz, bring that New New out"" 
 Tank the Chevy, buy the Caddie, bring the 22's out 
 Put the city back on top, just separate the fools now 
 We had lots of misrepresentation but hey we cool now 
 Can't keep playin' both sides of the fence, you got to choose now 
 The realest of the real or the fakest of the fake 
 If ya got it on ya chest, shawty say it to my face 
 When ya hold ya nuts in hatred, ya only rushin till ya wait 
 And we gon' show them people what it really is in the A 
 (Killer Mike) 
 Straight from Atlanta, the hog hand-ler 
 Grown folk trap, scramb-ler 
 Knee deep, means to get them G's to my manager 
 My mack-10 made for action, body-baggin and throat braggin 
 I'll drag 'em threw the river like a bad yellow nigga 
 I'm mashin with pops fashion, bustin' first no questions askin 
 You gon' off that waterboat and thinkin' you can hold me 
 I'm, King Kong on every track, no cap-sule can hold me 
 I'll THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP, when I BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP! 
 It's woofers, tweeters, speakers, geekers, ALL IN YO' TRUNK! 
 My dad ain't raise no fag, my mom ain't had no punk 
 We don't hesitate or negotiate, we pop Chevy trunks 
 From the home of Coca-Cola, I'm not referrin to soda 
 I'ma grind till I shine, or die going for mine 
 Sick Sawyer buy my side, swervin and blowin' pine 
 Don't be a victim to a Killer, be a father to ya son 
 This Re-Akshon, Killa Kill, T.I.P., and Bun

 Bitch I'm coming live from the trunk and I thrive on the funk 
 'Cause I'd rather die like a man than survive like a punk 
 I'm no coward, I'm 'dro-powered, you gettin' Twin-Towered 
 Devoured - it's a shit-storm and you bout to get showered 
 From Broward county to Harris, Pasadena to Paris 
 I embarrass niggaz on chrome wheels as big as the ferris 
 'Cause there is, now way now how - I stay low-key, low-brow 
 In that black on black on black in the 'lac 'cause I'm so wild 
 I get, drunk off that, I'll be high off this 
 I might pop one of those, it don't matter my nigga - I don't miss 
 They put me hot on list, where players are posted 
 But them players we posted up on corners, when they say and get roasted 
 And the prayer get toasted, 'cause I keep the flame on 
 The face for the game on - leave a stain on anything I puts my name on 
 Disrespect and the tech'll peck a player like Woody 
 'Cause cain't nuttin keep a trill nigga down, ask Khujo Goodie 
 (Killer Mike talking) 
 All I gotta say is sucker emcees better run 
 The debate is now, who's the greatest emcee? 
 T.I.P., Killer Mike, or Bun? 
 We are not doing this for fun - this is a bloodsport 
 Emcees are dying, mothers are crying 
 And wack-ass niggaz will go out trying 
 It is officially a new day, I am officially the new mouth 
 And these are the emcees of the new south!"
52,Killer Mike,hiphop,Runnin' Out Of Bud,"Break it down, straight outta the tip 
 Flockin to the 'rillo 
 Ain't no secret 
 Every month, I'ma smoke a pillow 
 (M-J!) G, I keeps it real potent 
 Green-sticky that'll keep a buffalo chokin 
 Come and go with me, creep off in my Chevy thang 
 Doin' 45, twistin somethin' steady mayn 
 Headed to my low-key, safe-and-sound house 
 Call up the fellas, hit the spot, and pull a pound out 
 I used to have a secret spot up in my Range Rover 
 Where I kept me somethin' rolled, I'ma chain smoker 
 No discrimination my nigga, if you broke 
 But they still ain't attributed to good smoke 
 B.Y.O.B, bring ya own bud 
 Contribute to the pot, or do ya own drugs 
 But then I looked around and noticed all the folks was gone 
 I shoulda known that they would leave when all the smoke was gone 
 Man, my weed is smoked up 
 Man, my weed is smoked up 
 Man, my weed is smoked up 
 Man, my weed is smoked up 
 There ain't nobody left around 
 Nobody left around 
 Nobody left around 
 Nobody left around 
 Nobody left around 
 And I'm runnin' outta bud 
 I'm runnin' outta bud

 I gotta go to the corner sto' 
 Go to the corner sto' 
 Go to the corner sto' 
 Go to the corner sto' 
 Keep a fat bag, boys know I got that choker 
 Part-time rap nigga, full-time weed smoker 
 Wake up, before I wash the crust up out my eyes 
 I'm splittin a cigarillo, fiendin for my morning high 
 Break that sticky down, roll it up, let it dry 
 Strike my lighter, put it to the tip, then I 
 Inhale, and let the smoke smoke fill up in my lungs 
 Hold it for a second, blow it out and get numb 
 A drug-addict, I'm a junkie for that Marijuana 
 No mid-grade, or no regular, just straight chronic 
 At least four-hundred, for a zip, if I'ma touch it 
 See I'ma smoke it if I like it, I ain't got no budget 
 Now mama with me, wanna hit, better take it slow 
 Seen it befo', I'ma be gettin' this bitch up off the flo' 
 Burn it all till the whole bag empty 
 Now err'body gone, ain't nobody here but me 
 Yeah I smoke, and I drank 
 Yeah I pop, and I lean 
 Might see me on M.L. King 
 Burnin rubber, burnin green 
 Might see me, envisions with some pretty bitches, ballin g 
 Might see me, on TV, live on stage with Ball and G 
 Ridin' heavy in the Chevy, cruisin with a pound of purp' 
 This here is my personal nigga 
 This here is not for work 
 Years ago, I was broke 
 Couldn't smoke it, couldn't ride 
 Now I smoke that foreign weed 
 Now I push them foreign rides 
 Flyin in that G-4 
 Goin' to do them foreign shows 
 Givin' 'em my foreign clothes 
 Fuckin' with them foreign hoes 
 Catch ya man at Amsterdam 
 Burnin grams of that kush 
 Purple Haze and Indica 
 Now I'm drinkin' vinegar 
 Scared as hell my P.O. gon' pull me and make me piss in cups 
 But fuck the man, I'm the man 
 Right now I'm in Amsterdam 
 Spendin cash, burnin hash 
 High like a satellite 
 I might get locked up tomorrow 
 But bitch, I'm gettin' high tonight 
 I wanna get high 
 I'm gonna get high 
 I wanna get high 
 I'm gonna get high 
 I wanna get high 
 I'm gonna get high"

 I'm sick to the soul with hate 
 'Cause I'm the bitch that society raped 
 So what'a ya say?

 Along with Jon Newport's beer bottle caps and the Roaches of Will Power's blunts 
 So what'a ya say? 
 People is why shit is so wrong 
 Why they won't let all our soldiers come home 
 Why them boys who get caught with such small amounts of dope on the Ave do bids so long 
 They bids so long by the time they get to come home 
 Mamas is gone and babies is grown 
 And baby mama that was tight in that thong 
 Fat as a fuck and her body all gone 
 Pay for it cash her ass is gone 
 She never worked so the stash is gone 
 Government rations she gets on 
 Year after year she get check after check 
 A gangster come home already in debt 
 The government say you owe fifty K 
 For all the free lunches that yo baby ate 
 Do you go legit, and never have shit? 
 Or G' up and re-up and get you a brick? (yeah) 
 Get you a brick (yeah) 
 See what you suckas don't understand is
