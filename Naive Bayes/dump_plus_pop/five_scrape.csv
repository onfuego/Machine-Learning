 Come on baby dry your eyes, wipe all your tears 
 Never like to see you cry, please forgive me

 To fill the void while you were gone 
 To fill this space of emptiness 
 If 5 boys in da house say it loud 
 If 5 boys in da house check it out (x2) 
 When I lay upon my bed reminisce then I wish 
 That I got you by my side with the cherry red kiss 
 Hit me off make it soft hold me tight through the night 
 You know I'm gonna fight 'cause the thing we had was right 
 But if you go all I know I can't go a day without you 
 Here in my arms hypnotized with your charms now 
 I'm feeling for you baby ain't you hearing the alarms 
 You can't stop all the love that I got 
 Wanna rewind time to better days that were hot check it 
 Bring back the better days for me baby 
 You gotta bring 'em back 'cause I'm going crazy 
 I go insane with your name up in my brain 
 Things will never be the same you ain't up in my frame

 Tell me that you're gonna push your loving back my way

 Maybe one day you'll understand

 Until the time is through 
 I'll be waiting 
 How can I tell you 
 So that you can see 
 You know that 
 Love has a meaning 
 When you are here with me 
 Give me a moment before you go 
 There's something you ought to know 
 Baby now and forever 
 Until the time is through

 Waiting will never 
 Give up my faith in you 
 Trying to make it clear 
 Without your love I'd be half a man 
 Maybe one day you'll understand 
 Now and forever 
 Until the time is through 
 There is no one to comfort me 
 Here in my cold reality 
 I'm searching for words 
 What can I say 
 To make you see 
 Baby now 
 Until time 
 Is through 
 I'll be here 
 Baby now 
 Until time 
 Is through

 Feeling like we hit a brick wall

 That play upon my mind 
 Like thoughts of 
 You and I 
 You and I 
 It goes round my head like a carousel 
 And round and round my mind

 You and I 
 I know what to do when I'm not with you 
 I fill my mind with thoughts of 
 You and I 
 You and I 
 A simple need of love is what you bring 
 It plays on my hearts strings 
 Songs of love to be loved 
 Got me thinking of 
 Our moments that are gone but will not fade 
 And we live to be replayed 
 In my mind overtime 
 Like thoughts of 
 Well I know we'll make mistakes 
 But that's just the chance we take 
 I hope you'll never say 
 'Cause I'll never say 
 Goodbye 
 Say goodbye 
 To you and I (You and I)

 It's just something in me 
 I need to close another door 
 Live my life to suit me 
 I just can't hide the confusion that burns in my mind 
 Oh, no 
 Sometimes the pressure gets so high 
 Excuses come so easy 
 Just like a man lies to his wife 
 When honesty won't please her 
 I guess you'll find that I'm not what you think you can see 
 Not what you want me to be? 
 Stop pushing me 
 I gotta do it my way 
 Stop pushing me 
 Why don't you hear what I say? 
 Stop pushing me 
 'Cause we all learn from mistakes 
 Stop pushing me 
 I'm gonna do it my way 
 It seemed to me like it won't end 
 But it was never meant to 
 Be more than just another trend 
 A phase that I would go through 
 You still don't see that I'm not your little baby no more 
 No 
 So please don't force me down that road 
 I'll choose where I'll be going 
 You can't dictate another day 
 Don't make me spend one more when 
 I wanna fight for myself 
 And be debted to nobody else 
 No one but myself 
 My way is the only way I trust 
 My way whatever the cost 
 Now don't get me wrong 
 The respect hasn't gone 
 But when can I have my say 
 And do it my way?

 You taught me how to love 
 I am all I am 
 Because of you, just because of you (oh) 
 Everytime I lost my way 
 You shine a light, you made my day 
 You see me through, yes you see me through 
 So who's gonna come around to heal this broken heart? 
 Show me how to left and right 
 But never how to say goodnight 
 Some things can never be replaced

 You gotta get serious (c'mon) serious (haha) serious 
 Could I be the one that twists tighter than a curl 
 Coming through the mist

 On the double-o five mission 
 With the aim to please, any beef with the rod gone fishing 
 Check if you're down tonight put your hands in the air if you feel all right 
 Got enough for what you need so get serious, baby please

 You are the flavor to my song 
 That's why I wanna be, wanna be with you 
 Stop, clear the stage so we can get busy 
 Open up your mind while I hit you with the nitty gritty 
 We came to rhyme, we came to get down 
 Yo when we rock the mike we bring the funk into your town 
 So I drop a rhyme on the mike while it's mine 
 Then you gotta pass it on while I rock you with a line 
 As we hip, we hop we're getting others on the run 
 Flickin' switchers on the bottom of the mike 'cause we're done 
 Get serious, we've got it going on tonight 
 Get serious, everything will be all right 
 All I know is true that I wanna be with you 
 You gotta get serious (c'mon) serious (haha) serious

 'Cause see, we got each other 
 When things go down 
 And time is just too important to be messin around 
 So understand not what I'm trying to say 
 But appreciate living life day to day 
 So how does it feel to be the only ones 
 Left out in the rain 'cause you're phoney ones 
 Wake up and realise what you live is a dream 
 Ain't gonna be there for long even though it may seem 
 Like a never ending story 
 You in it for the money or the glory 
 Open up your ears or ignore me 
 All I'm tryin' to do is be the man I am and be the best in this world I can

 I'll hit you with a tale of how the five of us were meet up 
 We're just five guys who wanna rise to the skies 
 No... we got a vision in our eyes 
 Now people wanna step up and try to hold us back 
 They wanna try to stop us getting freaky on this track 
 But this is how we kick it and this is how we swing 
 And this is how I hit you with the funk that I bring 
 Now you gotta select to connect not disrespect 
 And you gotta learn to keep your negativity in check

 I'll put it down with my sound

 There are days that I can't forget 
 There are things that I now regret 
 I was there for you when you were there for me 
 And I was thinkin' we were set 
 Every night when I'm laying in my bed 
 I hear your voice going round in my head

 People stop and stare and look me up and down. 
 Now you shouldn't feel down from what everybody says, 
 And don't let it bother you if anybody stares. 
 'Cause you know that at times, people can be cruel. 
 Try to put you down, make you feel like a fool. 
 But you got one shot, now don't you ever stop. 
 Keep your dreams high, keep reaching for the top. 
 'Cause you know and I know if they had the chance, 
 They'd be climbin' up on the stage, tryin' to dance. 
 C'mon c'mon and get together. 
 Let's take a chance, it's now or never. 
 Spread the word over the nation, 
 That we are the new generation. 
 C'mon c'mon and get together, 
 Start livin' your life like it's forever. 
 Don't wanna stop if you're dreamin', 
 Let everyone know what you're feelin'. 
 Questions I can't answer got me going round in circles, 
 Make me feel as if I'm losing self control. 
 It's feeling like a dream to me, I've lost a touch of reality While deep inside I've searched with my soul. 
 Now it's good to keep searching and bettering yourself, 
 But don't push too hard 'cause it's bad for your health. 
 And running round in circles will always get you dizzy, 
 And thinking too much, that will make your head busy. 
 So just sit back and relax, you gotta chill. 
 I promise that all of your dreams will be fulfilled. 
 One day if you keep on looking you'll find, 
 You just gotta go with your heart and your mind."

 A tod@s l@s fans de el mejor grupo 
 de todos, 5 (FIVE). 
 No tuve tiempo suficiente 
 para conocerlos, 
 desde un principio me gustó 
 su música aunque no sabía 
 que les pertenecía. 
 Ahora ya es tarde, 
 no valen las lamentaciones 
 pero, una cosa sí sí: 
 son el más bello recuerdo 
 que perdurará en mi mente 
 hasta mi muerte. 
 Nunca me cansará de escuchar 
 sus armoniosas voces, 
 nunca me cansará de mirarlos, 
 por lo menos en las pocas 
 fotos que conservo de ustedes. 
 Muere un gran concepto musical, 
 no los volveremos a ver juntos jamás 
 más eso no quiere decir 
 que no fueron algo 
 importante en nuestras vidas. 
 Por mi parte, los tendré 
 siempre presentes, 
 llevará la sonrisa que me dieron 
 con sus canciones. 
 Espero que siempre conserven 
 el éxito que lograron con nosotros, 
 que el camino que cada uno elija 
 lo haga el ser más dichoso, 
 que los haga felices. 
 Five: gracias por todo, 
 gracias por ser ustedes 
 y por ser parte de nosotros. 
 Los amaré hasta que me muera 
 y más aún. 
 Y que quede claro que los 
 ""5"" tendrán en mi corazón un 
 ""KINGSIZE"" y que de otros recuerdos 
 ""INVINCIBLE""s serán.

 Beat of my heart 
 I have a question in mind 
 One I don't understand 
 And that's when love makes me crazy 
 It seems the harder I try 
 Find I'm alone again 
 Holding my head in my hands 
 When all I really wanted 
 Someone to hear me calling 
 And set this heart of mine free 
 In every beat 
 Beat of my heart 
 You're everything I need 
 In every breath I breathe 
 Thoughts of you 
 In every beat 
 Strong in my arms I'll hold 
 When all my dreams are shattered 
 Deep in my heart is all that matters 
 Deep in my heart is where I'll keep all my love for you 
 There are times where I feel I finally found someone 
 That I could trust and believe in 
 But when I open my eyes 
 Must be to blind to see that I'm a fool once again 
 I'm tired of broken hearted 
 What a mess I've gotten 
 When all my dreams are shattered 
 Deep in my heart is all that matters 
 Deep in my heart is where ill keep all my love for you 
 Free...

 Slam dunk da funk, put it up 
 (If you got that feeling) 
 Slam dunk da funk, put it up 
 (If you got that feeling) 
 Slam dunk da funk, put it up 
 (If you got that feeling) 
 Slam dunk da funk, put it up (put it up) 
 Clap your hands 
 Stamp your feet 
 Push it in, pull it out to the beat 
 Clap your hands 
 Stamp your feet 
 Push it in, pull it out to the beat 
 Clap your hands 
 Stamp your feet 
 Push it in, pull it out to the beat 
 I ain't sorry for the way I feel 
 I know you think I'm being insincere 
 From the way I'm treating you 
 I never wanted to be so unkind 
 The only one thing on my mind 
 Is just kicking it with you girl 
 Baby it's not the way I feel, you know you must believe me 
 Baby it's not part of the deal (oh no no) 
 Baby when the lights go out 
 Every single word can not express, the love and tenderness 
 I'll show you what it's all about 
 Babe I swear you will succumb to me, so baby come to me 
 When the lights go out 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 Na na na na na na nah... (x4) 
 Ah, move it at the back to the track 
 We got it going on we're the leaders of the pack 
 Now if you feel right, hold it tight 
 See, we wanna carry on 'cause we gonna take it through until the dawn 
 Now everybody's moving, everybody's grooving 
 Getting down with 5 when we come your way 
 So raise up your arms if we drop it on the 1 
 You see we're gonna carry on because the fun has just begun 
 Check us out now! 
 Yo! 7,6,5,4,3,2,1 
 I'm on the microphone, got you hot like the sun 
 So a 1,2,3 now I'm waiting on the 4 
 Kick down the door and turn it up a little more 
 If you got the feelin', jump to the ceiling 
 Ah we're getting down tonight 
 1 if you wanna, 2 if you're gonna, 3 'cause everything's all right 
 If you got the feelin', less of the dreaming 
 Ah, we're getting down tonight 
 It's just round the corner, tell me if you wanna 
 Five will make you feel all right 
 Five bad boys with the power to rock you 
 Five bad boys with the power to rock you 
 Five bad boys with the power to rock you!"
61,Five,pop,Until The End Of Time Is Through,"Now and forever, Until the time is through 
 I can't believe it, I don't know where to start 
 No baby, So many questions deep inside my heart 
 Give me a moment before you go 
 There's something you ought to know 
 Baby now and forever 
 Until the time is through (Until the time is through) 
 I'll be standing here 
 Waiting and never give up my faith in you (Give up my faith in you) 
 Trying to make it clear 
 Without your love, I'd be half a man, Maybe one day, You'll understand 
 Now and forever, Until the time is through 
 I'll be waiting! 
 How can I tell you, so that you can see 
 You know that, Love has a meaning 
 When you are here with me (When you are here with me baby) 
 Give me a moment before you go 
 There's something you ought to know 
 Baby now and forever 
 Until the time is through (Until the time is through) 
 I'll be standing here 
 Waiting and never give up my faith in you (Give up my faith in you) 
 Trying to make it clear 
 Without your love, I'd be half a man, Maybe one day, You'll understand 
 Now and forever, Until the time is through 
 There is no one to comfort me 
 Here in my cold reality 
 I'm searching for words 
 What can I say to make you see 
 Baby now, Until the time is through, I'll be Here 
 Baby now, Until the time is through, I'll be Here 
 Baby now and forever 
 Until the time is through (Until the time is through) 
 I'll be standing here 
 Waiting and never give up my faith in you (Give up my faith in you) 
 Trying to make it clear 
 Without your love, I'd be half a man, Maybe one day, You'll understand 
 Now and forever, Until the time is through"
62,Five,pop,We Will Rock You (new Version),"We're causin' utter devastation 
 When we're stepping to the place 
 And better believe that you can see 
 We're gonna rock and never stop 
 And here we go again 
 Hit you with the flow again 
 Kick it up the second time around 
 We'll bring it on again - shout it out 
 Buddy you're a boy 
 Make a big noise playin' in the street 
 Gonna be a big man some day 
 You got blood on your face, yo' big disgrace 
 Kicking your can all over the place

 We will, we will rock you (ha ha) 
 We will, we will rock you

 How about little something to get you in the mood

 Bring the feedback, and let it drop 
 As long as Five bring the funk 
 Queen bring the (Rock) 
 And it don't stop

 Hard man, shouting in the street 
 Gonna take on the world some day 
 You got blood on your face, big disgrace 
 Waving your banner all over the place
