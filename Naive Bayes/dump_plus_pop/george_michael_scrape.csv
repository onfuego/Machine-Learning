0,George Michael,pop,Faith,"Well, I guess it would be nice 
 If I could touch your body 
 I know not everybody 
 Has got a body like you 
 Oh, but I gotta think twice 
 Before I give my heart away 
 And I know all the games you play 
 Because I play them too 
 Oh, but I need some time off from that emotion 
 Time to pick my heart up off the floor 
 Oh, when that love comes down without devotion 
 Well, it takes a strong man, baby 
 But I'm showin' you the door 
 'Cause I gotta have faith 
 I gotta have faith 
 Because I got to have faith, faith, faith 
 I got to have faith, faith, faith 
 Baby 
 I know you're asking me to stay 
 Sayin' please, please, please don't go away 
 You say I'm giving you the blues 
 Maybe 
 You mean every word you say 
 Can't help but think of yesterday 
 And another who tied me down to loverboy rules 
 Before this river becomes an ocean 
 Before you throw my heart back on the floor 
 Oh baby, I've reconsidered my foolish notion 
 Well, I need someone to hold me 
 But I'll wait for something more 
 Yes, I gotta have faith 
 Mm, I gotta have faith 
 Because I've gotta have faith, faith, faith 
 I gotta have faith, faith, faith 
 I'll just have to wait 
 Because I got to have faith 
 I gotta have faith 
 I've got to, got to, got to have faith 
 Before this river becomes an ocean 
 Before you throw my heart back on the floor 
 (I've just got to have faith) 
 Oh, oh baby, I've reconsidered my foolish notion 
 Well, I need someone to hold me

1,George Michael,pop,Father Figure,"That's all I wanted 
 Something special, someone sacred 
 In your eyes 
 For just one moment 
 To be bold and naked 
 At your side 
 Sometimes I think that you'll never 
 Understand me (understand me) 
 Maybe this time is forever 
 Say it can be, whoa 
 That's all you wanted 
 Something special, someone sacred 
 In your life 
 Just for one moment 
 To be warm and naked 
 At my side 
 Sometimes I think that you'll never 
 Understand me (understand me) 
 But something tells me together 
 We'd be happy, whoa baby 
 I will be your father figure (oh baby) 
 Put your tiny hand in mine (I'd love to) 
 I will be your preacher teacher (be your daddy) 
 Anything you have in mind (it would make me) 
 I will be your father figure (very happy) 
 I have had enough of crime (please let me) 
 I will be the one who loves you 
 Till the end of time 
 That's all I wanted 
 But sometimes love can be mistaken 
 For a crime 
 That's all I wanted 
 Just to see my baby's 
 Blue-eyed shine 
 This time I think that my lover 
 Understands me (understands me) 
 If we have faith in each other 
 Then we can be strong, baby 
 I will be your father figure 
 Put your tiny hand in mine (my baby) 
 I will be your preacher teacher 
 Anything you have in mind 
 I will be your father figure 
 I have had enough of crime 
 I will be the one who loves you 
 Till the end of time 
 If you are the desert, I'll be the sea 
 If you ever hunger, hunger for me 
 Whatever you ask for, that's what I'll be 
 So when you remember the ones who have lied 
 Who said that they cared 
 But then laughed as you cried 
 Beautiful darling 
 Don't think of me 
 Because all I ever wanted 
 It's in your eyes 
 Baby, baby 
 And love can't lie, no 
 (Greet me with the eyes of a child) 
 My love is always telling me so 
 (Heaven is a kiss and a smile) 
 Just hold on, hold on 
 And won't let you go, my baby 
 I will be your father figure 
 Put your tiny hand in mine 
 I will be your preacher teacher 
 Anything you have in mind 
 I will be your father figure 
 And I have had enough of crime 
 So I am gonna love you 
 Till the end of time 
 (I will be your father) I will be your 
 (I will be your preacher) Father 
 (I will be your father) I'll be your daddy, whoa 
 I will be the one who loves you 
 Till the end of time"
2,George Michael,pop,I Want Your Sex,"There's things that you guess

 There's little things you hide

 Sometimes you think you're gonna get it 
 But you don't and that's just the way it goes 
 I swear I won't tease you 
 Won't tell you no lies 
 I don't need no bible

 And here's where mine ends

 I want your love 
 I want your sex 
 I want your... sex 
 It's playing on my mind 
 It's dancing on my soul 
 It's taken so much time 
 So why don't you just let me go 
 I'd really like to try 
 Oh, I'd really love to know 
 When you tell me you're gonna regret it 
 Then I tell you that I love you but you still say NO 
 I swear I won't tease you 
 Won't tell you no lies

 I've waited so long baby 
 Out in the cold 
 I can't take much more girl 
 I'm losing control 
 I want your sex 
 I want your love 
 I want your sex 
 I want your... sex 
 It's natural 
 It's chemical (Let's do it) 
 It's logical 
 Habitual (Can we do it?) 
 It's sensual 
 But most of all... 
 Sex is something that we should do 
 Sex is something for me and you 
 Sex is natural, sex is good 
 Not everybody does it 
 But everybody should 
 Sex is natural, sex is fun 
 Sex is best when it's... one on one 
 One on one 
 I'm not your father 
 I'm not your brother 
 Talk to your sister 
 I am a lover

 What's your definition of dirty baby 
 What do you consider pornography 
 Don't you know I love it till it hurts me baby 
 Don't you think it's time you had sex with me

4,George Michael,pop,One More Try,"I've had enough of danger 
 And people on the streets 
 I'm looking out for angels 
 Just trying to find some peace 
 Now I think it's time 
 That you let me know 
 So if you love me, say you love me 
 But if you don't just let me go 
 'Cause teacher 
 There are things that I don't want to learn 
 And the last one I had made me cry 
 So I don't want to learn to 
 Hold you, touch you 
 Think that you're mine 
 Because there ain't no joy 
 For an uptown boy 
 Whose teacher has told him goodbye 
 Goodbye, goodbye 
 When you were just a stranger 
 And I was at your feet 
 I didn't feel the danger 
 Now I feel the heat 
 That look in your eyes 
 Telling me no 
 So you think that you love me, know that you need me 
 I wrote the song, I know it's wrong 
 Just let me go 
 And teacher 
 There are things that I don't want to learn 
 Oh, the last one I had made me cry 
 So I don't want to learn to 
 Hold you, touch you 
 Think that you're mine 
 Because there ain't no joy 
 For an uptown boy 
 Whose teacher has told him goodbye 
 Goodbye, goodbye 
 So when you say that you need me 
 That you'll never leave me 
 I know you're wrong, you're not that strong 
 Let me go 
 And teacher 
 There are things that I still have to learn 
 But the one thing I have is my pride 
 Oh, so I don't want to learn to 
 Hold you, touch you 
 Think that you're mine 
 Because there ain't no joy 
 For an uptown boy 
 Who just isn't willing to try 
 I'm so cold inside 
 Maybe just one more try"
5,George Michael,pop,Hard Day,"Don't bring me down 
 Don't bring me down 
 Don't bring me down 
 I've never been one for playing games 
 You can move your mouth forever 
 But the words sound just the same 
 Something like, bang bang you're dead 
 Couldn't we just make love instead? 
 Say yes because it's what we do best 
 And I've had such a hard day 
 Take me where their eyes can't find us 
 Without you I may as well just... 
 How much - do I have to say 
 What more - do you have to see 
 What will it take to make you love me? 
 Well you're not the first, you're not the last 
 You're not even the one who loves me the best 
 But all I think about is you 
 So take me where their eyes can't find us

 Shouldn't we just make love instead? 
 Say yes 'cause it's what we do best 
 And I've had such a hard day 
 So don't bring me down 
 Won't you give me a break? 
 Somebody give me a break now! 
 Don't bring me down 
 Don't bring me down 
 Don't bring me down 
 Sweet little boy with oh such a big mouth 
 Harsh words can get you into hot water 
 When people don't understand you baby 
 I'm always here for you 
 And I, and I will never bring you down, down, 
 Down my baby 
 Trust me, I want you to trust me 
 Oh trust me 
 'Cause I won't bring you down

 I won't bring you down 
 Do you trust me? 
 Yeah"
6,George Michael,pop,Hand To Mouth,"Jimmy got nothing but himself a name 
 With a gun that he polished for a rainy day 
 A smile and a quote from a vigilante movie 
 Our boy Jimmy just blew them all away 
 He said it made him crazy 
 Twenty five years living hand to mouth 
 Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth 
 Sweet little baby on a big white doorstep 
 She needs her mother but her mother is dead 
 Just another hooker that the lucky can forget 
 Just another hooker It happens everyday 
 She loved her little baby 
 But she couldn't bear to see her living hand to mouth 
 Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth 
 I believe in the gods of America 
 I believe in the land of the free 
 But no one told me (No one told me) 
 That the gods believe in nothing 
 So with empty hands I pray and from day to hopeless day 
 They still don't see me (See me) 
 Everybody talks about the new generation 
 Jump on the wagon or they'll leave you behind 
 But no one gave a thought to the rest of the nation 
 Like to help you buddy, but I haven't got the time 
 Somebody shouted save me 
 But everybody started living hand to mouth 
 Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth 
 There's a big white lady on a big white doorstep 
 She asked her daddy and her daddy said yes 
 Has to give a little for the dollars that we get 
 Has to give a little - They say it's for the best 
 Somebody shouted Maybe 
 But they kept on living from hand to mouth 
 Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth 
 So she ran to the arms of America 
 And she kissed the powers that be 
 And someone told me (Someone told me) 
 That the gods believe in nothing so with empty hands I pray 
 And I tell myself One day 
 They just might see me..."

 You listened to people 
 Who scared you to death, and from my heart 
 Strange that you were strong enough 
 To even make a start 
 But you'll never find peace of mind 
 Till you listen to your heart 
 People, you can never change the way they feel 
 Better let them do just what they will 
 For they will, If you let them 
 Steal your heart from you 
 People, Will always make a lover feel a fool 
 But you knew I loved you 
 We could have shown them all 
 We should have seen love through 
 Fooled me with the tears in your eyes 
 Covered me with kisses and lies 
 So good-bye, but please don't take my heart 
 You are far, I'm never gonna be your star 
 I'll pick up the pieces and mend my heart 
 Maybe I'll be strong enough, I don't know where to start 
 But I'll never find peace of mind, while I listen to my heart 
 People, you can never change the way they feel 
 Better let them do just what they will 
 For they will, If you let them, steal your heart 
 And people, will always make a lover feel a fool 
 But you knew I loved you 
 We could have shown them all 
 We should have seen love through 
 But remember this, every other kiss 
 That you ever give, long as we both live 
 When you need the hand of another man 
 One you really can surrender with 
 I will wait for you, like I always do 
 There's something there, that can't compare 
 With any other 
 You are far 
 When I could have been your star 
 You listened to people 
 Who scared you to death, and from my heart 
 Strange that I was wrong enough 
 To think you'd love me too 
 I guess you were kissing a fool 
 You must have been kissing a fool"

 To get those big bad car keys 
 Out of your hand 
 You know 
 That I remain a gentle man 
 But even so 
 There's only so much

 I can make you happy 
 If only for a while 
 Little baby I can give you all the loving that your heart desires 
 If you ain't got time for me I'll find another Fantasy

 Could the price of hate 
 What am I guilty of 
 Why do you make me wait 
 So long I don't know your intentions 
 Look to the sky's above 
 I am in the hands of fate 
 Push till it gets to shove 
 I have got to know for heavens sake 
 Is this love or invention 
 Baby can't you see I'll find another Fantasy 
 You hang around with people who are sure to make you cry 
 I can make you happy if only for a while 
 Little baby oh, oh little baby 
 I can give you all the lovin' that your heart desires 
 If you ain't got time for me I'll find another Fantasy 
 You take someone's heart 
 And you kick it around 
 Keep on picking it up 
 So you can watch it come down 
 I don't know what I am suppose to do 
 Why I wait for you to make up your mind 
 Would you please be so kind 
 When you know what to do I'll be in the next room

 Will open up our merging hearts 
 And feed our empty souls 
 I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever 
 I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever 
 Without despair, we will share 
 And the joys of caring will not be erased 
 What has been, must never end 
 The joys of caring will not be replaced 
 When the seeds of love have planted firm 
 They won't be hard to find 
 And the songs of love I sing to you 
 Will echo in my mind 
 Hey! 
 I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever. I said. 
 I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever. 
 I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever. Yeah!

14,George Michael,pop,Praying For Time,"Woah, yeah 
 Do do do, oh 
 These are the days of the open hand 
 They will not be the last 
 Look around now 
 These are the days of the beggars and the choosers 
 This is the year of the hungry man 
 Whose place is in the past 
 Hand in hand 
 With ignorance and legitimate excuses 
 The rich declare themselves poor 
 And most of us are not sure 
 If we have too much 
 But we'll take our chances 
 'Cause God's stopped keeping score 
 I guess somewhere along the way 
 He must have let us all out to play 
 Turned his back and all God's children 
 Crept out the back door 
 And it's hard to love 
 There's so much to hate 
 Hanging on to hope 
 When there is no hope to speak of 
 And the wounded skies above 
 Say it's much, much too late 
 Well maybe we should all be praying for time 
 Do, do, do, oh 
 Mmm, woah yeah 
 These are the days of the empty hand 
 Oh you hold on to what you can 
 And charity 
 Is a coat you wear twice a year 
 This is the year of the guilty man 
 Your television takes a stand 
 And you find 
 That what was over there is over here 
 So you scream from behind your door 
 Say what's mine is mine and not yours 
 I may have too much 
 But I'll take my chances 
 'Cause God's stopped keeping score 
 And you cling to the things they sold you 
 Did you cover your eyes when they told you 
 That He can't come back 
 'Cause He has no children to come back for 
 It's hard to love 
 There's so much to hate 
 Hanging on to hope 
 When there is no hope to speak of 
 And the wounded skies above 
 Say it's much too late 
 So maybe we should all be praying for time 
 Woah yeah"
15,George Michael,pop,Freedom 90,"I won't let you down 
 I will not give you up 
 Gotta have some faith in the sound 
 It's the one good thing that I've got 
 I won't let you down 
 So please don't give me up 
 Because I would really, really love to stick around 
 Heaven knows I was just a young boy 
 Didn't know what I wanted to be 
 I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy 
 And I guess it was enough for me 
 To win the race? A prettier face 
 Brand new clothes and a big fat place 
 On your rock and roll TV 
 But today the way I play the game is not the same 
 No way 
 Think I'm gonna get me some happy 
 I think there's something you should know 
 I think it's time I told you so 
 There's something deep inside of me 
 There's someone else I've got to be 
 Take back your picture in a frame 
 Take back your singing in the rain 
 I just hope you understand 
 Sometimes the clothes do not make the man 
 All we have to do now 
 Is take these lies and make them true somehow 
 All we have to see 
 Is that I don't belong to you 
 And you don't belong to me 
 Freedom 
 You've gotta give for what you take 
 Freedom 
 You've gotta give for what you take 
 Heaven knows we sure had some fun boy 
 What a kick just a buddy and me 
 We had every big shot good-time band on the run boy 
 We were living in a fantasy 
 We won the race 
 Got out of the place 
 I went back home got a brand new face 
 For the boys on MTV 
 But today the way I play the game has got to change 
 Oh yeah 
 Now I'm gonna get myself happy 
 I think there's something you should know 
 I think it's time I stopped the show 
 There's something deep inside of me 
 There's someone I forgot to be 
 Take back your picture in a frame 
 Don't think that I'll be back again 
 I just hope you understand 
 Sometimes the clothes do not make the man 
 All we have to do now 
 Is take these lies and make them true somehow 
 All we have to see 
 Is that I don't belong to you 
 And you don't belong to me 
 Freedom 
 You've gotta give for what you take 
 Freedom 
 You've gotta give for what you take 
 Well it looks like the road to heaven 
 But it feels like the road to hell 
 When I knew which side my bread was buttered 
 I took the knife as well 
 Posing for another picture 
 Everybody's got to sell 
 But when you shake your ass 
 They notice fast 
 And some mistakes were built to last 
 That's what you get 
 I say that's what you get 
 That's what you get for changing your mind 
 And after all this time 
 I just hope you understand 
 Sometimes the clothes 
 Do not make the man 
 I'll hold on to my freedom 
 May not be what you want from me 
 Just the way it's got to be 
 Lose the face now 
 I've got to live"
16,George Michael,pop,They Won't Go When I Go,"No more lying friends 
 Wanting tragic ends 
 Though they do pretend 
 They won't go when I go 
 All those bleeding hearts 
 With sorrows to impart 
 Were right here from the start 
 And they won't go when I go 
 And I'll go where I've longed 
 To go so long 
 Away from tears 
 Gone from painful cries 
 Away from saddened eyes 
 Along with them I'll bide 
 Because they won't go when I go 
 Big men feeling small 
 Weak ones standing tall 
 I will watch them fall 
 They won't go when I go 
 And I'll go where I've long 
 To go so long 
 Away from tears 
 Unclean minds mislead the pure 
 The innocent will leave for sure 
 For them there is a resting place 
 People sinning just for fun 
 They will never see the sun 
 For they can never show their faces 
 There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner 
 Who will take more then he will give 
 He ain't hardly gonna give 
 The greed of man will be 
 Far away from me 
 And my soul will be free 
 They won't go when I go 
 Since my soul conceived 
 All that I believe 
 The kingdom I will see 
 'Cause they won't go when I go 
 When I go 
 Where I'll go 
 No one can keep me 
 From my destiny"
17,George Michael,pop,Something To Save,"If you've got something to say 
 Why don't you say it 
 If you've got something to give 
 Why don't you give it to me 
 Day after day I have to say it 
 We're moving further from heaven 
 And closer to the deep blue sea 
 'Cause I have no secrets from you 
 And I have nothing left to hide 
 And I'm open to all your questions 
 Why can't you reach inside 
 Like I have 
 Like I have for you 
 And all these games that you play 
 Don't tell me how a man should be 
 Some would say if you knew 
 You wouldn't be here with me 
 I love you 
 I still love you 
 But I guess it's time to let you be 
 'Cause I have no secrets from you 
 And I have nothing left to hide 
 And I'm so tired of all these questions 
 'Cause maybe you just changed your mind 
 Like I have 
 Like I have 
 Like I have 
 Like I have 
 When I was at your doorstep 
 You told me to look around 
 Said come in 
 You and your heart sit down 
 But you better watch your step 
 'Cause you're not far from the ground 
 And one fine day this all falls down 
 Like I have 
 Like I have 
 If you've got something to say 
 Why don't you say it 
 If you've got something to give 
 Why don't you give it to me 
 Day after day I have to say it 
 If we've got something to save 
 Why don't we save it"
18,George Michael,pop,Cowboys And Angels,"When your heart's in someone else's hands 
 Monkey see and monkey do 
 Their wish is your command 
 You're not to blame 
 Everyone's the same 
 All you do is love and love is all you do 
 I should know by now the way I fought for you 
 You're not to blame 
 Everyone's the same 
 I know you think that you're safe 
 Mister 
 Harmless deception that keeps love at bay 
 It's the ones who resist that we most want to kiss 
 Wouldn't you say? 
 Cowboys and angels 
 They all have the time for you 
 Why should I imagine 
 That I'd be a find for you 
 Why should I imagine 
 That I'd have something to say 
 But that scar on your face 
 That beautiful face of yours 
 In your heart there's a trace 
 Of someone before 
 When your heart's in someone else's plans 
 Things you say and things you do 
 They don't understand 
 It's such a shame 
 Always ends the same 
 You can call it love but I don't think it's true 
 You should know by now 
 I'm not the boy for you 
 You're not to blame 
 Always ends the same 
 I know you think that you're safe 
 Sister 
 Harmless affection that keeps things this way 
 It's the ones who persist for the sake of a kiss 
 Who will pay 
 Cowboys and angels 
 They all take a shine to you 
 Why should I imagine 
 That I was designed for you 
 Why should I believe 
 That you would stay 
 But that scar on your face 
 That beautiful face of yours 
 Don't you think that I know 
 They hurt you before 
 Take this man to your bed 
 Maybe his hands 
 Will help you forget 
 Please be stronger than your past 
 The future may still give you a chance"
19,George Michael,pop,Waiting For That Day,"Now every day I see you in some other face 
 They crack a smile, talk a while 
 Try to take your place 
 My memory serves me far too well 
 I just sit here on this mountain thinking to myself 
 You're a fool boy 
 Why don't you go down 
 Find somebody 
 Find somebody else 
 My memory serves me far too well 
 It's not as though we just broke up 
 It's not as though it was yesterday 
 But something I just can't explain 
 Something in me needs this pain 
 I know I'll never see your face again 
 C'mon now 
 I've got to be strong now 
 Now everybody's talking about this new decade 
 Like you say the magic number 
 Then just say goodbye to 
 The stupid mistakes you made 
 Oh my memory serves me far too well 
 Don't you know that 
 The years will come and go 
 Some of us will change our lives 
 Some of us still have nothing to show 
 Nothing baby 
 But memories 
 And if these wounds 
 They are self inflicted 
 I don't really know 
 How my poor heart could have protected me 
 But if I have to carry this pain 
 If you will not share the blame 
 I deserve to see your face again 
 C'mon now 
 You don't have to be so strong now 
 Come back 
 Come back to me darling 
 I will make it worth your while 
 Come back to your baby 
 I miss your kiss 
 I miss your smile 
 Seems to me the peace I search to find 
 Ain't gonna be mine until you say you will 
 Don't you keep me waiting for that day 
 I know 
 You hear these words that I say 
 You can't always get what you want..."
20,George Michael,pop,Mother's Pride,"Oh she knows 
 She takes his hand 
 And prays the child will understand 
 At the door they watch the men go by 
 In the clothes that daddy wore 
 Mothers pride 
 Baby Boy 
 His father's eyes 
 He's a soldier waiting for war 
 Time will come 
 He'll hold a gun 
 His father's son 
 And as he grows 
 He hears the band 
 Takes the step from boy to man 
 And at the shore she waves her son goodbye 
 Like the man she did before 
 Mothers pride 
 Just a boy 
 His country's eyes 
 He's a soldier waving at the shore 
 And in her heart the time has come 
 To lose a son 
 And all the husbands, all the sons, all the lovers gone 
 They make no difference 
 No difference in the end 
 Still hear the woman say your daddy died a hero 
 In the name of God and man 
 Mothers pride 
 Crazy boy 
 His lifeless eyes 
 He's a soldier now forevermore 
 He'll hold a gun till kingdom come"
21,George Michael,pop,Heal The Pain,"Let me tell you a secret 
 Put it in your heart and keep it 
 Something that I want you to know 
 Do something for me 
 Listen to my simple story 
 And maybe we'll have someting to show 
 You tell me you're cold on the inside 
 How can the outside world 
 Be a place that your heart can embrace 
 Be good to yourself 
 Because nobody else 
 Has the power to make you happy 
 How can I help you 
 Please let me try to 
 I can heal the pain 
 That you're feeling inside 
 Whenever you want me 
 You know that I will be 
 Waiting for the day 
 That you say you'll be mine 
 He must have really hurt you 
 To make you say the things that you do 
 He must have really hurt you 
 To make those pretty eyes look so blue 
 He must have known 
 That he could 
 That you'd never leave him 
 Now you can't see my love is good 
 And that I'm not him 
 How can I help you 
 Please let me try to 
 I can heal the pain 
 That you're feeling inside 
 Whenever you want me 
 You know that I will be 
 Waiting for the day 
 That you say you'll be mine 
 Who needs a lover 
 That can't be a friend 
 Something tells me I'm the one you've been looking for 
 If you ever should see him again 
 Won't you tell him you've found someone who gives you more 
 Someone who will protect you 
 Love and respect you 
 All those things 
 That he never could bring to you 
 Like I do 
 Or rather I would 
 Won't you show me your heart 
 Like you should 
 Won't you let me in 
 Let this love begin 
 Won't you show me your heart now 
 I'll be good to you 
 I can make this thing true 
 And get to your heart somehow"
22,George Michael,pop,Soul Free,"Higher, higher 
 Won't you come with me 
 Baby gonna get my soul free 
 Now you and me 
 I guess we see things differently 
 We're night and day 
 A bad connection some would say 
 And I don't want nothing to change 
 I don't want nothing to change 
 Because 
 When you touch me baby 
 I don't have no choice 
 Oh that sweet temptation 
 In your voice... 
 Higher, higher 
 Won't you come with me 
 Baby gonna get my soul free 
 Now seems to me 
 Some things have just got to be 
 The games we play 
 Break up make-up day by day 
 And I don't want nothing to change 
 Said I don't want nothing to change 
 Because 
 When you touch me baby 
 I don't have no choice 
 Oh that sweet temptation 
 In your voice

 Won't you come with me 
 Baby gonna get my soul free"
23,George Michael,pop,Waiting (Reprise),"Well, there ain't no point in moving on 
 Until you've got somewhere to go 
 And the road that I have walked upon 
 Well it filled my pockets 
 And emptied out my soul 
 All those insecurities 
 That have held me down for so long 
 I can't say that I've found a cure for these 
 But at least I know them 
 So they're not so strong 
 You look for your dreams in Heaven 
 But what the hell are you supposed to do 
 When they come true? 
 Well there's one year of my life in these songs 
 And some of them are about you 
 Now I know there is no way I can write those wrongs 
 Believe me 
 I would not lie you've hurt my pride 
 And I guess there's a road without you 
 But you once said 
 There's a way back for every man 
 So here I am 
 Don't people change? 
 Here I am 
 Is it too late to try again? 
 Here I am"

 And I was your man 
 There would be no other woman 
 You'd be weak as a lamb 
 If you had the strength to walk out that door 
 My love would overrule my sense I would call you back for more 
 If you were my woman 
 If you were my woman 
 And I was your man, Yeah! 
 He tears you down darlin' 
 Says your nothing at all 
 But I'll be there for darlin' 
 When he lets you fall 
 You're like a diamond 
 But he treats you like glass 
 Yet you beg him to love you 
 With me you don't ask 
 If you were my woman 
 If you were my woman 
 Here's what I'd do, Oh 
 I'd never, no, no, no stop lovin' you 
 Whoa! Yeah! 
 My darlin' 
 Life is so crazy 
 And love is so unkind 
 Because he came first, darlin' 
 Will he hang on your mind 
 You're a part of me 
 And you don't even know it 
 I'm what you need 
 But I'm too afraid to show it 
 If you were my woman 
 Here's what I'd do, Oh 
 I'd never, no, no, no 
 Whoa! Oh!

26,George Michael,pop,Papa Was A Rollin' Stone,"It was the third of September 
 That day I'll always remember, yes I will 
 'Cause that was the day that my daddy died 
 Never had a chance to see him, no 
 Never heard nothing but bad things about him 
 Mama, I'm depending on you to tell me the truth 
 Mama just hung her head and said 
 ""Papa was a rollin' stone 
 Wherever he laid his hat was his home 
 And when he died 
 All he left us was alone"" 
 Hey, mama, is it true what they say 
 That papa never worked aday in his life 
 Some bad talk going around sayin' 
 Papa had three outside children 
 And another wife 
 That ain't right 
 Heard some talk about papa and his storefront 
 Preachin' 
 Talkin' about saving souls and all the time 
 Leachin' 
 And dealing in dirt 
 Stealin' in the name of the Lord 
 But mama she just said 
 ""Papa was a rollin' stone 
 Wherever he laid his hat was his home 
 And when he died 
 All he left us was alone"" 
 Say I heard my papa was a jack of all trades 
 Is that what papa sent to an early grave? 
 Folks say papa would beg, borrow or steal just 
 To pay his bills 
 Hey, mama, folks say papa was never much in thinkin' 
 Spent most of his time chasin' women and drinkin' 
 But mother, I'm depending on you 
 To tell me the truth 
 But my mama she just said 
 ""Papa was a rollin' stone 
 Wherever he laid his hat was his home 
 And when he died 
 All he left us was alone""

 Can't you hear me? 
 I am calling you 
 I am calling you 
 Can't you hear me? 
 I am calling you 
 A desert road from Vegas to nowhere 
 Someplace better than where you've been 
 A coffee machine that needs some fixin' 
 In a little cafe just around the bend 
 A hot dry wind blows right through me 
 The baby's crying so I can't sleep 
 But we both know the change is coming 
 Come in closer, sweet release 
 I am calling you 
 Can't you hear me? 
 I am calling you 
 Desert road from Vegas to nowhere"
28,George Michael,pop,Jesus To A Child,"Kindness in your eyes 
 I guess you heard me cry 
 You smiled at me like Jesus to a child 
 I'm blessed I know 
 Heaven sent and heaven stole 
 You smiled at me like Jesus to a child 
 And what have I learned from all this pain 
 I thought I never feel the same about anyone or anything again 
 But now I know 
 When you find a love 
 When you know that it exists 
 Then the lover that you miss 
 Will come to you on those cold, cold nights 
 When you've been loved 
 When you know it holds such bliss 
 Then the lover that you kissed 
 Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight 
 Sadness in my eyes 
 No one guessed and no one tried 
 You smiled at me like Jesus to a child 
 Loveless and cold 
 With your last breath you saved my soul 
 You smiled at me like Jesus to a child 
 And what have I learned from all these tears 
 I've waited for you all those years 
 Then just when it began he took your love away 
 But I still say 
 When you find a love 
 When you know that it exists 
 Then the lover that you miss 
 Will come to you on those cold, cold nights 
 When you've been loved 
 When you know it holds such bliss 
 Then the lover that you kissed 
 Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight 
 So the words you could not say 
 I'll sing them for you 
 And the love we would have made 
 I'll make it for two 
 For every single memory 
 Has become a part of me 
 You will always be my love 
 Well I've been loved so I know just what love is 
 And the lover that I kissed is always by my side 
 Oh the lover I still miss... was Jesus to a child"

 All that bullshit conversation 
 Baby can't you read the signs? 
 I won't bore you with the details, baby 
 I don't even wanna waste your time 
 Let's just say that maybe 
 You could help to ease my mind 
 Baby, I ain't Mr. Right 
 But if you're looking for fast love 
 If that's love in your eyes, it's more than enough 
 Had some bad love 
 Some fast love, is all that I've got on my mind 
 Ooh, yeah yeah (ooh ooh, baby baby) 
 What's there to think about baby? 
 (Ooh ooh, baby baby) 
 Hey baby, oh yeah (ooh ooh, baby baby) 
 Looking for some affirmation, made my way into the sun 
 My friends got their ladies, they're all having babies 
 But I just want to have some fun 
 I won't bore you with the detail baby 
 You gotta get there in your own sweet time 
 Let's just say that maybe, you could help 
 To ease my mind, baby, I ain't Mr. Right 
 But if you're looking for fast love 
 If that's love in your eyes, it's more than enough 
 Had some bad love 
 Some fast love, is all that I've got on my mind 
 So close I can taste it now baby, so close 
 In the absence of security, I made my way into the night 
 Stupid Cupid keeps on calling me 
 And I see lovin' in his eyes 
 I miss my baby, oh yeah, I miss my baby tonight 
 So why don't we make a little room 
 In my BMW, babe, searchin' for some peace of mind 
 Hey, I'll help you find it 
 I do believe that we are practicing the same religion

 Well, you're out of time, I'm letting go, you'll be fine

 You were there, I thought I needed you

 Or maybe you won't 
 You're out of time, I'm letting go 
 I'm not the man that you want 
 I never should have looked back in your direction 
 I know that, just the same old fights again, baby 
 These are wasted days without affection 
 I'm not that foolish anymore 
 So you're out of time, I'm letting go, you'll be fine

31,George Michael,pop,Spinning The Wheel,"Five o'clock in the morning you ain't home 
 I can't help thinking that's strange 
 Baby I just want you to know I won't go through this again 
 Yes, those clouds are closing in 
 And I will not accept this as a part of my life 
 I will not live in fear of what may be 
 And the lessons that I learned 
 I would rather be alone than watch you spinning that wheel for me 
 You've got a thing about danger 
 Ain't you getting what you want from me 
 You've got a thing about strangers 
 Baby that's what we used to be 
 You've got a thing about danger baby 
 I guess the hungry just can't see 
 One of these days you gonna bring some home to me 
 Six o'clock in the morning you ain't home 
 I can't help thinking it's strange 
 It seems that everybody takes their chances these days 
 Oh yeah, we're standing in the rain 
 And I will not accept this as a part of my life 
 I will not live in fear of what may be 
 And the lessons that I learned 
 I would rather be alone than watch you spinning that wheel for me 
 You've got a thing about danger 
 Ain't you getting what you want from me 
 You've got a thing about strangers 
 Baby that's what we used to be 
 You've got a thing about danger baby

 How many reasons call 
 It doesn't really matter at all 
 It doesn't matter that I failed to 
 Break down your father's wall 
 It doesn't matter at all 
 Why tell me you don't understand when you do 
 I thought I had something to say 
 But it really doesn't matter at all... 
 I changed my name 
 To be rid of the things that I want from you 
 It's strange 
 But a name is a name and the truth is the truth 
 Oh, there is always 
 Always someone to remind me 
 So I learn to live with shame 
 Tell myself I feel no pain 
 But I do 
 And if I have to tell you 
 Then it really doesn't matter at all... 
 And it's no good looking back 
 Because time's a thief and I believe that 
 I'm too old for that 
 We're just saying the things that we've said 
 Forever 
 It doesn't really matter that I loved you 
 How many seasons fall 
 It's too bad 
 It really doesn't matter at all"
33,George Michael,pop,The Strangest Thing,"Take my life 
 Time has been twisting the knife 
 I don't recognise 
 People I care for 
 Take my dreams 
 Childish and weak at the seams 
 Please don't analyse 
 Please just be there for me 
 The things that I know 
 Nobody told me 
 The seeds that are sown 
 They still control me 
 There's a liar in my head 
 There's a thief upon my bed 
 And the strangest thing 
 Is I cannot seem to get my eyes open 
 Take my hand 
 Lead me to some peaceful land 
 That I cannot find 
 Inside my head 
 Wake me with love 
 It's all I need 
 But in all this time 
 Still no one said 
 If I had not asked 
 Would you have told me 
 If you call this love 
 Why don't you hold me? 
 There's a liar in my head 
 There's a thief upon my bed 
 And the strangest thing 
 Is I cannot seem to get my eyes open 
 Give me something I can hold 
 Give me something to believe in 
 I am frightened for my soul 
 Please, please 
 Make love to me, send love through me 
 Heal me with your crime 
 The only one who ever knew me 
 We've wasted so much time 
 So much time"
34,George Michael,pop,To Be Forgiven,"I'm going down 
 Won't you help me 
 Save me from myself 
 I hear the sound of a memory 
 Maybe time will tell 
 Suddenly my life is like a river 
 Taking me places I don't want to go 
 But like all good men who swim too well 
 It takes all that I have just to cry for help 
 Then that voice in my head 
 Tells me no 
 I'm going down 
 Won't you help me 
 Save me from myself 
 I look around for a fantasy 
 Maybe 
 Who can tell? 
 Let me live my life beside the river 
 Take me to places where a child can grow 
 And then 
 Maybe the boy inside will forsake me 
 Maybe 
 The child in me 
 Will just let me go 
 I'm going down 
 The cold, cold water is rushing in 
 I'm going down 
 And I would beg to be forgiven 
 If I knew my sin"
35,George Michael,pop,Move On,"I've been in and out of favour with Lady Luck 
 I gotta tell ya 
 I've seen things I've never wanted to see 
 I've got to get back on my feet 
 I feel like I've been sleeping 
 Sweet, sweet time 
 Has been a real good friend of mine 
 Waiting for that change of season 
 Oh the winter's been so long 
 Searching for that rhyme or reason 
 You've just got to 
 Move on 
 Hold it together, move on 
 Life's so short, move on 
 Only time can set you free 
 You put your fears behind you 
 Better get yourself where you wanna be 
 I think of all the days and night that I spent crying 
 And I move on 
 I've been in and out of favour with love 
 Because I gotta tell ya 
 I've been things I never wanted to be 
 And then some angel called me up 
 Told me I was sleeping 
 Don't waste time 
 'Cause even angels say goodbye 
 Waiting for that change of season 
 Oh the winter's been so long 
 Searching for that rhyme or reason 
 You've just got to 
 Move on 
 Hold it together, move on 
 Life's so short, move on 
 Only time can set you free 
 You put your tears behind you 
 Better get yourself where you wanna be 
 I think of all the days and night that I spent crying 
 Endlessly 
 And oh, there goes another season 
 Getting hard to find a decent song to play 
 But oh, I guess I got my reasons 
 Everybody thinks I'm doing AOK 
 They ought to know by now 
 Move on 
 Hold it together, move on 
 Life's so short, move on 
 Only time can set you free 
 You put your tears behind you 
 Better get yourself where you wanna be 
 I think of all the days and night that I spent crying 
 Until my angel set me free 
 I'm gonna be lucky in love someday"

 Counting the cost of your desire to be seen 
 I do not count myself among you 
 I may be living in a dream 
 It's just there seems so many of you 
 Can't help but hope there's a difference between... 
 You and me 
 (You're a star) 
 I'm talking to you 
 And you should go far (you're a star) 
 I said, maybe your mama gave you up boy 
 (It's the same old same old) 
 Maybe your daddy didn't love you enough, girl 
 (How much is enough) 
 Star people 
 Never forget you're secret's safe with me, just 
 Look at all the wonderful people 
 Trying to forget they had to pay for what you see 
 It's a dream 
 With a nightmare stuck in the middle 
 But listen brother, where would you be 
 Without all of that attention 
 You'd die, I'd die, we'd die 
 Wouldn't we? 
 Well wouldn't we 
 Big, big, star! 
 Should go far! 
 I said, maybe your mama gave you up boy 
 (It's the same old same old) 
 Maybe your daddy didn't love you enough, girl 
 (How much is enough) 
 Talk about your mother, talk about your father 
 Talk about the people who have made you what you are 
 Talk about your teacher, the bully boy who beat you 
 Talk about the people who have paid for that new sports car 
 Did you get off on a bad foot, baby 
 Do you have a little tale to tell 
 Is that why you're a star? 
 Is that what makes a star? 
 Now, nothing comes from nothing, baby 
 That fame and fortune's heaven sent 
 And who gives a f*** about your problems, darling 
 When you can pay the rent 
 How much is enough?"
37,George Michael,pop,You Have Been Loved,"She takes the back road and the lane 
 Past the school that has not changed 
 In all this time 
 She thinks of when the boy was young 
 All the battles she had won 
 Just to give him life 
 That man 
 She loved that man 
 For all his life 
 But now we meet to take him flowers 
 And only God knows why 
 For what's the use in pressing palms 
 When children fade in mother's arms 
 It's a cruel world 
 We've so much to lose 
 And what we have to learn we rarely choose 
 So if it's God who took her son 
 He cannot be the one living in her mind 
 Take care my love, she said 
 Don't think that God is dead 
 Take care my love, she said 
 You have been loved 
 If I was weak, forgive me 
 But I was terrified 
 You brushed my eyes with angels wings, full of love 
 The kind that makes devils cry 
 So these days 
 My life has changed 
 And I'll be fine 
 But she just sits and counts the hours 
 Searching for her crime 
 So what's the use of pressing palms 
 If you won't keep such love from harm 
 It's a cruel world 
 You've so much to prove 
 And heaven helps the ones who wait for you 
 Well I've no daughters, I've no sons 
 Guess I'm the only one 
 Living in my life 
 Take care my love, he said 
 Don't think that God is dead 
 Take care my love, he said 
 You have been loved..."

 I feel so unsure 
 As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor 
 As the music dies 
 Something in your eyes 
 Calls to mind a silver screen and all its sad goodbyes 
 I'm never gonna dance again 
 Guilty feet have got no rhythm 
 Though it's easy to pretend 
 I know you're not a fool 
 I should have known better than to cheat a friend 
 And waste a chance that I'd been given

 Tonight the music seems so loud 
 I wish that we could lose this crowd 
 Maybe it's better this way

 We could have been so good together 
 We could have lived this dance forever

 I would have made some other plans 
 If I'd only seen it sooner 
 But what a way with your hands you had 
 I wanted that moment with you 
 I know that it's wrong 
 But if you need me, I'm here, turns me on

 I can't help thinking it's a miracle 
 I can't help thinking it's a miracle 
 I can't help thinking it's a miracle 
 I can't help thinking it's a miracle you're here

 I'd say love would keep us from pain 
 Had I been there, had I been there 
 I would promise you all of my life 
 But to lose you would cut like a knife 
 So I don't dare, no I don't dare 
 'Cause I've never come close in all of these years 
 You are the only one to stop my tears 
 And I'm so scared, I'm so scared 
 Take me back in time maybe I can forget 
 Turn a different corner and we never would have met 
 Would you care 
 I don't understand it, for you it's a breeze 
 Little by little you've brought me to my knees 
 Don't you care 
 No I've never come close in all of these years 
 You are the only one to stop my tears 
 I'm so scared of this love 
 And if all that there is, is this fear of being used 
 I should go back to being lonely and confused 
 If I could, I would, I swear 
 Oh, I swear"

 Until the day that is the day that I'm no more

 Her acceptance is the way we pay 
 Did you know that life has given love a guarantee 
 To last through forever and another day? 
 As today I know I'm living 
 But tomorrow could make me the past 
 But that I mustn't fear, 'cause you're here 
 As today I know I'm living but tomorrow 
 Could make me the past but that I mustn't fear 
 For I'll know deep in my mind 
 The love of me I've left behind 
 And I'll be loving you always 
 Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Loving you) 
 Until the ocean covers every mountain high (I'll be loving you) 
 Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Loving you) 
 Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream (Now, ain't that loving you?) 
 Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Always) 
 Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (I'll be loving you forever) 
 Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4 (Always)

 Brother can you spare a dime? 
 Once in khaki suits

 Full of that yankee doodle de dum 
 Half a million boots went slogging through hell 
 I was the kid with the drum 
 Say don't you remember, they called me Al 
 It was Al all the time 
 Say don't you remember, I'm your pal!

 You don't have to put on the red light 
 Those days are over 
 You don't have to sell your body to the night

 You don't have to wear that dress tonight 
 Walk the streets for money 
 You don't care if it's wrong or if it's right 
 Roxanne 
 You don't have to put on the red light 
 I loved you since I knew you 
 I wouldn't talk down to you 
 I have to tell you just how I feel 
 I won't share you with another boy 
 I know my mind is made up 
 So put away your make up 
 Told you once I won't tell you again 
 It's a bad way

 That sparkle in your eyes has gone 
 Your smile is just a careless yawn 
 You're breaking my heart, you've changed 
 You've changed 
 Your kisses are now so blase 
 You're bored with me in every way 
 I can't understand you've changed 
 You've forgotten the word I love you 
 Each memory that we've shared 
 You ignore every star above you 
 I can't realise you ever cared 
 You've changed 
 You're not the anges I once knew 
 No need to tell me that we're through 
 It's all over now, you've changed 
 You've forgotten the word I love you

 My baby just cares for me 
 My baby don't care for cars and races 
 My baby don't care for high tone places 
 Elizabeth taylor is not his style 
 And even ricky martin's smile 
 Is something he can't see 
 My baby don't care who knows it 
 My baby just cares for me 
 I wonder what's wrong with baby 
 My baby just cares for 
 He just says his prayers for 
 My baby just cares

55,George Michael,pop,Miss Sarajevo,"Is there a time for keeping a distance 
 A time to turn your eyes away 
 Is there a time for keeping your head down 
 For getting on with your day 
 Is there a time for kohl and lipstick 
 A time for cutting hair 
 Is there a time for high street shopping 
 To find the right dress to wear 
 Here she comes 
 Heads turn around 
 Here she comes 
 To take her crown 
 Is there a time to walk for cover 
 A time for kiss and tell 
 Is there a time for different colors 
 Different names you find it hard to spell 
 Is there a time for first communion 
 A time for east 17 
 Is there a time to turn the mecca 
 Is there a time to be a beauty queen 
 Here she comes 
 Beauty plays the crown 
 Here she comes 
 Surreal in her crown 
 Dici che il fiume 
 Trova la via al mare 
 E come il fiume 
 Giungerai a me 
 Oltre I confini 
 E le terre assetate 
 Dici che come fiume 
 Come fiume 
 Lamore giunger 
 Lamore 
 E non so pi pregare 
 E nellamore non so pi sperare 
 E quellamore non so pi aspettare

 A time for christmas trees 
 Is there a time for laying tables 
 When the night is set to freeze"
56,George Michael,pop,The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,"The first time ever I saw your face 
 I thought the sun rose in your eyes 
 And the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave 
 To the dark and endless skies, my love 
 To the dark and empty skies 
 The first time ever I kissed your mouth 
 I felt the earth move in my hands 
 Like the trembling heart of a captive bird 
 That was there at my command, my love 
 That was there at my command 
 The first time I ever lay with you 
 And felt you heart so close to mine 
 And I knew our joy would fill the world 
 And would last till the and of time, my love 
 It would last till the end of time 
 The first time ever I saw your face 
 Your face, your face"

 You're the one who made my dreams come true 
 A few kisses ago 
 I remember you 
 You're the one who said I love you too 
 Didn't you know 
 I remember too 
 A distant bell 
 And stars that fell 
 Like rain out of the blue 
 When my life is through 
 And the angels ask me to recall 
 The thrill of them all 
 Then I will tell them I remember you 
 I remember you 
 You're the one who made my dreams come true 
 A few kisses ago 
 I remember you 
 You're the one who said I love you too 
 Didn't you know 
 I remember too 
 A distant bell 
 And stars that fell 
 Like rain out of the blue 
 I miss you darling 
 When my life is through 
 And the angels ask me to recall 
 The thrill of them all 
 Then I will tell them I remember you"
58,George Michael,pop,Secret Love,"Once I had a secret love 
 That lived within the heart of me 
 All too soon my secret love 
 Became impatient to be free 
 So I told a friendly star 
 The way that dreamers often do 
 Just how wonderful you are 
 And why I'm so in love with you 
 Now I shout it from the highest hill 
 I even told the golden dafodill 
 At last my heart's an open door 
 And my secret love's no secret anymore 
 Now I shout it from the highest hill

 Let me fly away with you

 And wild is the wind

 Give me more than one caress 
 Satisfy this hungriness 
 Let the wind blow through your heart 
 Oh wild is the wind 
 Wild is the wind 
 You touch me 
 I hear the sound of mandolins 
 You kiss me 
 With your kiss my life begins 
 You're spring to me 
 All things to me

 Clings to the tree 
 Oh my darling cling to me

60,George Michael,pop,Where Or When,"When you're awake 
 The things you think 
 Come from the dreams you dream 
 Thought has wings, 
 And lots of things 
 Are seldom what they see 
 Sometimes you think you've lived before 
 All that you live today 
 Things you do come back to you 
 As though they knew the way 
 Oh, the tricks your mind can play 
 It seems we stood and talked like this before 
 We looked at each other in the same way then 
 But I can't remember where or when 
 The clothes you're wearing and the clothes you wore 
 The smile you are smiling you were smiling then 
 But I can't remember where or when 
 Some things that happen for the first time 
 Seem to be happening again 
 And so it seems that we have met before 
 And laughed before 
 And loved before 
 But who knows where or when 
 It seems we stood and talked like this before 
 We looked at each other in the same way then 
 But I can't remember where or when 
 The clothes you're wearing and the clothes you wore 
 The smile you are smiling you were smiling then 
 But I can't remember where or when 
 Some things that happen for the first time 
 Seem to be happening again 
 And so it seems that we have met before 
 And laughed before 
 And loved before 
 But who knows where or when"
61,George Michael,pop,Patience,"It's like a conversation, where no-one stops to breathe 
 Is it my imagination, or did God already leave the table? 
 Such destruction, and pure white castles in the sand 
 No time for introduction 
 With all that money changing hands 
 And the satellite says, ""Take a look at all we have"" 
 But the old man says, 
 ""You want my family, for your liberty, I can't do that."" 
 Look into the eyes of any patient man 
 Whether they be amber, green or blue, 
 There's a piece of God staring back at you 
 But they see our children, and the old folk fend for themselves 
 They see our broken women 
 On imaginary shelves 
 But the satellite says, ""Won't you people look at all we have? 
 Don't you want it? Can't you see the things that you lack?"" 
 Children in his arms, he turns his back."
62,George Michael,pop,Amazing,"I was a mixed up when you came to me 
 Too broke to fix, except daddy get your gun 
 I'm missing my baby, 
 Still missing my baby 
 I was a stitched up by the hands of fate 
 Said how you gonna make it on your own 
 If luck is a lady, 
 Maybe luck is a lady 
 I was going down for the third time 
 My heart was broken, I was not open to your suggestions 
 I had so many questions 
 That you just kissed away 
 Tell me, 
 I guess that cupid was in disguise 
 The day you walked in and changed my life 
 I think it's amazing 
 The way that love can you set you free 
 So now I walk in the midday sun 
 I never thought that my saviour would come 
 I think it's amazing 
 I think it's amazing 
 I think you're amazing 
 You tried to save me from myself 
 Said darling, kiss as many as you want 
 My love's still available 
 And I know you're insatiable 
 We're like victims of the same disease 
 Look at your big bad daddy and your mom 
 And your mom, was always acting crazy 
 I was going down for the third time 
 My heart was broken, 
 I though that loving you was out of the question 
 (Loving you was out of the question) 
 Then I saw my reflection (reflection) 
 Saying please don't let this go 
 Tell me, 
 I guess that cupid was in disguise 
 The day you walked in and changed my life 
 I think it's amazing 
 The way that love can you set you free 
 So now I walk in the midday sun 
 I never thought that my saviour'd come 
 I think it's amazing 
 I think you're amazing 
 (Celebrate the love of the one you're with) x18 
 Celebrate this life with you baby 
 I'd think you should celebrate, yeah 
 Don't put your love in chains, babe 
 Now I walk in the midday sun 
 I never thought I would see love 
 I think it's amazing 
 I think you're amazing 
 (I said celebrate the love of the one your're with) 
 Celebrate! 
 Celebrate! 
 As this life gets colder 
 And the devil inside 
 Tells you to give up, baby 
 Now I walk in the midday sun"
63,George Michael,pop,John And Elvis Are Dead,"Close friend of mine as a child fell into a slumber 
 No sign of life since 75 
 Then one day he just, what do you know 
 I guess God just called his number 
 He called me up he called me up and said 
 I've been awake about a week 
 I'm thinking about asking the doctor 
 If he could put me back to sleep 
 Then he laughed and said 
 Hey all the girls they look the same 
 Don't they know just what their mothers 
 Paid in blood, and tears to change 
 But the words that made me cry 
 The thing he softly said 
 It stayed with me, it keeps messing with my head 
 He said, ""If Jesus Christ is alive and well 
 Then how come John and Elvis are dead?"" 
 Youth, beautiful youth 
 We walked through the walls until we found the truth 
 And said ""Change it, it's ugly just change it"" 
 Everyone we used to know 
 Must have given up, so long ago 
 You can see it, it's written on their faces 
 And the inside of their clothes 
 But the words that made me cry 
 'Cause I knew just what they meant 
 He turned to me and said 
 ""Hey boy, if Jesus Christ is alive and well 
 Then how come John and Elvis are dead?"" 
 ""Tell me if Jesus Christ is alive and well 
 Then how come Marvin and Elvis are dead?"" 
 I said ""If Jesus Christ is going to save us from ourselves 
 How come peace, love and Elvis are dead?"""

65,George Michael,pop,Round Here,"My daddy got here on the gravy train 
 I guess my mama had a real bad start to the game 
 They went walking and she took his name 
 Round here 
 There was dancing in the afternoons those days 
 Waiting tables, chasing girls with the money he made 
 It was 1957, and love felt the same, love felt the same 
 Frightened little girl, she makes a break 
 Into the arms of' something better 
 Round here 
 I hear my mama call in Kingsbury Park 
 Just me and David and a football that glowed in the dark 
 Waiting patiently to make my mark 
 Round here 
 And I remember my first day at school 
 And I remember trouble, and thinking I was so cool 
 I remember it all, like yesterday 
 Don't you 
 Every time I try to leave this place 
 Something inside says, 'You can do better' 
 Round here 
 So come with me, let me show you where I've lived 
 I want to put my hands in this earth again 
 Music fell like rain to the streets 
 The Specials and The Jam, to The Beat 
 Even though I think I've seen everything there is to see of this world 
 I gotta be thankful that this crowded space 
 Is the place of my birth 
 When all that I wanted, was to be someone. 
 Two little Hitlers in an old church hall 
 Some cheesy covers and those neighbours that banged on the walls 
 Andy says it's time to show them all 
 Round here 
 Please sir, we two have other plans 
 Please sir you would not understand, 
 What's going on 
 Is magical, can't you see 
 That some of us do more than dream 
 Every time I try to leave this place 
 Something inside says, 'Keep on keeping, on and on'.' 
 Around here 
 So come with me, let me show you where I've lived 
 I want to put my hands in this earth again 
 Music fell like rain to the streets 
 The Specials and The Jam, ABC 
 Even though I think I've seen everything there is to see of this world 
 I gotta be thankful that this crowded space 
 Is the place of my birth 
 My birth, 
 In this town, 
 Yes I guess I got to be someone 
 To be somebody

 But she lied 
 I said, 'Show me his face again, tell me again why he died' 
 She said he couldn't wait for the things that I've seen 
 She said he wasn't strong enough, he never dared to dream a life like mine 
 My mother had a brother 
 Over-sensitive and kind 
 Seems it all became too much for him... 
 It seems he took his own life

 Tears in the dirt, and all over your newborn treasure

 I guess he couldn't wait another moment to be free 
 In endless sky'.. 
 But mama will you tell him from your boy 
 The times they changed 
 I guess the world was getting warmer 
 And we got stronger 
 Mother will you tell him about my joy 
 I live each day for him 
 The sun came out, yeah, and I'm just breathing it in 
 (Breathing') 
 My mother had a brother 
 Same desire, different time 
 Seems the empty spaces tortured him 
 Until he took his own life 
 I don't know why I waited so long for love 
 I just don't know what I was thinking of... 
 All that wasted time 
 But mama will you tell him from your boy 
 The times they changed 
 I guess the world was getting warmer 
 While we got stronger 
 Mother will you tell him about my joy 
 I live each day with him 
 Your son came out, yeah, 
 And I'm still breathing it in 
 And I swear now that freedom is here 
 I'm gonna taste it all for you boy 
 I'm bad to the bone, I'm just a little torn 
 I'm making so much love 
 So those of us who have nothing to fear 
 We've got to make damn sure that it was worth it 
 I'm bad to the bone, I'm just a little stoned 
 I'm making so much love 
 I was a prisoner, but he saved me 
 Broke into my dreams and said, 'Who cares?'

 So broken that I never saw you chase the past away 
 My American Angel, he doesn't want to fight (doesn't need to fight)

 Takes away that fear that I carried forever 
 You stopped to wipe away my tears 
 And you stayed forever and more

 Yesterday it seemed my life was colder than December 
 All alone I watched the eagles fly 
 Even the light seemed to have changed 
 In the Californian sky 
 Through all of those battles then you came 
 Stepped out of the fading light 
 Said, 'Baby I'm American, dry your eyes again, 
 Because I'm here to save your life' 
 My American Angel, he doesn't want to fight (doesn't need to fight) 
 My U.S of Angel, holds me in the dead of night 
 Takes away that fear that I carried forever 
 You stopped to wipe away my tears 
 But you stayed forever amore

 You say that's fantasy, I say 'So what, I need a little beauty' 
 So let me in, 
 You know you've kind of got under my skin 
 You know we never see a lot of the action round here 
 My dear 
 You may want to strip again 
 And you look so fine in your Gucci suit 
 And you're making lot more money than your daddy 
 Could have imagined 
 But people can go out of fashion, honey, yeah, any time 
 So take that picture, stop acting so dumb 
 Don't you know that the moment will come 
 I will find someone like you 
 But with something extra, I'm sorry baby 
 I don't know why 
 Said I don't know why that is 
 The systematic breakdown of my community 
 You know I hate my job, I tried to save but God 
 It's just never enough 
 Switch on, the pressure - stops 
 You know the one for me, she's on Fox 
 And she's a little beauty 
 Give me your life, give me your life, I want it 
 'Cause it's lately so freezing out here 
 This side of the glass, life keeps kicking my ass 
 In so many ways, but you make it good 
 Made me the kind of happy that my baby never could 
 (This side of the glass, 
 I know that you would, now Baby) 
 So take that picture, stop acting so dumb 
 Don't you know that the moment will come 
 I will find someone like you 
 But with something extra, I'm so sorry baby 
 I don't know why 
 Said I don't know why that is 
 Precious keeps me company on 
 Keeps me from being alone 
 Because no one comes in the morning 
 And no one comes in the evening time 
 I'd sit and wait for the phone to ring 
 I could be waiting my whole damn life 
 So sick of the same old faces 
 In this street, where nobody talks to me 
 And the funny side of the situation is 
 I don't care, I'll always be there 
 When you come down from the sky 
 And make yourself at home 
 In my house, Baby 
 'Cause these days it's the money, the money 
 The money, honey, or your life 
 I said don't you know you can't have both? 
 I said don't you know you can't have both? 
 I said don't you know you can't have both? 
 Stop acting so dumb 
 The moment will come 
 I will find someone like you 
 Something extra, (always happens baby to me) sorry baby 
 I don't know why (something) 
 Said I don't know why that is 
 (Tell me why that is) 
 You may want to strip again 
 You may want to let me in 
 You may want to sacrifice 
 More than you think is fair or right 
 You may want to think again 
 You may want to watch your friends 
 You may want to change your mind 
 You may wish you could turn back time"
71,George Michael,pop,Please Send Me Someone (Anselmo's Song),"Some people said, if I could only care for you 
 Some people said, he will never love again 
 Some people said, you can see it in his eyes 
 He keeps it all inside and yet ... 
 Some people say, in time, we all teach ourselves to live this way 
 And for a thousand days, I was lost 
 I thought never to be found, 
 Underground 
 And don't you think I'm ready now? 
 So please send me someone to love ... 
 Please send me someone, someone to love 
 As much as I loved you 
 (The way I loved you, darlin') 
 Please, please send me someone, someone to love 
 Please send me someone 
 Any time, any day, any time, any day now 
 Any time any day, any time, any day now 
 Please, please send me someone 
 Just to hold me now that you're gone 
 Some people say, 'I hope you know I'm there for you' 
 Some of the people said - nothing, 
 And nothing was just fine 
 (You know how I get sometimes ...) 
 And for a thousand days, I was lost 
 I said, 'Heaven knows I'm ready to be found', 
 Underground 
 But I think I'm ready now 
 So please send me someone to love 
 Please send me someone, someone to love 
 As much as I loved you 
 Please, please send me someone, someone to love 
 Please send me someone 
 Please send me someone 
 Any time any day any time any day now 
 Any time any day any time any day now 
 Please, please send me someone 
 So say that you will, because the nights are long 
 Without our song to sing 
 Just search the clouds until ... until 
 So say that you will 
 Show me right from wrong, 
 Without our song to sing 
 Just search the clouds until ... until 
 And Darlin' darlin' though I can't replace you, there's a 
 Space in my heart 
 A space that you left in my heart 
 Just give me something that will pull me back from the blue 
 Oh send me someone like you 
 Darlin' darlin' no I can't replace you, there's a space in my heart 
 A space that you left in my heart 
 Just give me something that will pull me back from the blue 
 Please send me someone to love"

73,George Michael,pop,Through,"Is that enough? 
 I think it's over 
 See, everything has changed 
 And all this hatred may just make me strong enough 
 To walk away 
 They may chase me to the ends of the earth 
 But I've got you babe 
 And they may strip me of the things that I've worked for 
 But I've had my say 
 So hear me now 
 I've enough of these chains 
 I know they're of my making 
 No one else to blame for where I stand today 
 I've no memory of truth 
 But suddenly the audience is so cruel 
 So God, hey God you know why I'm through 
 Through 
 I guess it's tough, I guess I'm older 
 And everything must change 
 But all this cruelty and money instead of love 
 People, have we no shame? 
 They may chase me to the ends of the earth 
 But I've got you babe 
 And they may take away the things that I've worked for 
 But you'll pull me through 
 It's so clear to me now 
 I've enough of these chains 
 Life is there for the taking 
 What kind of fool would remain in this cheap gilded cage 
 I've no memory of truth 
 But suddenly the audience is so cruel 
 Oh God, I'm sorry 
 I think I'm through 
 I think I'm through 
 I think I'm, I know I'm'"

75,George Michael,pop,An Easier Affair,"Here comes one for the ladies 
 For the ones who love me 
 To think I thought I could be some kind of family man 
 I told myself I was straight 
 But I shouldn't have worried 
 'Cause my maker had a better plan for me 
 And I'm dancing with the freaks now 
 I'm havin', I'm havin' so much fun 
 What you sow is what you reap now 
 I'll do my dance with everyone 
 I've been getting too much Sun 
 (Yes I'm dancin' with the freaks now) 
 We're havin', we're havin' too much fun for them 
 Look who's talking Guilty feet now 
 Well let me tell you people 
 It's an easier affair 
 Not living my life with other people on my mind 
 No, got nothing to hide from anyone 
 Yes, I'm walking on new air 
 Just living my life 
 Better believe I'm gonna get what's mine 
 See I don't have the time 
 For the haters 
 And all the time that I wasted 
 How careless of me 
 Too young and stupid to see 
 I put my life in their hands 
 (Gonna look for Cupid, man) 
 Oh, and I know that they want me to hate them 
 There's no hurry 
 I'll just have to be the bigger man 
 Dancin' with the freaks now 
 I'm havin', I'm havin' so much fun 
 What you sow is what you reap now 
 I'll do my dance with everyone 
 I've been getting too much Sun 
 If I turn the other cheek now 
 Would that be, would that be too much fun for them? 
 Look who's talking 
 Guilty feet now 
 Well let me tell you people 
 It's an easier affair 
 Not livin' my life with other people on my mind 
 No, got nothing to hide from anyone 
 'Cause I'm walking on new air 
 Just living my life 
 Better believe I'm gonna get what's mine 
 See I don't have the time for the haters 
 Don't let them tell you who you are is not enough 
 Don't let them tell you that it's wrong 
 Or that you won't find love 
 Don't let them use my life to put your future down 
 Don't let them tell you that happiness can't be found 
 For my life 
 Take it to the streets 
 There are stories you can keep 
 They're just passing you by 
 Don't let them tell you who you are is not enough 
 Don't let them tell you that it's wrong 
 Or that you won't find love 
 Don't let them use my life to put your future down 
 Don't let them tell you that happiness can't be found"
76,George Michael,pop,This Is Not Real Love,"[George:] 
 Don't kiss me, darling 
 I want you to hear the things I say 
 I loved you in my way 
 But you know I'm gonna leave you 
 [Mutya:] 
 The clock was always ticking 
 And your heart, 
 Yes, I know your heart is always on the run 
 [George:] 
 I hate what I've become 
 But I'm still gonna leave you 
 And I don't think you should stay for the night 
 [Mutya:] 
 Baby, you know that my flesh is weak 
 You know I simply 
 [Both:] 
 I cannot sleep without you 
 My heart has simply nowhere to go 
 [Mutya:] 
 Nothing to hold 
 Those tears you're crying 
 [George:] 
 Time and time again 
 You take me back in, baby 
 [Mutya:] 
 You don't have to make it plain 
 [Both:] 
 This is not real love 
 [Mutya:] 
 Look at us dancing baby 
 Let's dance and show them all 
 (Dance and show them all) 
 How close we are 
 The lies have worked so far 
 So we go on deceiving 
 [George:] 
 But darling don't you know the time 
 Baby, look at yourself, holding back the tide 
 Like you've got something else up your sleeve 
 That's why I've got to leave 
 [Both:] 
 And I don't think you should stay here tonight 
 (Baby, don't you know that my flesh is weak, you know) 
 I simply I cannot sleep without you 
 But someday I'll have nothing to show 
 (Nothing to show) 
 (Nothing to show) 
 I've nothing to hold 
 [George:] 
 Oh, baby, crying 
 All those simple things 
 That won't come again 
 Oh do I have to make it plain 
 This is not real love 
 And I said this is not real love 
 [Mutya:] 
 Real love 
 Baby, it don't glisten and shine 
 The way it used to 
 [George:] 
 This is not real love (real love) 
 Baby, think of all the promises I made 
 On the day that I seduced you 
 Baby, don't wait for me like some angel of tragedy 
 I have to set you free 
 Darling you should be long gone, 
 Oh, long gone by now 
 You should be with someone, someone 
 [Mutya:] 
 Glisten and shine 
 You promised me 
 [George:] 
 You've gotta face it woman, 
 You ain't ever gonna change me 
 [Mutya:] 
 Where will I go, what do I know 
 About life without you 
 You promised me you'd never leave me, no 
 This is not real love"
77,George Michael,pop,Understand,"Woman, don't you ever wonder 
 Where you'd be if I just walked on by 
 What's your name? 
 Can I take your number? 
 Darling come with me 
 I'm going to change your life 
 When you're young you think you're winning 
 Why worry 'til the babies cry? 
 I was wrong; it's the blues we're singing 
 Chasing after pennies just to survive. 
 And there's no way the gods are hearing me baby 
 They don't even try 
 They don't even try 
 And all the things I said I'd give you 
 Just seem to pass me by 
 No matter how I try 
 I hope you understand 
 This is not what I had planned for us 
 God only knows if my dreams are coming or gone 
 (Are coming or gone) 
 But you're still holding my hand 
 Sweetheart (Sweetheart) 
 And for every single day you're here 
 It's crystal clear 
 That God isn't mad at me at all 
 He ain't mad at me at all 
 And all this praying hard ain't gonna save the day 
 Maybe that's really what I'm guilty of 
 I know we live in times when love is not enough 
 It's not enough 
 (No no no no no) 
 And there's no way the gods are hearing me 
 Baby, they don't even try 
 They don't even try 
 And all the things I said I'd give you 
 Just seem to pass me by 
 (No matter how I try) 
 I hope you understand 
 This is not what I had planned for us 
 Heaven only knows if our dreams are coming or gone 
 (Coming or gone, coming or gone) 
 But you're still holding my hand 
 Sweetheart (Sweetheart) 
 So for every single day that you're here 
 It's crystal clear 
 That God isn't mad at me at all 
 He ain't mad at me at all 
 There's a place in my mind 
 Somewhere we could be fine 
 Where the children would play 
 And we'd eat like kings every day 
 (Some more promises) 
 (Like kings on Christmas Day)"
78,George Michael,pop,December Song (I Dreamed Of Christmas),"Merry Christmas 
 Merry Christmas 
 May your every New Year dream come true 
 Sweet December song 
 The melody that saved me 
 On those less than silent nights 
 When snow would fall upon my bed 
 White sugar from Jesus 
 And take me to the day 
 She could always smile 
 The Virgin Child would always show, you see 
 Just to save me 
 (Just to save me) 
 There was always Christmas time 
 To wipe the year away 
 I guess that morning they'd decided 
 That the war would have to wait 
 There was always Christmas time 
 Jesus came to stay 
 I could believe in peace on Earth 
 And I could watch TV all day 
 So I dreamed of Christmas 
 Maybe since you've gone 
 I went a little crazy 
 God knows they can see (the child) 
 But the snow that falls upon my bed 
 That loving I needed 
 Falls every single day 
 For each and every child 
 The Virgin smiles for all to see 
 But you kept her from me 
 There was always Christmas time 
 To wipe the year away 
 I guess that morning they'd decided 
 That the war would have to wait 
 There was always Christmas time 
 Jesus came to stay 
 I could believe in peace on Earth 
 And I could watch TV all day 
 And so I dreamed of Christmas 
 Yes, I dreamed like you 
 Merry Christmas 
 Merry Christmas 
 May your every New Year dream come true"
79,George Michael,pop,Edith & The King Pin,"The big man arrives 
 Disco dancers greet him 
 Plainclothes cops greet him 
 Small town, big man, fresh lipstick glistening 
 Sophomore jive 
 From victims of typewriters 
 The band sounds like typewriters 
 The big man he's not listening 
 His eyes hold Edith 
 His left hand holds his right 
 What does that hand desire 
 That he grips it so tight 
 Edith in the ring 
 The passed over girls are conferring 
 The man with the diamond ring is purring 
 All claws for now withdrawn 
 One by one they bring 
 His renegade stories to her 
 His crimes and his glories to her 
 In challenge they look on 
 Women he has taken grow old too soon 
 He tilts their tired faces 
 Gently to the spoon 
 Edith in his bed 
 A plane in the rain is humming 
 The wires in the walls are humming 
 Some song some mysterious song 
 Bars in her head 
 Beating frantic and snowblind 
 Romantic and snowblind 
 She says his crime belongs 
 Edith and the Kingpin 
 Each with charm to sway 
 Are standing eye to eye 
 They dare not look away 
 You know they dare not look away 
 Dare not look away 
 To look away 
 Dare not look away"

 I'm back 
 Prouder than ever baby 
 Louder than ever maybe 
 One more pill 
 Just one more beer 
 One less star in the atmosphere 
 For us 
 Maybe she just wanted to be free 
 Heartless pictures on TV 
 Change that channel that could've been me 
 I said 
 Maybe she just wanted to be free 
 So I just kept breathing my friends 
 Waiting for the man to choose 
 Saying this ain't the day that it ends

 Or the way that you prayed for me? 
 Guess either way I thank you

 Hotel Motel makes it clear 
 One more voice we will never hear again 
 But maybe he just wanted to be free 
 And I don't know what the hell 
 What the gods what the fuck 
 I was saying half the time 
 But something divine 
 Oh divine 
 Brought me back to you

 Said I just got to keep on breathing

 'Til your singing eyes and fingers 
 Drew me loving to your isle 
 And you sang 
 Sail to me 
 Sail to me 
 Let me enfold you 
 Here I am 
 Here I am 
 Waiting to hold you 
 Did I dream you dreamed about me? 
 Were you hare when I was fox 
 Now my foolish boat is leaning 
 Broken lovelorn on your rocks, 
 For you sing, ""Touch me not, touch me not, come back tomorrow: 
 O my heart, O my heart shies from the sorrow"" 
 But I'm as puzzled as the newborn child 
 I'm as riddled as the tide: 
 Should I stand amid the breakers? 
 Should I lie with Death my bride? 
 Hear me sing, ""Swim to me, swim to me, let me enfold you: 
 Here I am, here I am, waiting to hold you"""
82,George Michael,pop,Let Her Down Easy,"You're top man on scene 
 You don't think life comes in between 
 But hey, she's just seventeen 
 She feels like she's a worldly girl 
 But man you've been around the world 
 She is just some worried daddy's girl 
 Even though there's nothing I can say 
 To cheat you and nature any way 
 Let her down easy 
 Her heart is on a dime 
 Let her down easy 
 And she'll grow up in time 
 In her strawberry eyes 
 The way she sees you signifies 
 That she's susceptible to your velvet lies 
 But if you must lay her down 
 May a butterscotch glow be her dressing gown 
 Please do not lead her on when, oh when you leave town 
 Even though there's nothing I can say 
 To cheat you and nature any way 
 Let her down easy 
 Her heart is on the line 
 Let her down easy 
 And you'll grow up in time 
 She's a woman now 
 With a daughter to make her proud 
 In her crayon world of paper clouds 
 She still remembers you 
 The first boy that she gave it to 
 And she laughs at how little then she knew 
 Even though there's nothing I can say 
 To cheat you and nature any way 
 Let her down easy 
 Her heart is on a dime 
 Let her down easy 
 And she'll grow up in time 
 Whoa in time"

 I'm going to a place that is already been disgraced 
 I'm gonna see some folks who have already been let down 
 I'm so tired of America 
 I'm gonna make it up for all of the Sunday Times 
 I'm gonna make it up for all of the nursery rhymes 
 They never really seem to want to tell the truth 
 I'm so tired of you America 
 Making my own way home 
 Ain't gonna be alone 
 I got a life to lead America 
 I got a life to lead 
 Tell me do you really think you go to hell for having loved? 
 Tell me and not for thinking every thing that you've done is good 
 (I really need to know) 
 After soaking the body of Jesus Christ in blood 
 I'm so tired of America 
 (I really need to know) 
 I may just never see you again or might as well 
 You took advantage of a world that loved you well 
 I'm going to a town that has already been burned down 
 I'm so tired of you America 
 Making my own way home 
 Ain't gonna be alone 
 I got a life to lead America 
 I got a life to lead 
 I got a soul to feed 
 I got a dream to heed 
 And that's all I need 
 Making my own way home 
 Ain't gonna be alone 
 I'm going to a town that has already been burned down"
84,George Michael,pop,Idol,"He was a light star 
 Tripping on a high wire 
 Bulldog stubborn 
 Born uneven 
 A classless creature 
 A man for all seasons 
 But don't bet them 
 They can't take him 
 To the very bottom 
 Because they made him 
 And they'll waste him 
 And I don't believe 
 That I want to watch them 
 'Cause the fifties shifted out of gear 
 He was an idol then 
 Now he's an idol here 
 But his face has changed 
 Oh he's not the same no more 
 And I have to say 
 That I like the way his music sounded before 
 He was tight-assed 
 Walking on broken glass 
 Highly prized in the wallet size 
 The number one crush 
 In a schoolgirl's eyes 
 But don't pretend 
 That it won't end 
 In the depth of your despair 
 You went from lame suits 
 Right down to tennis shoes 
 To peanuts 
 From the lion's share 
 'Cause the fifties shifted out of gear 
 He was an idol then 
 Now he's an idol here 
 But his face has changed 
 Oh he's not the same no more 
 And I have to say 
 That I like the way his music sounded before"
85,George Michael,pop,Careless Whisper (Extended Mix),"Time can never mend 
 The careless whispers of a good friend 
 To the heart and mind 
 Ignorance is kind 
 There's no comfort in the truth 
 Pain is all you'll find 
 Should've known better 
 I feel so unsure 
 As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor 
 As the music dies, something in your eyes 
 Calls to mind the silver screen 
 And all its sad good-byes 
 I'm never gonna dance again 
 Guilty feet have got no rhythm 
 Though it's easy to pretend 
 I know your not a fool 
 Should've known better than to cheat a friend 
 And waste the chance that I've been given 
 So I'm never gonna dance again 
 The way I danced with you 
 Time can never mend 
 The careless whispers of a good friend 
 To the heart and mind 
 Ignorance is kind 
 There's no comfort in the truth 
 Pain is all you'll find

 Guilty feet have got no rhythm 
 Though it's easy to pretend 
 I know your not a fool 
 Should've known better than to cheat a friend 
 And waste this chance that I've been given 
 So I'm never gonna dance again 
 The way I danced with you 
 Never without your love 
 Tonight the music seems so loud 
 I wish that we could lose this crowd 
 Maybe it's better this way 
 We'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say 
 We could have been so good together 
 We could have lived this dance forever 
 But now who's gonna dance with me? 
 Please stay 
 And I'm never gonna dance again 
 Guilty feet have got no rhythm 
 Though it's easy to pretend 
 I know your not a fool 
 Should've known better than to cheat a friend 
 And waste the chance that I've been given 
 So I'm never gonna dance again 
 The way I danced with you 
 (Now that you're gone) Now that you're gone 
 (Now that you're gone) What I did's so wrong 
 That you had to leave me alone"
