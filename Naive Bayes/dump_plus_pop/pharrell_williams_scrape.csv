 Yes sir. 
 Let's do this. 
 Yes sir. 
 Yo, On and on and my nuts I'm palming, 
 Take 2 of these and call me in the morning 
 You should see the way the chain heart is to charmin' 
 Flying like a bird like Nelly Furtado 
 Shit pop your bottles toast to screen cheers! 
 Getcha 2-step 'cause it's the record of the year 
 Nigga that brought you ice creams 2 for a pair, 
 Officially announcing that this is warfare 
 'Cause back in the day my clouds was grey 
 And it seemed like my angels couldn't blow them away 
 But then I sold my first verse that cut the NSX 
 But I was still ridin' in them thin ass jets, 
 But now, 
 Made my business so clear out the window of the leer 
 And I'm talking on my celly all this shit that you should hear, 
 Listen clearly now, 
 Hello, can you hear me now? 
 Can I have it like that? 
 You got it like that

 So act like your tryin' to get this money right quick, 
 So can I have it like that? 
 You got it like that 
 Can I have it like that? 
 You got it like that 
 On and on and this beat is zoning, 
 I control the mind straight over the phone, 
 Let 'em explore the words something like a tourist, 
 They never get addicted unless the haddy wibes the surice... 
 From Louisdales to Jimmy Chaos is real, 
 She knows the time she sees the richard mille, 
 Flat double skeletal tourbillon 
 It's just like her body move it turns her on, 
 She like the way my hands use her body for hand warmers, 
 And all our car doors go up like Transformers 
 See I can do it this-a-way I can do it that-a-way 
 From the crib in Viginia to that new Miami getaway 
 So cool like new edition that she hollas your scent, 
 I'll get it okay, let it boil away, 
 But please run along, 'cause ladies is feelin' wrong, 
 And I got some right for 'em right after this song 
 'Cause my name is Skate-Board-P 
 Ladies and gentlemen, 
 Can I have it like that? 
 You got it like that 
 Can I have it like that? 
 You got it like that

 You got it like that 
 So act like your tryin' to get this money right quick, 
 So can I have it like that? 
 You got it like that 
 Can I have it like that? 
 You got it like that 
 On and on and the temperatures warming 
 I spit heat flashes, niggas get nautious, 
 Bright as a bitch 
 So analyze with caution 
 When the light hit the ice bet a 100 that you vomit 
 Should I mention the fact the transition is the track? 
 No one change into the vision just to get me where I'm at 
 No skateboy P too grown 
 Riding up and down college in that new 2 tone 
 It's so cold you don't wanna feel the chill of it. 
 Uh! 
 Just stand back and just look at the grill of it. 
 Uh! 
 I don't smoke but I bet the... love it! 
 It totally intensifies VIVD ass appeal of it, 
 You could be jealous, and grit your teeth, 
 But all these little niggas got something in reach 
 While on my boat party trying to sunseek, 
 Ladies and gentlemen, 
 Can I have it like that? 
 You got it like that 
 Can I have it like that? 
 You got it like that 
 Can I have it like that? 
 You got it like that 
 Can I have it like that? 
 You got it like that 
 So act like your tryin' to get this money right quick, 
 So can I have it like that? 
 You got it like that 
 Can I have it like that? 
 You got it like that."
1,Pharrell Williams,pop,How Does It Feel?,"Woo woo! [in background] 
 Yes sir! Aha 
 New Skateboard P 
 Hey! 
 Let's go get 'em 
 Uh-huh 
 Yo, hola. 
 Mearle maire, club muchacho 
 Asorted flavours, in they solatos 
 Inspire young minds, stacked by Nato's 
 With the right determination of a patho 
 Running 'cross the water with bricks at his poncho 
 Face like a shoot when it's bussin' my glock hold 
 Vanity stings, till I die when the holy father hands me my wings 
 When I was young yo the teacher gave me stanity dreams 
 Giving me music like... and they handed me things, they shoot it up 
 See me on the TV, the cuties they wanna... 
 Both presidential and plus, they hoop it up 
 Got more hits in his zip, who want enough 
 I can go back in time, you be Judge Eato 
 With my men and depedo I know you thinkin' Neato 
 Givin' peace to minutes, something like your T-Vo 
 But it's 3 hundred thousand more with no remote 
 Take it in the rain, I used to live with Tito 
 But he clowned me and told me that my money's free-doughs 
 Now the Enzo doors go up like a Dilo 
 Reon, same song some from my man Nigo 
 SLR, when the doors go up it's like a fresh elle jar 
 Nigga we boss, he shall not get hot, he too frost 
 Yes sir... 
 My nigga close your eyes, 
 Just picture you're self just holdin' pies 
 Impliment a plan and and you'll surely rise 
 Just promised by the man that controls the skies 
 Don't you see, I know that shit's so ill 
 Better yet, dawg, just tell me how you feel 
 ...How you feel dawg? 
 We just picture thinking, dreaming, scheming, breathing, reading, all in the late night 
 Shaking, boiling, lacing, bacon, shaking, shaping, gotta get this cake right 
 As I serve it, you just burn it, breathe it, learn it, now watch you take flight 
 ...My nigga how does it feel? 
 Ha ha! Yes sir! 
 Nigga you don't know me 
 I'm part Howard Hues, part horny, part holy 
 First trip on the ramp is the rock and rolly 
 Keep one on my staff with a new pro-chromy 
 If they priest need the mention that I've been biten 
 But a force be the chocolate where critics are written 
 He dresses insane where his music admire 
 Ask anyone from Vouge and Esquire And Vanity Fair you like can of the year 
 But you should guess who's in insanity chair 
 Now it ain't about what I want 
 Still thumbing through my life like a star born 
 It's one thing to say you did it 
 It's one thing to lie about your didgits 
 It's one thing to say that you live it 
 It's another for you fuckers to admit it 
 But I admit I got all this paper plus the prettiest faces that's off of our nature 
 I drive a Casper, s'cuse me Cassper, wanted meet me at my house, I got space like NASA 
 And it'll make me happy buy yourself a Sattle 
 Unlike my sister Stacy when she lost her papa 
 I been there, gettin' stroke and nothing to trap-uh 
 John could do, when surrounded with true 
 A man dies, baby born, as far as Peru 
 It's a simple proof between us and imposters 
 We hop in the air, and don't care what it costs us 
 Now I'm with NERD with a pit full of Martians 
 I guess you could say that we fly like saucers 
 Zapping at niggas, with classing and figure 
 The cash and class whippers 
 The thrashing mag ripper 
 Go 'head and say it 
 Yes sir! 
 My nigga close your eyes, 
 Just picture you're self just holdin' pies 
 Impliment a plan and and you'll surely rise 
 Just promised by the man that controls the skies 
 Don't you see, I know that shit's so ill 
 Better yet, dawg, just tell me how you feel 
 ...How you feel dawg? 
 We just picture thinking, dreaming, scheming, breathing, reading, all in the late night 
 Shaking, boiling, lacing, bacon, shaking, shaping, gotta get this cake right 
 As I serve it, you just burn it, breathe it, learn it, now watch you take flight 
 ...My nigga how does it feel? 
 Ha ha! Yes sir! 
 Nigga you don't know me..."

 Yup 
 Little skateboard p 
 Yes sir 
 Yes sir 
 Yes sir 
 Yes sir 
 Ma the way you huggin' on me is a problem what the fuck you tryin' to end up in the gossip column 
 I know I got jewels like I'm the pharroah of the ghetto 
 But we are in the bright ass shiny carrara 
 Stickin' your feet out the window so they can see your stillettos 
 Costs a thousand dollahs same as your house 'n' holla 
 Not to mention your wrists and the 30,000 collah 
 Pussy must be good he's victim to your power... shit 
 That nigga like me I would never allow it 
 Spit that shit on me I'd ask you haveyou showered 
 You wanna get up in my boat and ride 
 Take pictues of with the kid up in ocean drive 
 Go to casatua and sip on calluas at the bar talking to other women about the best jewelers 
 You would like that huh... 
 Smile and still call your girlfriend 
 Who fell asleep at the wheel 
 Don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit... raspy shit 
 Don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit... raspy shit 
 Don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit... raspy shit 
 Don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit tryin' to ask me shit 
 Hey yo I walk in brashest 
 Certainly the crassest 
 The restuarants classes 
 The owners is ass 
 My money is green like the helmet of a fashess 
 So what you want patrone no patrussi in glasses 
 Ain't no mystery his daughter knows the history 
 And every night we toast like its victory get with me 
 And I ain't change sense my early intel 
 I've been snackin on shrimp and sippin on shirrley temples 
 What you want 
 No seriously what you thinkin' sense the yukon 
 Never puffed a jay you ask lou shaun 
 Back when he pushed babes like it was like coupons 
 With a house full of dames like it was moulon 
 I would ask there name but they would only do shaun 
 And I ain't sayin' they regret it but fuck would they do but if they could reverse time what the fuck would they do 
 Don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit... raspy shit 
 Don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit... raspy shit 
 Don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit... raspy shit 
 Don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit tryin' to ask me shit 
 Honeys pandomania eyes like a rainion lighter than the blue of the sky or the day we in 
 Ass like a volleyball 
 Kind that make your dick hard 
 Head to the hustlas so sweet she can get cars 
 Now she here with me little skateboard p cheaper than the sound of a bird that chirps 
 I spit then I hit then I murk yes sir 
 I flick chicos sticks and a twix that's her 
 She admire how a champion lives how I sign Ja Rule with a ramp in my crib 
 I'm a champion I do as a champion did except I improve with the new and the rest get rid 
 But some y'all don't like that it seems you tryin' to bite back instead of sayin' hi gettin' fly but I'll be right back 
 My dude got the skills if you think your fly 
 Shoot the wings of your egoand watch you sky dive 
 Don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit... raspy shit 
 Don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit... raspy shit 
 Don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit... raspy shit 
 Don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit tryin' to ask me shit."
3,Pharrell Williams,pop,Best Friend,"Yeah, ye... spit my gum out right now... haha 
 What up world? Got my insperation in the studio with me, right?...feelin' good 
 Got a lot to smile about, ahaha, talk to y'all niggas... yessur, hey 
 My best friend say I'm bottled up, I need a fucking therapist 
 But I can't think of nobody I wanna share this with 
 Why should I open up on somebody elses carelessness... 
 (Cork pops) There goes the top, nigga, so here it is 
 Mama workin' all day, Daddy out in the streets 
 Imagine 10 years old full of doubt and defeat 
 Growing up around criminals, with clout and deceat 
 My grandma Loucelle used to tell me, you about what you wheap 
 She used to help me with my homework, addiction-subtraction 
 Added faith to my life and doubt got subtracted 
 Wanna skip ya mind from crying better learn something, son 
 You be beatin' on my couches, why don't you try hit the drums 
 Look, ooh you see me ma 
 They wish they could be me ma 
 As I got better, her body was eaten by Luchimia 
 Seventh grade, it was cursed and sad 
 But the gift within it, was when I first met Chad 
 But even Chad could tell you that my Christmas was jinxed 
 'Cause grandma Loucelle died on 12th 19th 
 I can't help but wonder, what kind of black cloud I was under 
 'Cause 15 years later the other died that summer... bummer 
 My best friend told me, you be actin' tough, that's fine 
 But the weight of the world can really crush one's mind 
 So let it out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what). 
 See, you won't even know you hurt sometimes, until you in conversation it comes out in a line so let it 
 Out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what), my nigga let it out 
 Aye yo, 10 21 Atlantis drive, nigga was action packed 
 That's Atlantis apartments, we live in half the back 
 That's where the 12 year olds there, they wbe flashing crack 
 And when they shoot you nigga, they ain't tryin' to pass it back 
 Aye yo, Diggy, Fleet and Marvian can you imagine that? 
 The place we love the most, the hood was built to smash us flat 
 But I escaped 'cause I chased, what made me passion that 
 Now I got my skate team and spit these acid raps 
 So many niggas will rise 
 So many them niggas try 
 So many them niggas ended up duck-taped and tied 
 So many them same niggas, man they moms eyes cry 
 So, they just got older, still on the corner with they pride 
 Well let me tell niggas something, I'm so glad you alive 
 Long as you got a breathe, a pulse, nigga strive 
 Devine intervention this is 
 I heard a voice nigga, listen to this 
 My best friend told me, you be actin' tough, that's fine 
 But the weight of the world can really crush one's mind 
 So let it out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what). 
 See, you won't even know you hurt sometimes, until you in conversation it comes out in a line so let it 
 Out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what), my nigga let it out 
 Jesus will arange it, but Jesus wont change it 
 Hold yourself responsible, on yourself you blame it 
 You mad, nigga don't articulate and ??, 
 I.E. we best friends, speak best friends language 
 I'm a happy nigga, you can't approach me in anguish 
 Whoever said anything worth working for would be painless 
 Can't be mad at the world 'cause you and your girl ain't famous 
 'Cause you both on bate, BBC and chainless 
 Also your rangless, therefore switch laneless 
 Now you brainless, dangerous, 'cause you pull out the stainless 
 All of sudden you smart, now you do something hainess 
 First time you get caught, now your ass is famous 
 No longer chainless, and the bus switching lanes is a bad look 
 Yo girl with ya man sellin' laneless, Stop 
 Nigga rewind and reverese slides 3 times 
 Reassess your thinking and trust me it'll be fine 
 First pitcure your goal, and repeat 'It'll be mine' 
 Or fuck it nigga, just keep imagine killin' me fine 
 Now you, scruntching your face tryna ace attainment 
 When you should be tryna find a place to base your shame, nigga 
 Sucess is taingeable, don't wait for fame 
 I thought you would receive it better if I ain't say ya name 
 You unsure of yourself, sit still and think 
 Review those actions if it fit, put your name in the blank 
 My best friend told me, you be actin' tough, that's fine 
 But the weight of the world can really crush one's mind 
 So let it out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what). 
 See, you won't even know you hurt sometimes, until you in conversation it comes out in a line so let it 
 Out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what), my nigga let it out 
 Star Track, is who we are. (x4)"
4,Pharrell Williams,pop,You Can Do It Too,"My nigga you can do it too (turn me up, turn me up) 
 You can do it too 
 My nigga you can do it too 
 You can do it too 
 You can do it too (Just tellin' you, ya know?) 
 Aiyyo 
 Never in a million years I'll imagine I'll get my thrills 
 By listening to squeals of PJ wheels 
 As we land I duck down, I stick my head up my dick is 
 Being sucked down, by a bitch named what now 
 I look in her eyes, and her eyes are like an orange stars 
 Look at the reflection of my foreign car by R & R 
 I stick my feet out, you know the bapes that's made of eel 
 You know the new checks with nigo face right on the heel 
 I was a marching band, I was a skateboader 
 Jesus made wine, I couldn't make water 
 Ox-moronic, I'm here to destroy all you hate hoarders 
 You niggaz were cool in school now you niggaz take orders 
 I'm not dissin your job 
 But now you listen and nod 
 Some mount the limit shit, I know this position is odd 
 Don't Gasp for air 
 You can turn blue 
 Look, accel nigga 
 Trust me you can do it 
 You can do it too young blood 
 You can do it too young love 
 Just watch what you do young blood 
 And watch whose in your crew young blood 
 It don't matter if you do drugs, 
 And even if you threw slugs 
 You can do it too young blood 
 I did you can do it too 
 (Verse Two) 
 I know niggaz are like there's no returning when I 
 Bought that white five-fifth 
 So white that the coke heads just might try sniff 
 I ordered the phatom coupe, that's smoke pipe grey 
 And the interior was like crack white beige 
 At least that's what it looked like when it was on that page 
 I combed the whole brochure and it did not say, oh well 
 Life's a bitch but not too extreme 
 Life's got a fat ass, Trust me I'ma fuck full steam 
 I make the world cream and scream, while I'm gettin' my cream 
 I'm coming to America call me Prince Akeem, yessir 
 It's kinda weird, 'cause this I dream 
 Kinda prophetic ya get it 'cause this I seen 
 These type of visions, since I's teen 
 I told my teacher what I saw, she said I missed byzine 
 Laughed with the class with the slightest clue 
 You be buying my shit, and I be rappin' to you, but you can do it too 
 (Verse Three) 
 I know you heard the story about the dude with the attitude 
 Pharrell he don't even know you but he mad at you 
 He got robbed and it seems he has a huge 
 He's frustrated and that it all he has is you 
 So, things propel and things excel 
 The next the a bing comes out the barrell 
 And my man they accused him of sittin' tight up in jail 
 Ironic he close my man luke can hear him yell 
 I ain't do it but somebody dropped him flat 
 I felt the wind from it, that was God cocking back 
 I got a call from Virginia grandma went back 
 The line was fluctuated but it just now went flat 
 See her body went down and her soul went up 
 She sent angels around me so evil could not touch 
 I don't lie no more and I'm haunted when I fuck 
 Wealthy niggaz with a conscience, yeah you know what's up 
 The wires across, and it's breeding a plague 
 The conscience is hungry, and it's eating away 
 Trying to make sense of it, but it's speedy in vain 
 Up all night with the books and you read till the day 
 But still ya house of diddy 'cause you got a little paper 
 Push a cat in the corner, trust me it's the nature 
 Never underestimate the-things you do 
 Read your verse too, inhale the ""ooh"", and go 
 (Man Singing) 
 Don't be afraid to look up the sky (8X)"

 We consider and read her 
 Man, she might be the type that want P to feed her 
 She wants a little cheaper, a little margarita 
 Mane, them draws comin' off when she see the two-seater 
 So put your Porche up, uh 
 Get your divorce up, uh 
 I'm sure she'll sign it when she seen me put my doors up 
 Mane, them niggas only wanna mothafucker here 
 She threw her heels in the ocean, so she stuck to chill 
 The trunk is still, hopin' there's something between ya 
 Now she laughin' how she took your ass to the cleaners 
 Mane, I'm on your side, not tryin' to inconvient 
 Just know we got them mean keys in them plastic meaners 
 So keep it player dawg, 
 Don't make me say it, naw 
 Do something drastic, know that plastic heavy weighing, dawg 
 If it ain't music, or this money, I don't play at all 
 And she ain't either, so that means she doesn't weight at all 
 Now we can both post sip or keep it playa mane 
 And we can both pull a misses, keep it playa mane 
 Or we grind our wrists and keep it playa mane 
 Or you can scram cocksucker if you a hater mane

 I'm a grown mane, Thug ain't the one to play no games with ya 
 Rule the one to call and come get out the chain with ya 
 And hang with ya, when ya full of Patron 
 And oh yeah, brang one of ya cute partnas along 
 Because I'm only 25, and still going live 
 I got the estate by the pool, by the lake outside 
 I wake up and gotta pick which car I'm a drive 
 The Double R 760, or the 645, I'm 
 Havin' thangs, mane, check out the chain 
 Money ain't never been a thang 
 You see watch and the rang 
 The watch and the rang 
 Rocks the nicest, never seen nothin' like this 
 I'm a Boss I on' ask what it cost, my life priceless 
 Baby girl you might just 
 Get the shatter shine 
 Long as you not selfish or learn to share sometimes 
 And of course I'm still you'res and you're still mine 
 But you can't be a hater, mane 
 You gotta keep it playa, mane 
 Now we can both post sip or keep it playa mane 
 And we can both pull a misses, keep it playa mane 
 Or we grind our wrists and keep it playa mane 
 Or you can scram cocksucker if you a hater mane 
 I keep 'em ladies going 
 (Verse 3: Pharrell) 
 They say J. Lo shouldn't show her ass and all 
 Knowin' the worst thing could happen is a nigga could palm 
 Now my agent sayin' the only way that he could be calm 
 I put a hundred mil on each song, like my name was Lebron 
 Not the ice, my beat is worth more 
 Attractive like a whole damn Jacob store 
 See niggas hate you more when you take they broad 
 But his girl looked in my ear and seen her matrix door 
 Dude's is foolish, they hues us to chew us 
 I mean, the Smurfs, the green, the rocks is so bluish 
 You can't out bling me, or BBC jean me 
 You ain't got no vibrate, you can go and ask MiMi 
 I think and relay it 
 I blink and PJ it 
 You wanna make fast bucks, take this and Ebay it 
 And all you Phantom owners know why you can't stand me 
 Got one in Virginia, 'nother one in Miami 
 Yes sir 
 Now we can both post sip or keep it playa mane 
 And we can both pull a misses, keep it playa mane 
 Or we grind our wrists and keep it playa mane 
 Or you can scram cocksucker if you a hater mane 
 I keep 'em ladies going."

 You ever been in love before? 
 Let me holla at you mann 
 You know it's hard for a playa to admit that sometimes 
 But I'm a spit that sumtimes 
 You know wat I'm sayin' 
 Ay p, give it to 'em one time, nephew 
 (Pharrell and Charlie:) 
 There's sumthin bout this girl 
 From around my way 
 Ever try to hold back your feelings, 
 But it just wouldn't stay? 
 But when I finally found the words to say 
 I wanted to run away 
 Simply run away 
 (Pharrell:) 
 You can try to run and hide 
 It wont make a difference 
 You can lie to urself 
 Of the reason 
 Sure it hurts wen it comes to ur attention 
 That you're in love with the girl 
 Yessir, that's her 
 But it wasn't like that back wen I met her 
 The lavish life from all the do? spun 
 Before the double R had the hitchhike thumb 
 Her friends didn't like niggas like us but i 
 Arrested the coochie and her feelings got cuffed 
 Spiderweb sex, must'a got caught up 
 But there's more to it 
 I remember once 
 Sayin' let's shit on the peons 
 Let's go ta vegas nd watch celine dion 
 Make 'em say 'wat we on?? 
 You say no like you was doin' it for eons 
 Fuck it, I'll just hum and let the watch give off the neons 
 Wen it rains it pours 
 I laughs to myself wen I change the score 
 You said my sex was a lot but my brain gave you more 
 And sumn bout how ya ex was a toy 
 I guess he played games 
 There's only diamond dice here 
 Not tryin' ta justify 
 But wen ya shut ya eye you can touch the sky 
 You in trouble ma 
 And you should pray about speed 
 But if this 'bout you 
 Wat that say about me? 
 (Pharrell and Charlie:) 
 But when I finally found the words to say 
 I wanted to run away 
 Simply run away 
 (Pharrell:) 
 U can try to run and hide 
 It wont make a difference 
 U can lie to urself 
 Of the reason 
 Sure it hurts wen it comes to ur attention 
 That ur in love with the girl 
 (Snoop Dogg:) 
 See I'm a crip in dark blue chucks 
 And I does wat I does 
 Yeah I might say 'cause? 
 It's really weird 'cause a nigga got love 
 Snop Dogg's a crip and the girl was a what?? 
 She told me that her baby-daddy was a thug 
 Now it is wat it is and it was how it was 
 I'm hollin lil mama like wat 
 Money mo stacked tryin' ta get my g's back 
 All these memories breed seeds of a rhythm rhyme pleaser 
 Laid back while we sippin on a breeza 
 Fresh 4-pack sittin' in the freeza 
 Ain't that kadeeja? I heard she was a Skeeza? 
 She used ta hit them licks wit the Beezas 
 Wen I seen her wit the homies, I was like ?JESUS!? 
 It's been a lil min since I seen her 
 Hope her man don't run up 'cause ill have to pull the neena 
 (Pharrell and Charlie:)

 I wasn't tryin' to lead her on 
 See I didn't wanna be alone 
 But when she smiles she brought me home 
 So I brought her home, 
 It's not that the feelin' of love is gone 
 Can't expect a kind little girl to be grown 
 I can't give a fuck what so and so says 
 Crushes hurt both ways 
 What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?

 Let them galardo doors up

 I ain't here to try to rewrite your past 
 That don't measure up to the nights that we laughed 
 When considering love you take the Good with the bad 
 I've been disappointed by every bitch I ever had 
 Either she was dick crazy or cheddar mad 
 Shame what they did for them jeans and them leather bags 
 Reverse it I want perfect 
 That was half the reason I bought half them purses 
 That chapter is over, it was worth it, my My new angel surface, 
 She ain't have to rehearse, My baby's real 
 That's why I put the chill on her 
 So good make a... wanna kneel on her, not yet

 Hey, yo 
 In the heart of a re-up, it's somthin' like a G up 
 MCA fingering that B up or that C up 
 Fiends creep up with their flesh lookin' beat up 
 And my tennis ball is stuffed with enough work to fill a tea cup 
 He opened up his jacket 
 I opened up my packet 
 He pulled out his money 
 I'm pullin' out that honey 
 He stuff it in his stem soon as he took it from me 
 Yellow teeth chaffed lips and his nose is runny 
 He lit that shit, he hit that quick as if I was high 
 I asked him where them bricks at shit 
 He smiled as if he was payin' homage 
 He said in the back of the apartment 
 Where they be selling ganja 
 But beware of the AK held by HM Thomas 
 Son gotta keep him high in them bottoms or some old pyjamas 
 I said shit ma nigga take another hit 
 We ran up in that crib with them Uzis and them Sigs 
 Give up the work or we tyin' up the kids 
 Did I get that work, what you think? Yes I did 
 I didn't actually that wasn't true and 
 If you aspire to hustle, that's a how to, to you

 You should see me stick that big S on my anso 
 And literally call destructure so no one can touch ya 
 Teenage girls'll love ya and models wanna fuck ya 
 Ice cream ya way on to somebody's magazine cover 
 So much money that the lid threatens eruption and 
 The bank says you don't have to call like you're Usher 
 And I ain't kill or sell drugs to nobody 
 But I know niggas that kill and stretch work like pilates 
 Nigga the crack house was literally right beside me 
 When them fiends hit that shit they kicked just like karate 
 We named one Bruce lie, one slim Kelly 
 Who issued too much quicker than Luis rank and M belly 
 Yeah, I escaped but there's nothing you can tell me 
 'Cause thought I paper chase, my memories won't fail me

 Pull up and them eyes wide open, stack of toys

 The feelin' throbbin' I got it and poppin' phenomanal 
 Nigga signed a million dollar cheque with his pyjamas on 
 Film it like a porno no need to re-word it 
 Nigga the enzo just came and I ain't have to jerk it 
 Yeah, niggas you heard it the perversion of stars 
 I guess if I go in my garage, it'd be a menage 
 Niggas can't hate on this like summer in '84 
 When we high off potato chips 
 New cript and Florida were the soul core corridors 
 Yes them babies mine, fuck I need to go on my reefa 
 Rewire my brain, aspire to attain, tell Jacob 
 Light on the platinum, keep the fire in the chain 
 Yikes I mean ice on the motherfucker gleam 
 I guess if my ice is fire, it leave you niggas stinged 
 See there's you there's me and there's between 
 If you remove the between, you see I achievin' you dreams

 From these sherbet ice creams with a dose of lime 
 I'm strictly Shirley Temple Nigo wants to toast with wine 
 Cheers bitch it can't let you niggas gross my mind 
 With your low ambition and no damn vision 
 Black and white ideas with no precision 
 My mind is like a diamond producing colors like a prism 
 With no knowledge or understanding 
 How the fuck you gonna reach wisdom 
 My mind is reasoning outlast ink and pens 
 If you niggas think you know me niggas think again

 Swagger swagger international 
 Swagger swagger international

 We cannot help who we're attracted to

 In honor of the groove and to all who's surrendered to it 
 We say thank you and we take it back 
 We're so hard, we're so hard that it came true 
 Then my lucky star, I guess you came from behind the moon 
 I put my arms around her and I promise not to abuse you 
 Since now I found you, why the hell would I want to lose you?

 When I open the window 
 I wanna hug you

 Cause when I'm feelin' real low 
 I remember I love you 
 I put my hands in the air 
 And you were there 
 With your love, I can board the skies 
 Running away that electrifies mothership other 
 Can I stow away? 
 Colourful winds of the northern sky 
 Is the closest thing, and here is why 
 Cause we're color 
 You blow me away (blow me away girl) 
 I need it like I breathe it 
 Music and colors can make one hover 
 Who cares if they don't see you? 
 Don't you know that they're the same? 
 I need it like I breathe it 
 If you never discover, forever you'll suffer 
 Who cares if they don't see you?

 When the whale hunts in the sea 
 When man recognizes

 One night with he, and I'll make ya scream 
 You'll wake up, like it's a dream 
 Call downstairs, tell 'em to make us PJs 
 Right after that, dry cycle our PJS 
 Right after that, book us a PJ

31,Pharrell Williams,pop,Maybe (Remix),"(Intro: Maybe {original} bridge plays fast; ""Hold it now"" scratches) 
 Hold it now 
 Y'all hear that? 
 H-H-H-Hold it now 
 H-H-H-Hold it now 
 H-H-H-Hold it now 
 (Beat changes to Maybe {Remix}) 
 (Pharrell talking) 
 Yup 
 This is for all of the consors of fine rhyme you know? 
 I dug deep in the cellars of my mind for this 
 I love y'all niggaz 
 I just wanna air some things out 
 Dear Hip-Hip, ya know? 
 Dear Hip-Hop 
 Dear Hip-Hop: 
 I got a cult following, N*E*R*D is far from Pop G 
 No radio, light spins since the video drop see 
 I'm the turbion of this shit, like Mozart and Bach B 
 I'm-ma show you niggaz what time it is, niggaz watch me 
 My falsetto been hot, like the Sopranos five seasons 
 Alto beats +Grindin+ soundin like +Frontin'+, Niggaz is reachin' 
 I pimped across that stage nigga tipsy off that reason 
 Snatch that Grammy, when I joke I call it G-Thing 
 Ask Robin Leach. How many V-somthins up in my fortress 
 Like Russle Crowe in +Gladiator+, so many fucking horses 
 Porsches, ??? that's white, I call it Ghost 
 Phantom named Nightmare, night scares people the most 
 I introduce BAPE to the world, 400 nigga out fast 
 Favorite group White Stripe, R. Kelly, Kanye and Outcast 
 A R&B producer, I was sittin' on the shelf 
 A Ralph Laurenic nerd then Noreaga gave me help 
 But my samples wouldn't clear, and I couldn't rock a wig 
 And they didn't have pimp cups, and dancin wasn't my gig 
 But shoulder brushin, blazers and trucker hats I did 
 And the only niggaz I ain't work with was Tupac and Big 
 Ha ha 
 You and me 
 BAPE, Ice Cream and BBC (Yup) 
 Just because we skate down the road (Niggaz) 
 Don't mean we can't slam Phantom Doors (Bitches) 
 You and me 
 BAPE, Ice Cream and BBC 
 Just because we skate down the road (love y'all man) 
 Don't mean we can't slam Phantom Doors (You have no idea) 
 Now er'body keep asking me about Kelis 
 She's dope with or without me till I die that's what I speak 
 I never run to the tabloids and run around here grinnin' 
 I'm a peaceful, Rolls Royce drivin' black John Lennon 
 Psychedelic beats, medals on my Solder jacket 
 Fuckin' the baddest bitches in fashion, niggaz could you imagine? 
 Ma, why you even breathin? Why you even talkin'? 
 Put my Big Bang in your Black Hole, I'm Stephen Hawkins 
 If the mind is full of water, can you believe I'm walkin' 
 On your thoughts trust me niggaz what I've achieved is awesome 
 Mind readers you think you know me, proceed with caution 
 Ohup! Eternal sunshine of a spotless mind you lost him 
 I cried when my grandma died, Bob says Josh says 
 If Josh short for Jesus, then I'll sing what Bob says 
 Oh small diamonds are blahsay blahsay 
 Remember 20 carot soilitares can not be paveyed 
 And while my heart has lots of scars hidden 
 My beats is star ridden, givin' trucks and jeeps and cars rhythm 
 Accompanied by 40 bars spittin', not from the prospective of Nasism 
 But as N*E*R*D goes as I start peni-trating minds unlikely fitting 
 Ghetto girls and thugs liking the album guitar driven, Yup! 
 Ghetto girls to girls from the valley 
 To niggaz that skate to niggaz that pump crack in they alleys 
 I'm the Black Card, Timothy Leary, John Lennon lookin' for my Yoko 
 Hopin my wife hears me 
 And maybe she'll have more +Interscope+ and not be a +Virgin+ 
 Who bought my album, and who will prefer the regular version that goes 
 (Maybe {original} chorus plays fast) 
 See, maybe (Haha) 
 There was something wrong (Hoo!) 
 And you were telling me no wrong (What up Black radio? Daddy loves you) 
 See, maybe (Ahhhhoh!) 
 The laugh's on me (Yeah) 
 And life was telling me a joke (joke, joke joke) 
 (Maybe {Remix} scratchs back in) 
 Owwww! 
 You and me 
 BAPE, Ice Cream and BBC 
 Just because we skate down the road (Mean what?) 
 Don't mean we can't slam Phantom Doors (Nigga, nigga) 
 You and me 
 BAPE, Ice Cream and BBC 
 Just because we skate down the road 
 Don't mean we can't slam Phantom Doors (nigga, nigga)

 Hey yo, ladies and gentlemen 
 You could never imagine, what's about to happen right now 
 (Hey yo check this out) 
 (Verse: P. Diddy) 
 Hey yo I'm back by popular demand and shit 
 Niggaz want the crown but can't handle it 
 This rap game's getting scandalous 
 I done lost my best friend in Los Angeles 
 My other nigga turned Evangelist 
 But I can't quit 'cause I'm on some Evander shit 
 Fuck the money and the white sand and shit 
 When it's said and done you gunna understand this shit 
 Your man talking about Hummers and little cars 
 That only fit in his little house little garage 
 His lifestyle is just a little mirage 
 He the type of cat that never had a menage 
 Backrub, you know a little massage 
 Tight shit you get when you Head Nigga in charge 
 I'm in the Rolls listening to the bars 
 Leaned back wit a chick smoking on cigars 
 From Bogota, Colombia, chicks from Panama 
 The diamond fellow, mami hello 
 Pull up in the drop my Ferrari yellow 
 Pull off your top make it shake like Jello 
 (Chorus: Pharrell Williams (Lenny Kravitz)) 
 DROP EVERYTHING! When you walk in the door 
 Free your self 'fore get ya ass on the floor! 
 Ah be a maniac-ah! lose control (just lose control) 
 GET NAKED! Strip down to your soul! 
 (Bridge: Pharrell Williams) 
 Well strip down! (work)

 Is that all you got?! (work) 
 You got to make me believe it girl! (work) 
 C'mon now! 
 (Verse: Pharrell Williams) 
 I'm sitting on your Louie bag, now you're braining it 
 Lookin' like your little sister came that painted it 
 Slick, like calamari tentacles 
 Staring at my chain I kicked off your Jimmy Choos 
 I weigh 155 pound when I'm soaked ma 
 That Rolls Royce Phantom, it ain't no joke ma 
 Weed brownie at 2, but I will not smoke ma 
 Don't talk about licking if it ain't deepthroat ma 
 I give you great dick, I make your face flip 
 Then take ya aboard a nigga Spaceship 
 Star Trak, my fault I mean Mother Ship 
 Put on the cameras, try it you'll be loving it 
 And you can bring your girl and we can get on another tit 
 Me? I'm a Mount Airy fellow 
 Or down in Florida wit the Maranello 
 Driving slow watch the mami mouthing ""hello"" 
 Get wit ya man if you want love you better 
 Trying to get +Dirty+ like +Aguilera+ 
 Yep, he's a skater the kids that's rhyming 
 But I'm also young and rich wit a big ass diamond 
 (Verse: Loon) 
 Hey yo my intro's crazy, I'm in a new Mercedes 
 Rocks the same colors as daisy's 
 Y'all niggaz is lazy, I'm on my j-o-b 
 And that's why ya hate on me 
 But here's the update, Loon ain't got nothing but cake 
 And power from here to upstate 
 Y'all sweet as cupcakes 
 So why niggaz stay wit tough faces? 
 I stay trying to figure what Loon and Puff make 
 (Verse: P. Diddy) 
 Bitch please! you ain't been in a helicopter 
 Flying 'round Jesus statue wit a mountain in Brazil 
 Bitch please! you ain't never been to Guatemala 
 Eating shrimp by the dollar taking flights to Negril 
 Bitch please! and you ain't been wit Lenny and Pharrell 
 Me and Loon in the hills giving mami's the chills 
 Bitch please! and you ain't never seen a hotter nigga in the game 
 12 years selling records by the mill, c'mon now 
 (P. Diddy) 
 Let's work (huh yeah), let's work 
 Let's work (huh yeah), let's work 
 Show me your soul! c'mon now!

34,Pharrell Williams,pop,The Game Has Changed,"I know, I disappeared and popped up in paris making chairs with a beard 
 And those that love me probably thought that it was weird 
 While the haters was happy, they thought my destiny was cleared 
 And any artist that you love have veered 
 Especially when they hated the image that they mirrored 
 I got a text that said ""p, please get up"" 
 Some light shining brightly outlining my shit up 
 The penthouses, the homes, the cars, the chains 
 The stones, the admirers, mini-me's and clones 
 Selling you n-ggas dreams that are boxes full of foam 
 In and out of dimensions I walk through walls 
 Just saying you can't put me in a box, that's all 
 No davinci codes and twilight stubs 
 Don't take this wrong, but I'll let you taste the blood 
 So fitting, the sound in my system, makes me want to squish them 
 King kong foot, the beast has awakened 
 The pro tools taping, my position blatant 
 You knew I was coming, choiceless, you waiting 
 Now I look up and ask why you've been for Satan 
 I shall hover for splendid covers 
 That alone makes me other, plus the return of the jedi 
 I study how the brooklyn machine works 
 That's word to big and his dead eye 
 I rise to the top like the sun 
 I rise to the pocket like a gun 
 I fire, drop ya body then it's done 
 They like, what happened, we trapped him 
 Hatred is obliverated when I imagine 
 Look at you drowning in ya lungs, gasping 
 Blood on the dancefloor, he, he michael jackson 
 Bitches should stay home they do so much cummin' 
 Y'all should stand backwards you do so much frontin' 
 Take this sun block we got too much sunning 
 Now lets examine what you thinking, running 
 Run too hard, you might tear ya meniscus 
 And if you try to run up you only get ya wig split 
 And this campaign that we runnning is viscious 
 I hate to eat and run but this was delicious"
35,Pharrell Williams,pop,The Problem (Lawwwddd),"The moment when you see that nigga face again 
 Replay it in your mind then your breathing change 
 He's reaching in his jacket, he gone make it rain 
 The bystanders screaming lawwwdd 
 The DJ screaming lawwwdd 
 The AK screaming lawwwdd 
 That's the nigga mama hard 
 Her baby stretched out on the boulevard 
 Niggas trying to shit on me and make history 
 Supposedly I help chicks, help them with groceries 
 Supposedly I still break, gripping my rosary 
 Still shoot ya block up then make you notice me 
 (Lawwwdd) Bullets flyin in the air much 
 Fuckin' gheard the guy hurt, I don't even care much 
 (Lawwwdd) And I'm still smoking bogomill 
 Still have the street meeting, stop one broker deals 
 You my nigga nigga fuck how nigga Oprah feels 
 Papi, I pop guns, they don't pop me 
 Known shooting niggas, but nah, they never shot me 
 Hang hang good bell gang, don't make us pop three 
 Yeah, I hear you talking what year, nigga whatever nigga 
 You did time, me too nigga, whatever nigga 
 Pussy plus dick could only equal to fuck 
 NORE + Pharrell could only equal to what what what what 
 From blood money to love money and thug money 
 Nino what up? Fucking the oldest G's money 
 I've shot niggas in they motherfucking peep holes 
 Winter time, shot niggas in they ski clothes 
 (Lawwwdd) still I stay focused still 
 Catch cases, got cases is open still

 Good bell gang hang hang, nigga ride out 
 Neptune, cocker spaniel, underground?

 Yeah I'ma skater, yeah I'm dirty 
 Lookin' for my wife, while they smart and perty 
 Your material-listic, journey 
 That bullshit, don't concern me 
 Ah, here you go, talking big shit 
 You ain't think, I could flip it like this quick 
 You just talking, and I'm the big shit 
 Without mentioning my hit list, for instance 
 Color dunk show, got 'em all yo 
 Got a different car, under each garage do' 
 From the Rolls Royce, that rides like hydro 
 That white 550, nigga, kicking like Tae Bo 
 I don't give a fuck, what ya haters think 
 Fam' I did things, my major means 
 At a pretty young age, I did major things 
 I made major cream, I eat major greens 
 First the yellow diamonds nigga, made ya bling 
 Had the baddest bitches, on the major scene 
 Fuck what ya heard and what you think you seen 
 I fuck that bitch who come from Cover Girl, to Maybelline 
 Quater million jewelry from, Las Van Dome 
 Diamonds and plat', like glass and chrome 
 Black credit card, just asking on 
 Didn't need it, just didn't have it home 
 White girl in Africa, Black in Rome 
 Philipina girl, just packing at home 
 All the girls I get, I hack and moan 
 Man I give 'em the dick, you know them bitches just gone 
 Nigga raise ya funds, been crazier son 
 But nigga ignorant, and Star Trak, take his fun 
 I'm the keyboard killer, with the raz-or toungue 
 Don't come back tellin' me, what play-ers done 
 I did it big, and I made it fun 
 I made a ton, oh yeah the Rolls Royce got sacadelic flowers 
 Painted on it, and I'm leaning on a nigga wit a lazor gun 
 The house in Virginia, that's what I'm living in 
 Building in Caribbean, fillin 'em and buildin' 'em 
 ""Paris too?"" said the strangest girl 
 I said bitch, I'm tryna change the world, whoo 
 (Verse 2 - Rohff)

 Qu'on écoute au car-pla, que les keufs ne blairent pas 
 Pour Sarko on est bon qu'à porter la cagoule et les gants 
 Star-co dans les mariages on est les plus élégants 
 Charme du ghetto, sur les photos 
 Joue les pachs, J'serre des tis-més (???) 
 Roule en Smart, J'raconte que d'la merde 
 Elle s'marre, font des smacks 
 On aime celles qui se respectent, car l'respect commence par soit même 
 Celles qui s'prennent pas la tête, qui couchent le soir même 
 On est bizarres, ma vie un bazar

 Les MCs j'smoke, le rap c'est comme 
 La prostitution, ça s'mac, Dan's l'show buis' 
 Font tous la bise, S'appellent "" chéri"" 
 On vient tout niquer sur l'terrain, la France-Algérie 
 Ton boss Rohff dans la place, protège ta garce 
 Reconnaît le flow, la classe de celle qui fracasse 
 Sur un gros son ""Neptunes"" issu de l'espace 
 Issu du bitume, donne moi mes tunes, j'suis un rapace 
 Partout où on passe, C'est d'la casse, L'air ne repousse pas 
 Ceux qui jactent dans les s'ringues ou crosses des lance-bas 
 A bout portant, on shoot la concurrence 
 T'entend pas l'ambulance, pam-pam-pam
