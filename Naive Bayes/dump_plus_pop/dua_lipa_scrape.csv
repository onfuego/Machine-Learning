0,Dua Lipa,pop,Genesis,"In the beginning 
 God created heaven and Earth 
 But for what it's worth 
 I think that he might've created you first 
 Just my opinion

 That I wanna fly to 
 Every day 
 And every night 
 I been sick and tired or runnin' 
 Chasin' all of the flashin' lights 
 These late nights don't mean nothing 
 So I just wanna apologise 
 I'm sorry 
 So sorry! 
 I'm sorry! 
 Yeah 
 I need your love 
 And I'm dying for the rush 
 'Cause my heart ain't got enough 
 I need your touch 
 This is gettin' serious 
 Tell me that it's not the end of us 
 How can we go back to the beginning? 
 How can we go back to the beginning? 
 Without you I've got no air to breathe in 
 How can we go back to the beginning? 
 Don't matter what's written 
 We can start all over again 
 All over again 
 No, how can I get you all over my skin? 
 My deep intuition 
 Tells me that I'm doin' you wrong 
 If I don't come home 
 Just say you forgive me and don't let me go 
 I been sick and tired or runnin' 
 Chasin' all of the flashin' lights 
 These late nights don't mean nothing 
 So I just wanna apologise 
 I'm sorry

 How can we go back to the beginning? 
 Without you, I've got no air to breathe in 
 How can we go back to the beginning? 
 You know, I roar like a lion 
 For you, you know I'll be trying till the sun starts rising 
 I need your love and I'm dying for the rush 
 Cause my heart ain't got enough 
 I need your touch 
 This is getting serious 
 Tell me that it's not the end of us

1,Dua Lipa,pop,Lost In Your Light,"Over and over 
 Waves of frightening feelings

 Midnight, your eyes 
 Bitter wine, conversations 
 You and me, some money, babe 
 I don't need a paycheck (Don't need a paycheck) 
 One taste and I'm hooked on it 
 Don't laugh, I know you want it 
 I'm addicted to your light

 Can let me in your head 
 I'm not here to make you kneel 
 But it's praise that I'll get 
 You ain't gonna walk free boy 
 Not finished with you yet, no 
 Can you feel the warmth? Yeah 
 As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol

 When we go down right there 
 You make me feel right there 
 When you lay me down right there 
 We just make it right there 
 'Cause you're looking so right there 
 Baby you should touch me right there 
 You can take me right there 
 We can make it 
 Hot like hell 
 Does it burn when I'm not there?

 You have got me wrong 
 So I cut you off 
 I don't need your love 
 'Cause I already cried enough 
 I've been done 
 I've been movin' on since we said goodbye 
 I cut you off

 You say you're sorry 
 But it's too late now 
 So save it, get gone, shut up

 Well, boy, I don't give a fuck 
 I remember that weekend 
 When my best friend caught you creepin' 
 You blamed it all on the alcohol

 Play the victim and switch your position

 No, I don't give a damn

6,Dua Lipa,pop,Garden,"Remember when we swam in the ocean? 
 Now we know what's deep inside 
 Remember when we ran in the open? 
 Now we know what's in the wild 
 Used to think that this love was heaven sent 
 How did we get lost? Can't get back again 
 Tell me, is there light on the outside? 
 So are we leaving this garden of eden? 
 Are we leaving this garden of eden? 
 Used to walk around your apartment 
 With nothing, but a smile on me 
 But tonight, I'm so self conscious 
 Isn't it so clear to see? 
 Nothing's ever perfect in paradise 
 Don't know what it's worth till you pay the price 
 When you bite your tongue does it draw blood? 
 So are we leaving this garden of eden? 
 Are we leaving this garden of eden? 
 Now I know what I know 
 But it's hard to find the meaning 
 Where do we go? 
 'Cause we don't believe in this garden of eden 
 (Eden, eden, eden...) 
 This garden of eden 
 (Eden, eden, eden...) 
 I have cried for you, and I'll ride for you 
 I would die for you, would you do that for me? 
 Tell the truth, what you wanna do 
 Is it me and you? 
 Are you with me, honey? 
 I have cried for you, and I'll ride for you 
 I would die for you, would you do that for me? 
 Tell the truth, what you wanna do 
 Is it me and you? 
 Are you with me? 
 So are we leaving this garden of eden? 
 Are we leaving this garden of eden? 
 Now I know what I know 
 But it's hard to find the meaning 
 Where do we go?

 Remember when we ran in the open? 
 So are we leaving?

 Are we leaving?

7,Dua Lipa,pop,No Goodbyes,"Maybe one day I can see you 
 We can smile and wave, and it'll be okay 
 Maybe one day it'll be cool 
 We could just be friends without the complications that it brings 
 When we start saying things 
 Yeah, I hurt you, and you hurt me 
 Yeah, we did some things that we can never take back 
 And we tried hard just to fix it 
 But we broke it more 
 And so I guess some things are not meant to last 
 Is it too much to ask? 
 For tonight 
 Let's love like there's no goodbyes (no goodbyes) 
 Just for tonight 
 Pretend that it's all all right (all all right) 
 Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies? 
 Just for tonight 
 Let's love like there's no goodbyes (no goodbyes) 
 No goodbyes 
 No goodbyes 
 No goodbyes, eh 
 In a dark room 
 We don't have to see the light of truth between me and you 
 We can stay blind in the meantime 
 Let our bodies say what we can never seem to communicate 
 Even though it's too late 
 For tonight 
 Let's love like there's no goodbyes (no goodbyes) 
 Just for tonight 
 Pretend that it's all all right (all all right) 
 Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies? 
 Just for tonight 
 Let's love like there's no goodbyes (no goodbyes) 
 No goodbyes 
 No goodbyes 
 No goodbyes, eh 
 No goodbyes 
 No goodbyes 
 No goodbyes, eh 
 Maybe one day I'll see you 
 Just smile and wave and be okay 
 For tonight 
 Let's love like there's no goodbyes 
 Just for tonight 
 Pretend that it's all all right (all all right) 
 Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies? 
 Just for tonight

8,Dua Lipa,pop,Thinking 'Bout You,"3 AM and my neighbours hate me 
 Music blasting, shaking these walls 
 This time mary-jane won't save me 
 I've been working later 
 I've been drinking stronger 
 I've been smoking deeper 
 But the memories won't stop 
 I can't stop thinking 'bout you 
 I can't stop thinking 'bout you 
 I can't get high 
 I can't get by 
 I can't get through 
 I can't stop thinking 'bout you 
 Like poison coursing through me 
 So clear, my vision is blurred 
 The haze won't put my mind out it 
 I've been sleeping later 
 I've been breathing stronger 
 I've been digging deeper 
 But the memories won't stop 
 I can't stop thinking 'bout you 
 I can't stop thinking 'bout you 
 I can't get high 
 I can't get by 
 I can't get through 
 I can't stop thinking 'bout you 
 (I want you all) 
 Say it before you run outta time 
 (I want you all) 
 Say it before it's too late 
 (I want you all) 
 Say what I am feeling, oh 
 (I want you all) 
 Waiting is insane 
 I can't stop thinking 'bout you 
 I can't stop thinking 'bout you 
 I can't get high 
 I can't get by 
 I can't get through 
 I can't stop thinking 'bout you

 Are begging me to beg for you 
 Begging me to beg for your love 
 Losing my mind 
 Dreaming I'll find 
 Another kind of love 
 But this blood in my veins 
 And the thought of your taste 
 No, I can't give it up 
 So look at my face 
 Not running away 
 'Cause all my bones 
 Are begging me to beg for you 
 Begging me to beg for your love

 When the rain stops 
 Then, darling, what will I do 
 And I know I go all in 
 But why do I 
 You give me a reason 
 Something to believe in 
 I know, I know, I know 
 You give me a meaning 
 Something I can breathe in 
 I know, I know, I know 
 It's a bittersweet feeling 
 Longing and I'm leaving 
 I go, I go, I go 
 But I wish I was there with you 
 Oh, I wish I was there with you 
 There's a crack in my window 
 A bird in my room 
 Angels all over 
 That watch over you 
 When I'm walking on water 
 All my dreams have come true 
 Still, nothing means nothing 
 Without you, you 
 You give me a reason 
 Something to believe in 
 I know, I know, I know 
 You give me a meaning 
 Something I can breathe in 
 I know, I know, I know 
 It's a bittersweet feeling 
 Longing and I'm leaving 
 I go, I go, I go 
 Tell my heart to lie 
 But I know deep inside it's true

 Can I get it like that, that, that? Let me know

 And I know it's not real, but the way that I feel 
 I just need to know 
 Can I get it like that, that, that? Let me know

 Time is a-ticking, and we gotta leave town tonight 
 Can I get it like that, that, that? Let me know

 And I know it's not real, but the way that I feel 
 I just need to know (know, know, know)

13,Dua Lipa,pop,Room For 2,"Up and down, it all comes back around 
 Push and shove, do you feel better now? 
 Knock, knock, knock 
 You'll come tumblin' down 
 Karma's got a kiss for you 
 Why are you blaming me for all your insecurities? 
 I never did anything, but you closed the doors 
 Slammed shut on me 
 Something a little bit bitter that should've been sweet 
 I won't compete 
 You're like a king with a crown looking down 
 Hoping I want it 
 Up and down, it all comes back around 
 Push and shove, do you feel better now? 
 Knock, knock, knock 
 You'll come tumblin' down 
 Karma's got a kiss for you 
 Up and down, it all comes back around 
 Push and shove, do you feel better now? 
 Knock, knock, knock 
 You'll come tumblin' down 
 Karma's got a kiss for you 
 Remember what it felt like to start the climb 
 I'm just like you 
 Maybe you'll better with time and we'll leave it behind 
 There's room for 2 
 You should've never done something like that to someone 
 You can't undo 
 Thought you were under the radar 
 But under the chaos I see through 
 Up and down, it all comes back around 
 Push and shove, do you feel better now? 
 Knock, knock, knock 
 You'll come tumblin' down 
 Karma's got a kiss for you 
 Up and down, it all comes back around 
 Push and shove, do you feel better now? 
 Knock, knock, knock 
 You'll come tumblin' down 
 Karma's got a kiss for you 
 I hope that one day you will change 
 See, everyone ain't the same 
 We're more than machines 
 You saw a spark where there wasn't a flame 
 And you barely remember my name 
 Do you feel complete? 
 Up and down, it all comes back around 
 Push and shove, do you feel better now? 
 Knock, knock, knock 
 You'll come tumblin' down 
 Karma's got a kiss for you 
 Up and down, it all comes back around 
 Push and shove, do you feel better now? 
 Knock, knock, knock 
 You'll come tumblin' down 
 Karma's got a kiss for you"
14,Dua Lipa,pop,New Love,"Now it's getting quiet here 
 Now it's getting blue 
 And this baby ain't no fair 
 Taking up my youth 
 You've been telling me some lies 
 I've been thinking it's the truth 
 But I see it in your eyes 
 The things that you do 
 I don't wanna waste more time all alone 
 Want somewhere to go 
 Something to call my own 
 And I ain't satisfied 
 When you go 
 Outside of the road, washed up on the shore 
 And I've been through mountains and seas 
 Tryina get you to come back to me 
 And I've been far and I've been so deep 
 Now I find it harder, and harder to breathe 
 And I need some new love, new love, new love 
 Even though I found a way 
 I still come back 
 Know there's nothing more to say 
 It's all been said 
 I've been trying to explain 
 Nothing we hide 
 To all of my friends who say 
 That I've gone mad 
 I don't wanna waste more time all alone 
 Want somewhere to go 
 Something to call my own 
 And I ain't satisfied 
 When you go 
 Outside of the road, washed up on the shore 
 And I need some new love, new love, new love 
 Easy come, easy go, why? 
 I've been living on, living on 
 Living on, give it all, give it all 
 Can't I just let it go? 
 'Cause I wait for a miracle 
 I wait for a miracle, yeah! 
 And I've been through mountains and seas 
 Tryina get you to come back to me 
 And I've been far and I've been so deep 
 Now I find it harder, and harder to breathe 
 And I need some new love, new love, new love"

 You see that we got the same pain, same scar 
 Felt that when we got closer in the dark

 You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there 
 Let's be bad together, baby, you and I 
 Let's be bad together, if only for a while 
 Let's be bad together, make the devil smile 
 Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah 
 Nothing can stop us, we got it all 
 The love, the passion, but most of all 
 We mess up and run from the scene 
 When I throw my hands up, if you know what I mean 
 'Cause I'm not afraid to tell you when you're wrong 
 And I know that you miss me when I'm gone 
 We make a great team 
 With you, I'm better than I've ever been 
 Baby, when, when you're far away

 Yeah we might just end up crashin' 
 But I'm ready if it happens with you 
 Meet me out in Cali when I'm far away from family 
 And I need someone to hold onto 
 You're the only thing I know 
 And I don't wanna let this go 
 Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home 
 Can't wait till we're alone 
 We were built to last 
 We were built like that 
 Baby take my hand 
 Tighten this romance 
 We could burn and crash 
 We could take a chance 
 Holdin' nothing back 
 Like it's our last dance! 
 Like it's our last dance! 
 Like it's our last dance! 
 My eyes wide open, fallin' in and out of focus 
 Pressure flowin' like a river in my head 
 Crying you ain't with me and it's floodin' the whole city 
 While my soul's burning like a cigarette 
 You're the only thing I know 
 And I don't wanna let this go 
 Close to you are I feel, feel like I'm at home 
 Can't wait till we're alone 
 We were built to last 
 We were built like that 
 Baby take my hand 
 Tighten this romance 
 We could burn and crash 
 We could take a chance 
 Holdin' nothin' back

 Way too young to hurt so long 
 I'm hurtin' 
 Was it worth it? 
 Way too soon I feel so strong 
 Way too young to hurt so long

 Was it worth it?

17,Dua Lipa,pop,For Julian,"What would you do? 
 What would you do if I handed you a drug that would teach you something new? 
 What what you feel 
 How would you feel if I took over the fake and made them all real? 
 What would you say 
 What would you say if I told you it's actually gon' be a good day? 
 Maybe all things things happen for a reason 
 You just need to get over this dry season 
 But the only drug you need is believing 
 Maybe God does answer all your prayers 
 Maybe you need to let go of the fear 
 Of being let down from the people you keep near 
 Maybe it's because you're running low on gear 
 Maybe God does answer all your prayers 
 What do you need? 
 What do you need to show you there's better things in life than good weed? 
 What do you hear? 
 What do you hear? 
 What do you hear when I tell you I'm always near? 
 I made it pretty clear 
 What do you see? 
 What do you see when you find out the best things in life are all free? 
 You got a friend in me 
 Maybe all things things happen for a reason 
 You just need to get over this dry season 
 But the only drug you need is believing 
 Maybe God does answer all your prayers 
 Maybe you need to let go of the fear 
 Of being let down from the people you keep near 
 Maybe it's because you're running low on gear 
 Maybe God does answer all your prayers 
 And I'm still here 
 And I'm holding hard onto your hand 
 But it still feels 
 Like you're never gonna understand 
 One can drown alone but we can swim together 
 Maybe all things happen for a reason 
 You just need to get over this dry season 
 But the only drug you need is believing 
 Maybe God does answer all your prayers 
 And let go of the fear 
 Of being let down from the people you keep near 
 Is it because you're running low on gear? 
 Maybe God does answer all your prayers"
18,Dua Lipa,pop,Bang Bang,"I was five, and he was six 
 We rode on horses made of sticks 
 He wore black, and I wore white 
 He would always win the fight 
 Bang bang 
 He shot me down 
 Bang bang 
 I hit the ground 
 Bang bang 
 That awful sound 
 Bang bang 
 My baby shot me down 
 Seasons came and changed the time 
 When I grew up, I called him mine 
 He would always laugh and say 
 ""Remember when we used to play"" 
 Bang bang 
 I shot you down 
 Bang bang 
 You hit the ground 
 Bang bang 
 That awful sound 
 Bang bang 
 I used to shoot you down 
 Music played and people sang 
 Just for me the church bells rang 
 Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
 Now he's gone, I don't know why 
 And 'til this day, I sometimes cry 
 He didn't even say goodbye 
 He didn't take the time to lie 
 Bang bang 
 He shot me down 
 Bang bang 
 I hit the ground 
 Bang bang 
 That awful sound 
 Bang bang

 You can't hear silence up to this lung 
 You can't tie heartstrings when they're left undone 
 You can't go back when you've left too long 
 I try to push us to the very end 
 I needed a lover more than a friend 
 But I hit the limit I didn't intend 
 And I just wanna make amends 
 Wish that you would hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on to me 
 Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on to me 
 Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on to me now, yeah 
 I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak 
 And now I'm staring at the emptiness that I've made 
 I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak 
 And all I wanted was you but I shot love down, down, down 
 Down, down, down, down 
 In the darkness I hear your voice 
 Memories of us I feel destroyed 
 My mind is playing tricks and I have no choice 
 Without you my heart makes no noise 
 Wish that you would hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on to me 
 Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on to me 
 Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on to me now, yeah 
 I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak 
 And now I'm staring at the emptiness that I've made 
 I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak 
 And all I wanted was you but I shot love down, down, down 
 Down, down, down, down 
 All I needed was you 
 All I wanted was you 
 All I needed was you 
 I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak 
 And now I'm staring at the emptiness that I've made

 I need you to keep me safe from lions and tigers and bears"

 Oh, say you will be mine 
 Say you will be mine 
 I wanna be yours (Hey) 
 I wanna be everything you ever dreamed of 
 I wanna be yours 
 Are you looking at anybody else because 
 I wanna be yo-o-o-o-o-o-ours 
 (I wanna be) yo-o-o-o-o-o-ours 
 (I wanna wanna be) yo-o-o-o-o-o-ours 
 I wanna be yours"
27,Dua Lipa,pop,Rollin' / Did You See?,"I've been rollin' on the freeway 
 I've been riding 85 
 I've been thinking way too much 
 And I'm way too gone to drive 
 I've got anger in my chest 
 I've got millions on my mind 
 And you didn't fit the picture 
 So I guess you weren't the vibe 
 I've been rollin' on the freeway 
 I've been riding 85 
 I've been thinking way too much 
 And I'm way too gone to drive 
 I've got anger in my chest 
 I've got millions on my mind 
 And you didn't fit the picture 
 So I guess you weren't the vibe 
 Did you see what I done? 
 Came in a black Benz, left in a white one 
 I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam 
 My gallies wanna try some 
 Did you see what I done? 
 Came in a black Benz, left in a white one 
 I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam 
 My gallies wanna try some 
 Came here just to sing for Clara 
 Lookin' for the baddest diva 
 Hol' up, let me analyse her, body lookin' like a hypnotiser 
 Come let me try some, suttin' you can climb on 
 Oh, you're a shy one, who you tryna hide from? 
 Baby, jump in the black ride and put your friend in the white one 
 I'm a Benzo addict, pulled up in traffic 
 Me and my friends switched cars and it looked like magic 
 They never seen such a skinny man in a big puffer jacket 
 That's unfamiliar, I came lookin' like a bodybuilder 
 Out here's windy, yana, you're the one that I'm into, yana 
 Don't you wanna see the interior? 
 Did you see what I done? 
 Came in a black Benz, left in a white one 
 I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam 
 My gallies wanna try some 
 Did you see what I done? 
 Came in a black Benz, left in a white one 
 I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam 
 My gallies wanna try some, oh hey 
 I've been rollin' on the freeway 
 I've been riding 85 
 I've been thinking way too much 
 And I'm way too gone to drive 
 I've got anger in my chest 
 I've got millions on my mind 
 And you didn't fit the picture 
 So I guess you weren't the vibe, hey 
 Did you see what I done? 
 Came in a black Benz, left in a white one 
 I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam 
 My gallies wanna try some 
 Did you see what I done? 
 Came in a black Benz, left in a white one 
 I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam 
 My gallies wanna try some"
28,Dua Lipa,pop,Cruel,"Cab radio screaming 
 Noise and tears 
 Death on the TV 
 And then there's you 
 Messed up, it's crazy 
 I can't concentrate 
 I just see your outline... 
 Mhmm 
 Back where we left off 
 Watch you take your dress off 
 I've been by myself remembering you 
 Your body hurts me 
 Loopin' 'round like CCTV 
 In all this bitterness, you stay so sweet 
 Such a cruel world 
 Savin' all my love for you, girl 
 Uh, it's such a cruel world 
 Maybe I found somethin' good, girl 
 Uh-uh-uh-uh 
 Some prick at the party 
 All scripts and boasts 
 A dead eyed actress girl 
 And then there's you 
 Venus in Converse 
 You put a spell on me 
 And you're lockin' up the bathroom door for us 
 Back where we left off 
 Watch you take your dress off 
 I've been by myself remembering you 
 Your body hurts me 
 Loopin' 'round like CCTV 
 In all this bitterness, you stay so sweet 
 Such a cruel world 
 Savin' all my love for you, girl 
 Uh, it's such a cruel world 
 Maybe I found somethin' good, girl 
 It's such a cruel world 
 Hey, hey, hey 
 It's such a cruel world 
 Hey, hey, hey 
 Sunrise in Hollywood 
 We ain't slept for days 
 Perfect disaster 
 Me and you 
 Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
 It's such a cruel world 
 Savin' all my love for you, girl 
 Uh, it's such a cruel world 
 Maybe I found somethin' good, girl 
 It's such a cruel world 
 Savin' all my love for you, girl 
 It's such a cruel world 
 Maybe I found somethin' good, girl 
 Uh-uh-uh-uh 
 Sunrise in Hollywood 
 We ain't slept for days"
