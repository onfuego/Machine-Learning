 I'm going nowhere, but I'm guaranteed to be late 
 You go out like a riptide 
 You know that ball has no sides 
 You're an angel with an amber halo 
 Black hair, and the devil's pitchfork 
 Wind-up anger with the endless view of 
 The ground's colorful patchwork 
 How have you been, how have you been? 
 How have you, how have you? 
 I drove around for hours, I drove around for days 
 I drove around for months and years, and never went no place 
 We're on a pass, we're on pass, I stopped for gas, but where could place be 
 To pay for gas to drive around, around on Interstate 8 
 You go out like a riptide 
 You know that ball has no sides 
 You're an angel with an amber halo 
 Black hair, and the devil's pitchfork 
 Wind-up anger with the endless view of 
 The ground's colorful patchwork

 How have you, how have you?"

 I'm just sitting down, thinking about nothing 
 Looking at the thin air, breathing up the oxygen 
 Have I told ya, have I told ya? 
 You could really get it on, you could really get it on 
 A guy comes up, looking pretty 8-ball 
 Snaggletooth smile, sits down at my table 
 Puts his arm around me, starts to share his information 
 He said, he said, he said, he said, he said, this is what he said 
 I have sex, I'm always thinking about the pavement 
 So I can avoid premature ejaculation 
 I got up, remembering to thank him 
 Better things to do so I'll start drinking

 Backlogged books on the seven wonders 
 We're all so funny but it's lost it's charm now 
 All communications end in one line jokes 
 From stand up comics and rock musicians 
 Making so much noise you don't know when to listen 
 Why are you judging people so damn hard 
 You're taking your point of views a bit too far 
 I made my shoes shine with that coal 
 But the polish didn't shine the hole 
 If you stand in a circle 
 Then you'll all have a back to bite 
 Backlogged books on the seven wonders

 It's moving back to the sea 
 Plan to hitch a ride with the river

 I got wood legs and bow legs, and no legs at all 
 Damn, would you take a collect call? 
 Oh no, I don't understand 
 I got poor eyes and sore eyes, and no eyes at all 
 Damn, would you like to take the fall? 
 Oh no, I don't like this plan 
 It was a staple of brass tacks and wax backs 
 Oh yeah, a message left on the forehead of God 
 Sent sealed and signed by the saints 
 Who sang this song, this song 
 This song

 We'll buy the congregation 
 Then one day, you'll find us sitting in your chair

 That got them jobs 
 Featherweight fathers know nothing 'bout daughters 
 And sons be damned 
 The rest of the buttons are pushing themselves to an early grave 
 Parcels means presents means visits means pleaure so 
 We all got jobs 
 Blindspot opinions reach millions of readers and 
 They pass their thoughts 
 My fear of grown-ups confirmed 
 When dealing with folks like managers 
 And the sad minds unwind 
 And are given to thoughts of happiness 
 And the broke heart's [...] 
 And I'm given to thoughts of happiness"

 Then I'll tell you 
 TV stained my memories 
 Yeah, I don't fit the shoes 
 Remember through sounds, remember through smells 
 Remember through colors, remember through towns 
 With fear and fascination on what was here 
 And what's replacing them now 
 Interchange plazas, and malls, and crowded chain restaurants 
 More housing developments go up named after the things they replace 
 So welcome to Meadow Brook and welcome to Shady Space 
 Well, it all seems a little abrupt, well no, I don't like this change of pace"

 Pulled the scabs off of regrets 
 We haven't learned to eat our conscience yet 
 Truly sorry, I see clearly

 When I finally get it figured out, I've changed the whole damn plan 
 Oh, noose 
 Tied myself in, tied myself too tight 
 Oh, noose

 You move your mouth and you start to talk 
 You close your eyes and then lose the thought 
 What's mine is mine and what's yours you probably got, and we all fall 
 On the way down they saw a lot they don't remember 
 And if you asked them how, they'd say that gravity's how they got there

 Everything will fall right into place 
 When we die, some sink and some lay 
 But at least I don't see you float away 
 And all the spilt milk, sex and weight 
 It all will fall, fall right into place

 I like the autumn, but this place is getting old 
 I pack up my belongings and I head for the coast 
 It might not be a lot, but I feel like I'm making the most 
 The days get longer and the nights smell green 
 I guess it's not surprising, but it's spring and I should leave 
 I like songs about drifters, books about the same 
 They both seem to make me feel a little less insane 
 Walked on off onto another spot 
 I still haven't gotten anywhere that I want 
 Did I want love, did I need to know? 
 Why does it always feel like I'm caught in an undertow? 
 Moths beat themselves to death against the lights 
 Adding their breeze to the summer nights 
 Outside, water like air was grey 
 I didn't know what I had that day 
 Walk a little farther to another plan 
 You said that you did, but you didn't understand 
 I know that starting over's not what life's about 
 But my thoughts were so loud I couldn't hear my mouth 
 My thoughts were so loud I couldn't hear my mouth 
 My thoughts were so loud"

 It was worth it just to learn some sleight of hand 
 Bad news comes, don't you worry, even when it lands 
 Good news will work its way to all them plans 
 We both got fired on exactly the same day 
 Well, we'll float on, good news is on the way

 I assume as much for other people 
 Oh, and I know this of myself 
 We've listened more to life's end gong 
 Than the sound of life's sweet bells 
 Was it ever worth it, was there all that much to gain? 
 Well, we knew we missed the boat and we'd already missed the plane 
 And we didn't read the invite, we just danced at our own wake 
 All our favorites were playing so we could shake, shake, shake, shake, shake 
 Tiny curtains open and we heard the tiny clap of little hands 
 A tiny man would tell a little joke and get a tiny laugh from all the folks 
 Sitting drifting around in bubbles and thinking it was us that carried them 
 When we finally got it figured out that we had truly missed the boat

 Bag of splinters boiling over, on your back expose your belly 
 Optimism doesn't change the facts, just what you're gonna see 
 Like it was stated that we're walking salt and coal 
 Plants solidify sunshine, how'd this start, I don't know 
 Causing feet and entire chain shoe stores 
 The sun's diary pulled up from deep canary holes 
 And when we read it, our skin, it becomes warm 
 At the movies, eyes iced over, walking sideways, through the gutter 
 And you realize life sticks to your feet, your history 
 I'm gonna slap that look off your face like life don't hold no mystery 
 All those red marks on our shoulders Self back patting, homemade trophies 
 Well the past only exists as tiny bricks we burn to release all it's memory 
 I've had enough with rolling boulders, I want more moss on me 
 Clocks to splinters but time goes forward 
 And when them trees drop leaves your feet collect their memories 
 I guess all us snakes find our tails pretty damn tasty! 
 I heard you mention we're walking salt and coal 
 Plants solidify sunshine, how'd it start, I don't know 
 Causing feet and entire chain shoe stores

 Based on the books and clothes on your floor

 He said that this should do the trick 
 We hadn't told him what the problem was yet

 But don't everyone go 
 Don't everyone go at once

 Soft sticky cold we arrive and then start to cry 
 All those insects that I sent are trapped in my window once again 
 Empty their pockets out and I'll sort it at the table 
 Line up then shoo 'em off 
 Sure as hell they'll all get caught 
 In our window pockets full as they are able 
 The signs all flicker and buzz all night 
 Passing by you could hear them say 
 ""Hey, please won't you just come on in."" 
 ""Won't you please just go away.""

147,Modest Mouse,rock,The Tortoise And The Tourist,"Wake up, get ready 
 Wake up, get ready 
 What a wonderful trip's ahead 
 Well, wake up, get ready 
 Wake up, get ready 
 Such a wonderful trip's ahead 
 We get dressed as ghosts 
 With sheets taken from the bed 
 Inside our socks, we hide travelers' checks 
 We are tourists of the dead 
 So let's pack up 
 Let's go 
 So let's pack up 
 Let's go 
 Let's pack up 
 Let's go 
 Let's go 
 There was this tortoise 
 Its shell was covered with jewels 
 And had been since time began 
 It knew the world through all its histories 
 And the universe and its mysteries 
 One day it came across a man 
 The two were talking 
 The tortoise offered to tell him 
 About the future and how the universe ran 
 Oh, the man killed the tortoise, took his shell 
 And with a song on his lips, walked off again 
 So let's walk off 
 Let's go 
 So let's walk off 
 Let's go 
 Let's walk off 
 Let's go 
 So let's walk off 
 Let's go 
 Pack a lunch, wander 'round 
 Toss the map on the ground 
 It isn't accurate anyways 
 We've been getting away 
 We've been getting away 
 We are strangers to ourselves 
 We sneak out 
 Drip by drip 
 Through paper cuts on our hands 
 Day after day 
 Nothing's quite the same 
 We are tourists in our own heads 
 So let's walk on 
 Let's go 
 Let's walk on 
 Let's go 
 Let's walk on 
 (I think I feel ready to go) 
 Let's go 
 Let's walk on 
 Let's go 
 (I think I feel ready to go) 
 (I think I feel ready to go) 
 (I think I feel ready to go) 
 (I think I feel ready to go) 
 (I think I feel ready to go) 
 (I think I feel ready to go) 
 (I think I feel ready to go)

148,Modest Mouse,rock,The Best Room,"Let loose with your charms 
 Go reckless, unharmed 
 We all signed the card 
 Get well but don't you try too hard 
 The lesson's unlearned 
 Oh this meeting, it's adjourned 
 Oh these western concerns 
 Hold my place in line while I take your turn 
 To the empty balconies we serenade 
 All the playgrounds where them kids don't get to play 
 Dirty parkies went and chased them all away 
 To the game consoles to fatten 
 The best room they have 
 Is the last room you want 
 The bathroom's outside 
 Police tape is tied 
 To the doorknobs from rooms 
 Nine through thirty-two 
 These western concerns 
 We beg while we chew 
 These western concerns are all I ever really learned 
 To be concerned with 
 But don't you, don't you know 
 It's hard feeling tired every time that you try 
 Ain't it hard feeling tired all the time? 
 The family living upstairs must have a fleet of riding lawnmowers 
 Well the novelist to my right's convinced that every woman's a whore 
 But he bothers me time and again to set him up with my very best friends 
 And I say what? Says he doesn't restate but he will not shut up 
 Well don't you, don't you know 
 It's hard feeling tired every time that you try 
 Ain't it hard feeling tired all the time? 
 Well don't you, don't you know 
 I'm gonna bury my head in the woods right now 
 Scan for some mycelium 
 Bring a little back to town 
 Well don't you, don't you know it's hard (I ain't goin' to bed) 
 Feeling tired every time that you try? (Ring my head in the woods right now) 
 Ain't it hard feeling tired all the time?(Scan for some mycelium and bring a little back to town) 
 Go reckless, unharmed 
 Yep, the shut-ins, they're well armed 
 Well we all led the charge 
 'Til we ran aground in our party barge 
 Every little gift was just one more part of their grift 
 Oh yeah we know it, oh yeah we know it 
 Best news that we got was some dumb hokum we'd bought 
 Going reckless feeling great 
 We're the sexiest of all primates 
 Let's let loose with our charms 
 Shake our ass and wave our arms 
 All going apeshit"
149,Modest Mouse,rock,Of Course We Know,"The streets are just blankets 
 And we sleep on their silky corpse, ahh 
 Covered up by them, why would we ever want to wake up? 
 Oh, no 
 Well, of course, of course, of course, of course 
 Of course we just do not know, ahh 
 What in hell are we here for? 
 We just do not know, ahh 
 Lord lay down, Lord lay down, Lord lay down 
 Your own damn soul, ahh 
 Lord lay down, Lord lay down, Lord lay down 
 Your own damn soul, ahh 
 Lord lay down, Lord lay down, Lord lay down 
 Your own damn soul 
 The end is like cotton that we wear 
 Wherever we go, ahh 
 Covered up by this, why would we ever want to try on your clothes? 
 Ahh 
 Well of course, of course, of course, of course 
 Of course we just do not know, ahh 
 Well, Lord lay down, Lord lay down, Lord lay down 
 Let down your guard 
 Lord lay down, Lord lay down, Lord lay down 
 Your own damn soul, ahh 
 Lord lay down, Lord lay down, Lord lay down 
 Your only son, oh 
 Of course we know, ahh"

151,Modest Mouse,rock,Four Leaf Clover,"Got an open mouth and open sores too 
 Got an oversized opinion of you 
 Got a long race and no chance to lose 
 Got an oversized opinion for two 
 Got an open mouth and open sores too 
 Got an indifferent opinion of you 
 Got an open mouth and nothin' to lose 
 Got an oversized opinion of you 
 Yeah, I'm down 
 I'm picking incense off the ground 
 Yeah, I'm down 
 Got one got twenty got ten and I said, I'll kill y'know 
 This isn't over, I've got a four leaf clover 
 Got one got twenty got ten and I said, I'll kill y'know 
 This isn't over, I've got a four leaf clover 
 Got one got twenty got ten and I said, I'll kill y'know

152,Modest Mouse,rock,Too Many Fiestas For Rueben,"He's 25, hanging out at the high school 
 Everyone but the butt-rockers knows that ain't cool 
 Got a teen girlfriend and a little mustache 
 He's got ol' AC/DC coming out of his dash 
 He's got himself a black Trans Am 
 Well they build 'em much smaller over there in Japan 
 Beep, beep, beep on Monday 
 Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep on Tuesday 
 Too many fiestas for Reuben 
 Yeah he got drunk and he went cruising 
 That boy is shot 
 Two gallons of tequila is what he got 
 ... 
 Beep, beep, beep on Wednesday 
 Beep, beep, beep on Thursday 
 Beep, beep, beep on Friday 
 Saturday and Sunday are his days off"
153,Modest Mouse,rock,"White Lies, Yellow Teeth","You went out for a walk 
 I'm sure you went a long ways 
 Sorting things out in our heads 
 We'll forget in a few days 
 In the place before you're made 
 They give you all these options 
 Like if you've got wings 
 Or have you got feelings 
 Or can you breathe underwater? 
 He chose lifting ten times his weight 
 And natural body armor 
 And then on the day his mother gave 
 He came out as an insect 
 People talk in soda pop 
 They talk it quite a lot 
 The opinions that I don't give 
 Are the opinions I don't got 
 White lies fall off my yellow teeth, 
 I didn't convince you but I believed 
 White lies fall off my yellow teeth 
 I didn't convince you but I believed 
 White lies fall off my yellow teeth 
 I didn't convince you but I believed 
 All so plain it's all a plan 
 It's all so true of everyone 
 The sky does not ever end 
 The air just gets much thinner 
 I knew a man who went on and on 
 About how he knew a man who knew a man 
 Who knew a man who knew him once 
 You can keep digging down and down inside 
 And even turn around or find in hell 
 You're digging up again 
 Some hippie told me, ""Free your pets"" 
 So I let them all go free 
 It didn't take no time at all 
 For them to run on back to me"
