 But we bet you've never heard it with such a vicious rhyme 
 A rhyme with class and plenty of clout 
 To show you sucher M.C.'s what it's about 
 We hear the same stories everywhere we go 
 Hey, it's Nynuk who stole the show 
 So for all you party people who are in a state of shock 
 We're The New Kids On The Block! 
 Chillin' on the corner, the first day we arrived 
 From the looks of the hoods, we didn't think we'd survive 
 Second day we were there, we were walking down the street 
 With a rhyme in mind and a funky beat 
 But when we turned into the alley, to our surprise 
 We saw a bunch of hoods right before our eyes 
 They looked us up and down once, twice and again 
 There must have been a hundred to a hundred and ten 
 So, I looked over my shoulder right at my friend 
 He said 'Nice knowing you' but this is the end 
 So we battened down the hatches and prepared to fight 
 Then all of a sudden I seen the light 
 The time was right, the time to rock 
 'Cause everybody knows, we're The New Kids On The Block. 
 We're also devastating when we're on stage 
 The fans start screaming and yelling with rage 
 With mic's in hand and rhymes with clout 
 So watch it sucker MCs or we're gonna turn you out 
 We never talk trash, our rhymes are clean 
 Our rhymes are never vague and we say nothing obscene 
 So any sucker MCs who wanna battle us 
 Can you go at least 20 lines without a cuss? 
 Cause once we start to jam, you'll be in a state of shock 
 Clear the way party people, we're The New Kids On The Block 
 Move it sucker MCs or you're gonna feel the wrath 
 So don't get caught up in the aftermath 
 'Cause we're the funky MCs of the hip hop craze 
 Our rhymes are done by law and are sure to amaze 
 With a DJ cutting records, steady cross bass 
 We'll leave all you party people stuck in a daze 
 I say we're fresh, new and you know it's true 
 Now let me introduce you to the rest of the crew 
 J, he's fresh. He's the master of mix 
 There ain't no rhyme that he can't fix 
 Spinster's next, he's the king of the spin 
 And if you wanna battle, you ain't gonna win 
 Then there's Popeye, but we call him Joey 
 The kid's so fresh, you'll never be bored 
 Next is jon, whose word is true 
 But the party people know him as the runner GQ 
 I'm Dexter P. the wizard of word 
 I'm the greatest MC that you've ever heard 
 Now that you know we're a gang and you know we don't play 
 We're The New Kids On The Block and we're here to stay

 In the candlelight 
 Still shines so brightly

 Come have a seat 
 Sit by the fireplace and 
 I'll massage your shoulders if they hurt 
 I can tell by your eyes, a hard day at work 
 God's gift to man 
 Though some might say that 
 We're too young to understand 
 But I've got a firm grip on reality 
 And you and me is right where I wanna be... 
 Wrapped in your arms 
 And you in mine 
 A love like this is really hard to find 
 So I won't front and try to play love games 
 I'll always be the same, won't a damn thing change 
 You hear me talking? 
 Trust what I'm about--love and understanding 
 Won't play each other out 
 You got a feeling that I'm doing you low? 
 Girl it's not so 
 I'll never let you go"

 Get back what we lost 
 I see shadows of a doubt 
 But I'm keepin' my fingers crossed 
 She was just turning seventeen 
 He always promised her he'd stay 
 They were so love crazy 'til she had a baby 
 Then he turned and walked away 
 How long will we keep this goin' on 
 Before we find a way to care for each other 
 Living for today 
 We'll never see tomorrow 
 We gotta work it out 
 Get back what we lost 
 I see shadows of a doubt 
 But I'm keepin' my fingers crossed 
 He was just out to get a wreck 
 He was too proud to show his pain 
 Someone pulled a trigger 
 Guess he never figured he would lose at his own game 
 How long can we keep this goin' on 
 When no one takes the blame 
 There's so many gone 
 We could find a way, it may not be too late 
 We gotta work it out 
 Get back what we lost 
 I see shadows of a doubt 
 But I'm keepin' my fingers crossed 
 Take a look around 
 See how hard it is to survive these days 
 But sometimes you wonder 
 How long can this keep goin' on 
 I guess the only thing you do is keep your fingers crossed 
 How long will we keep this goin' on 
 When no one takes the blame 
 There's so many gone 
 Livin' for today, we may not see tomorrow 
 We gotta work it out 
 Get back what we lost

 Can't do nothing at all 
 Everywhere I walk, nowhere to turn

 Crying every day 
 I was givin' up and you walked into my life 
 I never knew anything about love 
 In the world that I know 
 Lovers come and go 
 Nobody anywhere, talk like you do 
 Saying dreams can come true 
 Then you made me feel just like a man should feel 
 Ever since you walked into my life 
 All at once, I feel so strong inside 
 Anything you ask of me 
 I'll do it faithfully 
 Since you walked into my life (into my life) 
 Yeah, girl 
 You're the only one for me 
 Oh, girl 
 Oh baby (oh baby) 
 Now I've got a reason to live 
 And oh darling 
 How I love the sweet love you give (oh baby) 
 And I wanna spend my life with you 
 Wanna make your dreams come true 
 Every step you take I wanna be with you 
 I am learning that the touch of love is magic 
 Feel it once, and you will see your world so differently 
 Nothing stays the way that it was 
 Everything begins again 
 You're not who you've always been 
 Ever since you came into my life 
 I wanna be with you, girl 
 Since you walked into 
 Since you walked into my life

 Do you remember? 
 Or should I rewind? 
 To that summer when you caught my eye? 
 I played it cool 
 The weather was hot 
 You had the beauty and the beach on lock. 
 With your flip flops, half shirt, short shorts, mini skirt 
 Walkin' on the beach, so pretty 
 You wasn't lookin' for a man 
 When you saw me in the sand 
 But you fell for the boy from the city. 
 I was like ""Hey, girl, can I get your number?"" 
 I remember what you told me too 
 ""Don't call after 10:00"" 
 But you know that I did 
 'Cause I couldn't stop thinkin' 'about you. 
 I think about you in the Summertime. 
 Oh oh. 
 And all the good times we had, baby 
 Been a few years & I can't deny.

 I think about you in the Summertime. 
 Oh oh. 
 I'm sittin' here in the sun with you on my mind. 
 You're my... my Summertime. 
 Do you remember? 
 I'll never forget 
 Touchin' your body all soakin' wet 
 The water was cool 
 The feelin' was hot 
 Kissin' on you while the ocean rocked. 
 In your strapless sundress 
 Kickin' back, no stress 
 As long as we was together 
 'Cause we were feelin' young love 
 And we couldn't get enough. 
 Baby, I could reminisce forever. 
 And now I'm like 
 Hey, girl, don't you know I miss it? 
 And I wonder if you miss it too? 
 Never thought it would end till it did 
 Now, I'm here & I can't stop thinkin' 'about you.

 And all the good times we had, baby 
 Been a few years & I can't deny.

 Oh... 
 She was that girl in the corner 
 Thick-rimmed glasses 
 Everybody laughed 
 Every time she passed us 
 Ever the outcast 
 Had no flavor 
 But who got the last laugh, hey! 
 Always came last 
 No one ever kissed her 
 Missing for days 
 But nobody missed her 
 She went from wallpaper to heartbreaker 
 You should've seen her

 My baby’s so intelligent 
 Down with it 
 Independent 
 Got it all 
 Hey hey hey hey hey hey

 I can't let you go 
 My love's wasted on you 
 And even though I'm no fool 
 I know I'm just passing through 
 But now I know, 
 My love's wasted on you 
 If only I could hate you 
 I mean I try but I just can't 
 Or maybe I could find you 
 In the arms of another man 
 Even though we both know 
 It's the beginning to our end 
 I'm running out of excuses 
 Lying to myself, keep thinking you can change 
 I know I gotta give you up 
 But I just can't let you go 
 Save my love for another 
 'Cause it's wasted on you 
 And even though you drown me 
 I keep holding on to you 
 I can't let you go

 And even though I'm no fool 
 I know I'm just passing through 
 But now I know, 
 My love's wasted on you

 It just don't feel right not to hold you, 
 It's getting hard to be friends. 
 Do you feel what I feel the closer that we get 
 It's almost like there's a force that we can't resist. 
 Baby, tell me why, why you wanna stop 
 What's happening inside it's bigger than you and me,

 Even if we run we'll be like a shadow 
 Running from the sun, something you can't escape. 
 It's gonna pull you back to me.

 Fighting, fighting, fighting gravity, 
 Fighting, fighting, fighting, fighting gravity. 
 Baby, look up at the universe, 
 Some things attract to each other, 
 Like the planets and stars. 
 Even though I can't read your mind 
 You know you think about it all the time, 
 So what's keeping us apart? 
 Do you feel what I feel the closer that we get 
 It's almost like there's a force that we can't resist.

 It didn't even help at all, 
 You're simply too beautiful. 
 Got you frozen in a frame inside my mind. 
 How can I forget your smile, 
 Even for a little while? 
 They say the time will take this pain away, 
 Time will heal these scars you made, 
 Time will give me back my heart again. 
 Do you even know what you do to me, 
 How I'm drowning in your memories? 
 So what to breath, now that you've gone? 
 Do you know it rips out the heart of me, 
 Every time I wake up here alone? 
 How can I move on? 
 All I do is miss you more, and more. 
 Everyday I miss you more, and more. 
 I know that I should walk away and close the door, 
 But how is that possible 
 When you're so beautiful? 
 And the fire in my heart, it burns so bright.

 The flames are gonna touch the sky.

 I wish that I could kiss you,

 They kept poppin' up like tissues, 
 One after the next, 
 Life is so complex, 
 Used to waitin' for your text, 
 Now I dread what happens next. 
 Oh damn, I don't understand, 
 I thought I was your man, 
 Now I messed up all the plans. 
 I'd be lyin' if I said I wasn't cryin', 
 Miss you more but I'm tryin' 
 To miss you less 'cause I'm dyin'. 
 You don't even know what you do to me, 
 How I'm drowning in your memories.

 And her sexy shadows hanging over me

 My legs are frozen into the ground 
 As she comes closer 
 The air gets colder 
 Sending shivers down my spine 
 And I feel her hands all over my body 
 And I know I'm running out of time 
 That girl is a killer 
 Killer 
 Killer 
 She'll hit you and run 
 Girl is just a killer killer 
 You know she's only it in for the fun 
 I'm barely bleeding on floor 
 Still beggin' her for more, 
 Oh what a sweet way to die 
 That girl is a killer killer 
 I'll see you on the other side

 I got this funny feelin' baby 
 That it's going to be that time again 
 When you have the need for someone else 
 I know you better than you know yourself

 To understand the weakness of her man 
 It's gonna take the strength of this woman 
 To keep fightin' for the lovin' of her man 
 And darlin' when you've been satisfied 
 And it isn't new to you no more 
 Think of me, I'll be here alone 
 Waitin' for you to find your way back home

 Oh I know how hard you tried 
 To hide this all from me 
 But if you keep a silent heart 
 I can't give you what you need 
 So hold me close and hold me tight

 Do you remember, or should I rewind 
 To that summer when you caught my eye 
 I played it cool, the weather was hot 
 You had the beauty and the beach on lock 
 With your flip flops, half shirt, short shorts, mini skirt 
 Walkin' on the beach so pretty 
 You wasn't lookin' for a man, when you saw me in the sand 
 But you fell for the boy from the city 
 I was like, ""Hey, girl, can I get your number"" 
 I remember what you told me too 
 ""Don't call after ten,"" but you know that I did 
 'Cause I couldn't stop thinkin' 'bout you 
 I think about you in the summertime 
 (Oh oh) 
 And all the good times we had, baby 
 Been a few years and I can't deny 
 (Oh oh) 
 The thought of you still makes me crazy 
 I think about you in the summertime 
 (Oh oh) 
 I'm sittin' here in the sun with you on my mind 
 You're my, my summertime 
 Do you remember? I'll never forget 
 Swimming around all soakin' wet 
 The water was cool, the weather was hot 
 Looking for Nemo while the ocean rocked 
 In your strapless sundress, kickin' back, no stress 
 As long as we was together 
 'Cause we were feelin' young love, and we couldn't get enough 
 Baby, I could reminisce forever 
 And now I'm like, hey, girl, don't you know I miss it 
 And I wonder if you miss it too 
 Never thought it would end 'til it did 
 Now, I'm here and I can't stop thinkin' 'bout you 
 I think about you in the summertime

 And all the good times we had, baby 
 Been a few years and I can't deny

 The thought of you still makes me crazy 
 I think about you in the summertime 
 (Oh oh) 
 I'm sittin' here in the sun with you on my mind 
 You're my, my summertime 
 Break it down 
 Summer ended, winter started 
 It got colder, when we parted ways 
 (I like this part) 
 As the seasons change 
 (Bring it forward, bring it back) 
 Winter melted, spring I felt it 
 Summertime will never be the same 
 (Without you, my summertime) 
 My summertime 
 I think about you in the summertime 
 I think about you 
 And all the good times we had, baby 
 It's been a few years and I can't deny 
 I can't deny

 The thought of you still makes me crazy
