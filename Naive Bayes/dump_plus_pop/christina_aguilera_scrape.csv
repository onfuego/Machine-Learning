5,Christina Aguilera,pop,Reflection,"Look at me 
 You may think you see 
 Who I really am 
 But you'll never know me 
 Every day 
 It's as if I play a part 
 Now I see 
 If I wear a mask 
 I can fool the world 
 But I cannot fool my heart 
 Who is that girl I see 
 Staring straight back at me? 
 When will my reflection show 
 Who I am inside? 
 I am now 
 In a world where I 
 Have to hide my heart 
 And what I believe in 
 But somehow 
 I will show the world 
 What's inside my heart 
 And be loved for who I am 
 Who is that girl I see 
 Staring straight back at me? 
 Why is my reflection 
 Someone I don't know? 
 Must I pretend that I'm 
 Someone else for all time? 
 When will my reflection show 
 Who I am inside? 
 There's a heart that must be 
 Free to fly 
 That burns with a need to know 
 The reason why 
 Why must we all conceal 
 What we think, how we feel? 
 Must there be a secret me 
 I'm forced to hide? 
 I won't pretend that I'm 
 Someone else for all time 
 When will my reflection show 
 Who I am inside? 
 When will my reflection show 
 Who I am inside?"

8,Christina Aguilera,pop,When You Put Your Hands On Me,"When you put your hands on me 
 When you put your hands on me 
 I don't know about the travel of time 
 And I've never seen most of the world 
 I don't know diving out of the sky 
 Or living like the diamonds of pearls 
 See I haven't danced to a musical tune 
 And I haven't noticed the flowers in bloom 
 I haven't smiled when alone in my room very much 
 Then we touched 
 I just know when you put your hands on me 
 I feel sexy and my body turns to gold 
 I just know when you put your hands on me 
 I feel ready and I lose my self-control 
 When you put your hands on me 
 I don't know if a doll can unwind 
 Or how to make a person go 
 I don't know how to be what you like 
 And simply open up the depths of my soul 
 So I keep my wings and my eyes on the down 
 Ready for nothing but holding my ground 
 I haven't used a particular noun very much 
 Then we touched 
 I just know when you put your hands on me 
 I feel sexy and my body turns to gold 
 I just know when you put your hands on me 
 I feel ready and I lose my self-control 
 When you put your hands on me 
 I won't notice or pay you no mind 
 Boy I couldn't care less what you do with your time 
 Your fingertips on my hips just move me like one of a kind 
 I just know when you put your hands on me 
 I feel sexy and my body turns to gold 
 I just know when you put your hands on me 
 I feel ready and I lose my self-control 
 I feel ready and I lose my self-control 
 I feel ready and I lose my self-control"
9,Christina Aguilera,pop,Blessed,"Ooh Ooh Hoo ooh

 When I think how life used to be 
 Always walking in the shadows 
 Then I look at what you've given me 
 I feel like dancing on my tip toes 
 I must say everyday I wake 
 And realize you're by my side 
 I know I'm truly... 
 Blessed for everything you've given me 
 Blessed for all the tenderness you show 
 Do my best with every breath that's in me 
 Blessed to make sure you never go 
 There are times that test your faith 
 Till you think you might surrender 
 Baby I'm, I'm not ashamed to say 
 That my hopes were growing slender 
 You walked by in the knick of time 
 Looking like an answered prayer 
 You know I'm truly... 
 Blessed for everything you've given me 
 Blessed for all the tenderness you show 
 Do my best with every breath that's in me 
 Blessed to make sure you never go 
 Blessed with love and understanding 
 Blessed when I hear you call my name 
 (I hear you call my name) 
 I'll do my best with faith that's never ending 
 Blessed to make sure you feel the same 
 Deep inside of me you fill me with your gentle touch 
 I know I'm truly... 
 Blessed for everything you've given me 
 Blessed for all the tenderness you show (oh oh) 
 Do my best with every breath that's in me 
 Blessed to see you never go

 Is my face aglow

 I'm feeling like a little girl 
 Caught up in emotions 
 I'm out of control

 Do you see my hands, they tremble 
 Wonder why I can't look you in the eyes 
 Don't know how long 
 I can keep this inside 
 Isn't it obvious? 
 I don't know what I'm doing anymore 
 I'm feeling like a little girl 
 Caught up in emotions

 But it only matters that we both believed, oh 
 You and me, we're a miracle 
 Meant to be and nothing can change it 
 Mountains move and oceans part 
 When they are standing in our way 
 You and me, we're a miracle 
 Angels stand watching over us 
 And heaven shines upon us everyday 
 Everytime I felt near defeat 
 You were there for me oh 
 On my side completely 
 You give me strength, oh 
 You set me free 
 It's just because of you, oh, I'm all that I can be 
 When I'm with you 
 The world is ours to reach for 
 Together there is nothing we can't do oh oh oh

 That we would ever be, oh 
 Two stars among the heavens

 No soy, como quiero no

 No debe ser así 
 El fingir, no es vivir 
 La que veo frente a mí 
 No aguanta más

 Me rescatará 
 Y ese día, quien yo soy

 Sneaking a kiss under the mistletoe 
 I want a white Christmas so let it snow 
 Everybody is home for Christmas 
 Everybody is home 
 Friends come together as we decorate the tree 
 This is the time of year to live in harmony, oh 
 Angels watch over as we put the kids to sleep 
 And when they awake their smiling faces 
 Make it all complete, oh 
 This is the holiday you're with the family 
 We put aside our differences and let it be, oh 
 Oh, how much fun it is to give and to receive 
 This time of year, love is all we need

 And tiny tots with their eyes all a glow 
 Will find it hard to sleep tonight 
 They know that Santa's on his way 
 He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh 
 And every mother's child is gonna spy 
 To see if reindeer really know how to fly 
 And so I'm offering this simple phrase 
 To kids from one to ninety-two

 Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas,

 All right now, baby, it's a-all right now. 
 All right now, baby, it's a-all right now. 
 (Let me tell you now) 
 I took her home to my place, 
 Watchin' every move on her face; 
 She said, ""Look, what's your game? 
 Are you tryin' to put me to shame?"" 
 I said ""Slow, don't go so fast, don't you think that love can last?"" 
 She said, ""Love, Lord above, 
 Why you're tryin' to trick me in love."" 
 All right now, baby, it's a-all right now. 
 All right now, baby, it's a-all right now."
51,Christina Aguilera,pop,Stripped (Intro),"Waited a long time for this, feels right now 
 Allow me to introduce myself 
 Want you to come a little closer 
 I'd like you to get to know me 
 A little better... meet the real me 
 Sorry you can't define me... sorry I break the mold 
 Sorry that I speak my mind 
 Sorry I do what I'm told 
 Sorry if I don't fake it, sorry I come too real 
 I will never hide what I really feel, no way oh 
 So here it is... 
 No hype... 
 No glass... 
 No pretense... 
 Just me... stripped"
52,Christina Aguilera,pop,Can't Hold Us Down,"So, what am I not supposed to have an opinion? 
 Should I keep quiet just because I'm a woman? 
 Call me a bitch 'cause I speak what's on my mind 
 Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled 
 When a female fires back 
 Suddenly the target don't know how to act 
 So he does what any little boy would do 
 Makin' up a few false rumors or two 
 That for sure is not a man to me 
 Slanderin' names for popularity 
 It's sad you only get your fame through controversy (It's sad) 
 But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say 
 This is for my girls all around the world 
 Who've come across a man that don't respect your worth 
 Thinking all women should be seen, not heard 
 So what do we do girls? (Shout louder!) 
 Letting 'em know we're gonna stand our ground 
 Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud 
 Take a deep breath and say it loud 
 Never can, never will, can't hold us down 
 Nobody can hold us down 
 Nobody can hold us down 
 Nobody can hold us down 
 Never can, never will 
 So what am I not supposed to say what I'm saying 
 Are you offended with the message I'm bringing 
 Call me whatever 'cause your words don't mean a thing 
 Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing 
 If you look back in history 
 It's a common double standard of society 
 The guy gets all, the glory the more he can score 
 While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore 
 I don't understand why it's okay 
 The guy can get away with it and the girl gets named 
 All my ladies come together and make a change 
 Start a new beginning for us everybody sing 
 This is for my girls all around the world 
 Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth (Respect your worth) 
 Thinking all women should be seen, not heard 
 What do we do girls? (Shout louder!) 
 Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground 
 So lift your hands high and wave 'em proud 
 Take a deep breath and say it loud 
 Never can, never will, can't hold us down 
 Check it 
 Now here's something I just can't understand 
 If the guy have three girls then he's the man 
 He can even give her some head, or sex her off 
 But if a girl do the same, she's a whore 
 But the table's about to turn, I'll bet my fame on it 
 Cats take my ideas and put their name on it 
 It's all right though, you can't hold me down 
 I got to keep on movin' 
 To my girls to their man who be trying to Mac 
 Do it right back to him and let that be that 
 You need to let him know that his game is whack 
 And Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera got your back 
 But you're just a little boy 
 Think you're so cute, so coy 
 You must talk so big 
 To make up for smaller things 
 So you're just a little boy 
 All you do is annoy 
 You must talk so big 
 To make up for smaller things (This is for my girls!) 
 This is for my girls all around the world 
 Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth 
 Thinking all women should be seen, not heard 
 So what do we do girls? (Shout louder!), shout louder 
 Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground (Stand our ground) 
 Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud (Ohoho, ooh) 
 Take a deep breath and say it loud 
 Never can, never will, can't hold us down 
 This is for my girls all around the world (For my girls) 
 Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth (Around the world!) 
 Thinking all women should be seen, not heard (Yeaheah) 
 So what do we do girls? (Shout louder!) 
 Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground (Stand my ground) 
 Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud (Ohoho) 
 Take a deep breath and say it loud 
 Never can, never will, can't hold us down 
 Spread the word 
 Can't hold us down 
 Yeah 
 We here 
 Be back again 
 Yeah, Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera 
 Yeah 
 Can't hold us down!"
53,Christina Aguilera,pop,Walk Away,"What do you do when you know something's bad for you 
 And you still can't let go? 
 I was naive 
 Your love was like candy 
 Artificially sweet 
 I was deceived by the wrapping 
 Got caught in your web 
 And I learned how to bleed 
 I was prey in your bed 
 And devoured completely 
 And it hurts my soul 
 'Cause I can't let go 
 All these walls are caving in 
 I can't stop my suffering 
 I hate to show that I've lost control 
 'Cause I, I keep going right back 
 To the one thing that I need to walk away from 
 I need to get away from ya 
 I need to walk away from ya 
 Get away, walk away, walk away 
 I should have known 
 I was used for amusement 
 Couldn't see through the smoke 
 It was all an illusion 
 Now I've been licking my wounds (licking my wounds) 
 But the venom seeps deeper (deeper, deeper) 
 We both can seduce 
 But darling you hold me prisoner (prisoner) 
 I'm about to break 
 I can't stop this ache 
 I'm addicted to your allure 
 And I'm fiendin' for a cure 
 Every step I take 
 Leads to one mistake 
 I keep going right back 
 To the one thing that I need... 
 I can't mend 
 This torn state I'm in 
 Getting nothing in return 
 What did I do to deserve 
 The pain of this slow burn 
 And everywhere I turn 
 I keep going right back 
 To the one thing that I need to walk away from 
 I need to get away from ya 
 I need to walk away from ya 
 Everytime I try to grasp for air 
 I get smothered in despair, it's never over, over 
 Seems I'll never wake from this nightmare, 
 I let out a silent prayer 
 That it be over, over 
 Inside I'm screaming, 
 Begging pleading no more 
 I don't know what to do 
 My heart has been bruised 
 So sad but it's true 
 Each beat reminds me of you 
 It hurts my soul 
 'Cause I can't let go 
 All these walls are caving in 
 I can't stop my suffering 
 I hate to show that I've lost control 
 Cause i 
 I keep going right back 
 To the one thing that I need, oh 
 I'm about to break 
 And I can't stop this ache 
 I'm addicted to your allure 
 And I'm fiendin' for a cure 
 Every step I take 
 Leads to one mistake 
 I keep going right back 
 To the one thing that I need, oh 
 I can't mend 
 This torn state I'm in 
 Getting nothing in return 
 What did I do to deserve 
 The pain of this slow burn 
 And everywhere I turn 
 I keep going right back 
 To the one thing that I need to walk away from 
 I say... 
 I need to get away from ya 
 I need to walk away from ya 
 Get away, walk away, walk away 
 Only thing I need to do is walk away 
 I need to get away from ya 
 I need to walk away from ya 
 Get away, walk away, walk away 
 I need to get away from ya 
 I need to walk away from ya 
 Get away, walk away, walk away 
 I need to get away from ya 
 I need to walk away from ya 
 Get away, walk away, walk away"
54,Christina Aguilera,pop,Fighter,"After all you put me through 
 You think I'd despise you 
 But in the end I wanna thank you 
 'Cause you made me that much stronger 
 Well, I thought I knew you 
 Thinking that you were true 
 I guess I, I couldn't trust, called your bluff 
 Time is up, 'cause I've had enough 
 You were there by my side 
 Always down for the ride 
 But your joyride just came down in flames 
 'Cause your greed sold me out in shame, mmm 
 After all of the stealing and cheating 
 You probably think that I hold resentment for you 
 But, oh, oh, oh no, you're wrong 
 'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do 
 I wouldn't know just how capable I am to pull through 
 So I wanna say thank you 
 'Cause it makes me that much stronger 
 Makes me work a little bit harder 
 It makes me that much wiser 
 So thanks for making me a fighter 
 Made me learn a little bit faster 
 Made my skin a little bit thicker 
 Makes me that much smarter 
 So thanks for making me a fighter 
 Oho, oho 
 Oho, oho 
 Ohohoho, yeaheaheah 
 Aha 
 Never saw it coming 
 All of your backstabbing 
 Just so you could cash in on a good thing 
 Before I realized your game 
 I heard you're going around 
 Playing the victim now 
 But don't even begin feeling I'm the one to blame 
 'Cause you dug your own grave 
 After all of the fights and the lies 
 Guess you're wanting to hurt me 
 But that won't work anymore 
 No more, aha, it's over 
 'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture 
 I wouldn't know how to be this way now 
 And never back down 
 So I wanna say thank you 
 'Cause it makes me that much stronger 
 Makes me work a little bit harder 
 Makes me that much wiser 
 So thanks for making me a fighter 
 Made me learn a little bit faster 
 Made my skin a little bit thicker 
 It makes me that much smarter 
 So thanks for making me a fighter 
 How could this man I thought I knew 
 Turn out to be unjust so cruel 
 Could only see the good in you 
 Pretended not to see the truth 
 You tried to hide your lies 
 Disguise yourself through living in denial 
 But in the end you'll see 
 You won't stop me 
 I am a fighter and I (I'm a fighter) 
 I ain't gonna stop (I ain't gonna stop) 
 There is no turning back 
 I've had enough 
 'Cause it makes me that much stronger 
 Makes me work a little bit harder 
 Makes me that much wiser 
 So thanks for making me a fighter 
 Made me learn a little bit faster 
 Made my skin a little bit thicker 
 It makes me that much smarter 
 So thanks for making me a fighter 
 Thought I would forget 
 But I, I remember, ohohohoho 
 Yes, I remember, ohoho 
 I remember! 
 Thought I would forget, ooohooohooo 
 I remember, ohoho 
 Yes, I remember, ohoho! 
 I remember! 
 Makes me that much stronger 
 Makes me work a little bit harder 
 Makes me that much wiser 
 So thanks for making me a fighter 
 Made me learn a little bit faster 
 Made my skin a little bit thicker 
 Makes me that much smarter 
 Thanks for making me a fighter"
55,Christina Aguilera,pop,Primer Amor (Interlude),"Yo te contaré, una historia 
 De como un puertorriqueño me robó el corazón 
 Nunca más he vuelto a amar de esa manera 
 Quizás, jamás lo haré 
 Es la historia de mi primer amor 
 Era buenmozo 
 Con grandes y profundos ojos marrones 
 Un bailarán 
 Juntos, nos perdimos en el ritmo del amor 
 Así es como comenzó"
56,Christina Aguilera,pop,Infatuation,"He comes from a foreign place 
 An island far away 
 Intrigues me with every move 
 Till I'm breathless, I'm helpless 
 Can't keep my cool 
 Steals my heart when he takes my hand 
 And we dance, to the rhythm of the band 
 I feel his finger tips, grip my hips 
 And I slip as we dip into a state of bliss 
 Mama used to warn me 
 To beware of those Latin lovers 
 She said I gave my heart too soon 
 And that's how I became your mother 
 I said ay mama, you seem to forget 
 I'm not in love yet 
 Sweet talk don't win me over 
 But I realized 
 Big brown eyes can hypnotize 
 When he says 
 I am full blood boricua 
 Reads the tattoo on his arm 
 He tells me, mami I need ya 
 And my heartbeat pumps so strong 
 Getting lost in el ritmo 
 He whispers te quiero, te quiero 
 I begin to give in with no hesitation 
 Can't help my infatuation 
 It's pure infatuation 
 Skin the color of cinnamon 
 His eyes light up and I melt within 
 Feels so good it must be a sin 
 I can't stop what I started 
 I'm giving in 
 He brings life to my fantasies 
 Sparks a passion inside of me 
 Finds the words when I can not speak 
 In the silence, his heartbeat is music to me 
 But Mama used to warn me 
 Not to rush love with another 
 She said I'm not trying to lecture 
 I just care about my daughter 
 Ay mama, you seem to forget 
 I never will let 
 A man control my emotions 
 But when he smiles (when he smiles) 
 I feel like a little child 
 When he says 
 I am full blood boricua 
 Reads the tattoo on his arm 
 He tells me, mami I need ya 
 And my heartbeat pumps so strong 
 Getting lost in el ritmo 
 He whispers te quiero, te quiero 
 I begin to give in with no hesitation 
 Can't help my infatuation 
 It's pure infatuation 
 Caught between my mama's words 
 And what I feel inside 
 I'm wanting to explore his world 
 But part of me wants to hide 
 Should I risk it, can't resist it 
 This has caught me by surprise 
 Should I, let him take me to Puerto Rico 
 I can't hold back no more 
 Let's go tonight... 
 Papi hold me, say that you adore me 
 Never let go never leave me lonely 
 I am full blood boricua 
 Reads the tattoo on his arm 
 He tells me, mami I need ya 
 And my heartbeat pumps so strong 
 Getting lost in el ritmo 
 He whispers te quiero, te quiero 
 I begin to give in with no hesitation 
 Can't help my infatuation 
 It's pure infatuation 
 I can't help what I'm feeling 
 I'm infatuated (It's pure infatuation) 
 (Can't help my infatuation) 
 Papi hold me, say that you adore me 
 Never let go never leave me lonely 
 It's pure infatuation"
57,Christina Aguilera,pop,Love's Embrace (Interlude),"I will tell you, a story 
 Of how a Puerto Rican stole my heart 
 I have never loved that way again 
 Perhaps, I never will 
 It is the story of my first love 
 He was handsome 
 With big and deep brown eyes 
 A dancer 
 Together, we were lost in the rhythm of love 
 This is how it began"
58,Christina Aguilera,pop,Loving Me 4 Me,"People ask if I'm in love with you 
 Because I'm sitting here with your picture 
 And smiling to myself (I smile) 
 I'm kinda lost in my own thoughts of you 
 My heart speaks before my mind thinks through 
 And I blush as I say yes (yes) 
 What a feeling of vulnerability coming over me 
 And I'm feeling weak and I can't speak (speak) and I can't think 
 Never thought I'd give in so willingly to a human being 
 With abilities to set me free 
 Free, and let me be me 
 Makes me want to say 
 Your lips, your eyes, your smile, your kiss 
 I must admit it's a part of me 
 You please me, complete me, believe me 
 Like a melody 
 Your soul, your flow, your youth, your truth is simply proof 
 We were meant to be 
 But the best quality that's hookin' me 
 Is that you're loving me for me (loving me) 
 Is that you're loving me for me (ooh) 
 People ask why I'm in love with you 
 Well, let me start by saying 
 You got my heart by just being who you are 
 And what we got is between me and you 
 It doesn't matter about the money I make 
 Or what I do, or that I'm a, huh, a star 
 Unconditionally you're there for me 
 Undeniably you inspire me, spiritually, oh so sweet 
 This is meaningful, it's incredible, pleasurable, unforgettable 
 The way I feel, so surreal 
 Makes me want to say 
 Your lips, your eyes, your smile, your kiss 
 I must admit it's a part of me 
 You please me, complete me, believe me 
 Like a melody 
 Your soul, your flow, your youth, your truth is simply proof 
 We were meant to be 
 But the best quality that's hookin' me 
 Is that you're loving me for me (loving me) 
 Is that you're loving me for me (oh oh yeah) 
 It's so amazing how something so sweet 
 Has come and rearranged my life 
 I've been kissed by destiny 
 Oh, heaven came and saved me 
 An angel was placed at my feet 
 This isn't ordinary, he's loving me for me 
 Stripped of all make up, no need for fancy clothes 
 No cover ups, push ups 
 With him, I don't have to put on a show 
 He loves every freckle, every curve, every inch of my skin 
 Fulfilling me entirely, taking all of me in 
 He's real, he's honest, and he's loving me for me 
 Yeah"
59,Christina Aguilera,pop,Impossible,"It's impossible 
 It's impossible to love you 
 If you don't let me know what you're feeling 
 It's impossible for me to give you what you need 
 If you're always hidin' from me 
 I don't know what hurt you 
 But I just, I wanna make it right 
 'Cause boy I'm sick tired of tryin' to read your mind 
 'Cause it's impossible (impossible) 
 Ooh baby it's impossible (impossible) 
 For me to love you this way 
 It's impossible (impossible) 
 Oh baby it's impossible (impossible) 
 If you're makin' it this way 
 Impossible to make it easy 
 If you're always tryin' to make it so damn hard 
 How can I, how can I give you all my love baby oh 
 If you always, always puttin' up your guard 
 This is not a circus 
 So don't ya play me for a clown 
 How long can emotions keep on goin' up and down oh 
 It's impossible (impossible) 
 Oh baby it's impossible (impossible) 
 For me to love you, this way (this way) 
 It's impossible (impossible) 
 Oh baby it's impossible (impossible)

 Over, over 
 Impossible baby oh

 Oh baby it's impossible (impossible) 
 If you're makin' it this way 
 Oh oh..."
60,Christina Aguilera,pop,Underappreciated,"I remember when it all first began 
 We were tight right from the start 
 It wasn't long before you came on strong 
 Trying hard to win my heart (trying to win it) 
 I played hard to get but I couldn't help 
 Givin' up my heart in the end 
 You were thoughtful 
 Careful not to hurt the relationship 
 What happened to those days 
 When you used to be compassionate 
 Caring what I thought and said 
 So attentive gentleman 
 Now it's hard to turn your head away from the TV set 
 Taking me for granted lately 
 And frankly, it's gotta quit 
 I feel underappreciated 
 Now girls help me out 
 If you know what I'm talking about 
 I said 
 I'm feeling underappreciated 
 For all the time and effort 
 I have put in this commitment 
 Back to the beginning, to the very beginning 
 When our love was something new 
 Back when romance was important 
 Not just another thing to do 
 I was feeling high on loving life 
 Thought I'd never come back down 
 Now it seems that you and me 
 Have lost our solid ground 
 Half the time I realize 
 I seem to give more than I get (give more than I get) 
 Funny how things seem to change 
 After a few years commitment (commitment) 
 Used to talk for hours on end 
 About our dreams while we lay in bed 
 How I missed those days when you stayed awake 
 Now you roll over and snore instead 
 I feel underappreciated 
 Now girls help me out 
 If you know what I'm talking about 
 I said 
 I'm feeling underappreciated 
 For all the time and effort 
 I have put in this commitment 
 I miss those nice massages 
 The long phone calls 
 And the way you talk 
 How it turned me on 
 Miss the bubble baths 
 Had the sweetest laughs 
 I'm needing those days back 
 I feel underappreciated 
 Now girls help me out 
 If you know what I'm talking about 
 I said 
 I'm feeling underappreciated 
 For all the time and effort 
 I have put in this commitment 
 I feel (I feel underappreciated) 
 Oh yeah, 
 If you feel me sing it with me 
 Come on help out

 Yeah, yeah, yeah"
61,Christina Aguilera,pop,Beautiful,"Don't look at me 
 Every day is so wonderful 
 And suddenly it's hard to breathe 
 Now and then I get insecure 
 From all the pain, I'm so ashamed 
 I am beautiful no matter what they say 
 Words can't bring me down 
 I am beautiful in every single way 
 Yes, words can't bring me down 
 So don't you bring me down today 
 To all your friends you're delirious 
 So consumed in all your doom 
 Trying hard to fill the emptiness 
 The piece is gone, left the puzzle undone 
 Ain't that the way it is? 
 'Cause you are beautiful no matter what they say 
 Words can't bring you down, oh no, no 
 'Cause you are beautiful in every single way 
 Yes, words can't bring you down, oh no 
 So don't you bring me down today 
 No matter what we do (No matter what we do) 
 No matter what we say (No matter what we say) 
 We're the song inside the tune (Yeaheah, yeaheah!) 
 Full of beautiful mistakes 
 And everywhere we go (And everywhere we go) 
 The sun will always shine (The sun will always, always shine!) 
 And tomorrow we might awake on the other side 
 'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say 
 Yes, words won't bring us down, no, no 
 We are beautiful in every single way 
 Yes, words can't bring us down, oh no

 I just wanna live simple and free 
 I just wanna get away 
 Savin' all your bullshit for another day 
 Feeling confined like I'm bein' force fed 
 My visions blurry and I'm lost in regrets 
 It's overload and I'm outta control 
 (Outta control) 
 So sick and tired of bein' misused 
 (So misused) 
 You're taking me down with all your mental abuse 
 And I said, I gotta get you outta my head 
 Everybody's always trying to look me over 
 I just wanna live simple and free 
 I just wanna get away 
 Saving all your bullshit for another day 
 I'm the only one that can rescue me from me 
 Leaving the house around quarter to five 
 Zipped up my boots and I'm ready to ride 
 And I feel so high, I feel so alive 
 Let down my hair feel the wind on my skin 
 Crossin' the border where my new life begins 
 And I close my eyes and take it all in 
 I don't need nobody tryin' to make me over 
 (Don't make me over) 
 I just want to live simple and free 
 I just wanna get away 
 Saving all your bullshit for another day 
 I'm the only one that can rescue me from me 
 I just wanna get away 
 Saving all your bullshit for another day 
 I'm the only one that can rescue me from me

 You wanna break me down 
 You wanna break me down 
 You wanna ... break me down"
63,Christina Aguilera,pop,Cruz,"I'm leaving today 
 Living it 
 Leaving it 
 To change 
 Slowly drifting 
 Into a peaceful breeze 
 Tongue tied and twisted 
 Are all my memories 
 Celebrating a fantasy come true 
 Packing all my bags 
 Finally on the move 
 I'm leaving today 
 I'm living it 
 Oh I'm leaving it 
 To change 
 As I'm driving 
 I'm captured by the view 
 So much beauty 
 The road becomes my muse 
 The heat is rising 
 And my hand surfs through the wind 
 Cool, calm, collected 
 Is the child that lies within 
 See I'm leaving today 
 I'm living it 
 Oh I'm leaving it 
 To change, oh yeah 
 See I'm leaving today, oh yes I'm 
 Living it 
 Oh I'm leaving it 
 To change 
 But somehow I miss it 
 I think I'll really miss it 
 One day, oh 
 I turn on the radio 
 And I'm feeling like I've never felt before 
 Turn down the memories of 
 Yesteryears and broken dreams I'm free 
 Finally free, ooh 
 Slowly drifting 
 Into a peaceful breeze, oh 
 Oh 
 Ooh yeah 
 I'm leaving today, oh yes I'm 
 Living it, oh yeah

 To change, oh no 
 See I'm leaving today, oh yes I'm

 I think I'll really miss it 
 One day, yeah"
64,Christina Aguilera,pop,Soar,"When they push when they pull tell me can you hold on? 
 When they say you should change can you lift your head high 
 And stay strong? 
 Will you give up, give in when your heart's crying out that it's wrong? 
 Will you love you for you at the end of it all? 
 Now in life, there's gonna be times when you're feeling low 
 And in your mind insecurity seems to take control 
 We start to look outside ourselves for acceptance and approval 
 We keep forgettin' that the one thing we should know is 
 Don't be scared to fly alone, find a path that is your own 
 Love will open every door it's in your hands the world is yours 
 Don't hold back and always know, all the answers will unfold 
 What are you waiting for, spread your wings and soar 
 The boy who wonders is he good enough for them 
 Keeps tryin' to please 'em all but he just never seems to fit in 
 Then there's the girl who thinks she'll never ever be good enough for him 
 Keeps tryin' to change and that's a game she'll never win 
 Now in life there's gonna be times when you're feeling low 
 And in your mind insecurity seems to take control 
 We start to look outside ourselves for acceptance and approval 
 We keep forgetting that the one thing we should know is 
 Don't be scared to fly alone, find a path that is your own 
 Love will open every door it's in your hands the world is yours 
 Don't hold back and always know, all the answers will unfold 
 What are you waiting for, spread your wings and soar 
 In the mirror is where she comes face to face with her fears 
 Her own reflection now foreign to her after all these years 
 All of her life she has tried to be something besides herself 
 Now time has passed and she's ended up with someone else with regret 
 What is it in us that makes us feel the need 
 To keep pretending gotta let ourselves be 
 Don't be scared to fly alone, find a path that is your own 
 Love will open every door it's in your hands the world is yours 
 Don't hold back and always know, all the answers will unfold 
 Don't wait for, spread your wings and soar 
 Don't be scared to fly alone, find a path that is your own 
 Love will open every door it's in your hands the world is yours 
 Don't hold back and always know all the answers will unfold 
 What are you waiting for, spread your wings and soar 
 What are you waiting for, spread your wings and soar 
 So whatcha waiting for?"
65,Christina Aguilera,pop,"Get Mine, Get Yours","Baby you pretend that things 
 Ain't what they seem 
 All this tension of titling 
 Just exactly what we should be 
 Now I don't mind us being 
 Some kind of casual thing 
 Listen, all I wanna do for now 
 Is have you come and take all of me 
 Can you 
 Put your hands on my waistline 
 Want your skin up against mine 
 Move my hips to the baseline 
 Let me get mine, you get yours 
 Hang a please don't disturb sign 
 Put my back into a slow grind 
 Sending chills up and down my spine 
 Let me get mine, you get yours 
 If you see me with a man 
 Understand that you can't question me 
 The feelings that you caught 
 Ain't my fault, can't help your jealousy 
 If you can handle the fact that 
 What we have has got to be commitment free 
 Then we can keep this undercover lovin', cummin' 
 Hidden underneath the sheets 
 Can you 
 Put your hands on my waistline 
 Want your skin up against mine 
 Move my hips to the baseline 
 Let me get mine, you get yours (but don't fall in love) 
 Hang a please don't disturb sign 
 Put my back into a slow grind 
 Sending chills up and down my spine 
 Let me get mine, you get yours 
 So, come on and freak my body 
 We can get nasty, naughty 
 All night a private party 
 Gotta hit that spot just right 
 Work me like a 9 to 5 
 It ain't about the kissin' and huggin' 
 Cause this is a physical lovin' 
 Straight sweatin', our bodies are rubbin' 
 Gotta hit that spot just right 
 Work me like a 9 to 5 
 We have a physical thing 
 We'll make love, but don't fall in love (Let me get mine, you get yours, oh ooh) 
 We spend time 
 Just enough so you get yours, and I get mine 
 No strings attached (Let me get mine, you get yours) 
 I want your body, not your heart 
 Can you 
 Put your hands on my waistline (put your hands on my waistline) 
 Want your skin up against mine 
 Move my hips to the baseline 
 Let me get mine, you get yours (but don't fall in love) 
 Hang a please don't disturb sign

 Sending chills up and down my spine 
 Let me get mine, you get yours 
 Put your hands on my waistline 
 Want your skin up against mine 
 Move my hips to the baseline 
 Let me get mine, you get yours (but don't fall in love) 
 Hang a please don't disturb sign 
 Put my back into a slow grind

68,Christina Aguilera,pop,The Voice Within,"Young girl, don't cry 
 I'll be right here when your world starts to fall 
 Young girl, it's all right 
 Your tears will dry, you'll soon be free to fly 
 When you're safe inside your room you tend to dream 
 Of a place where nothing's harder than it seems 
 No one ever wants or bothers to explain 
 Of the heartache life can bring and what it means 
 When there's no one else, look inside yourself 
 Like your oldest friend just trust the voice within 
 Then you'll find the strength that will guide your way 
 You'll learn to begin to trust the voice within 
 Oho, young girl, don't hide 
 You'll never change if you just run away, ooohoooo, oh yeah 
 Young girl, just hold tight 
 Soon you're gonna see your brighter day, ohohoho 
 Now in a world where innocence is quickly claimed 
 It's so hard to stand your ground when you're so afraid 
 No one reaches out a hand for you to hold 
 When you're lost outside, look inside to your soul 
 When there's no one else, look inside yourself 
 Like your oldest friend just trust the voice within 
 Then you'll find the strength that will guide your way 
 You'll learn to begin to trust the voice within 
 Oh, yeaheah 
 Ooohooohooo 
 Yeah 
 Ooh, yeah 
 Life is a journey 
 It can take you anywhere you choose to go 
 As long as you're learning 
 You'll find all you'll ever need to know 
 (Be strong) Break it 
 (Hold on) You'll make it 
 (Be strong) Just don't forsake it because 
 (No one can tell you what you can't do) 
 No one can stop you, you know that I'm talking to you 
 When there's no one else, look inside yourself 
 Like your oldest friend just trust the voice within 
 Then you'll find the strength that will guide your way 
 You'll learn to begin to trust the voice within 
 Young girl, don't cry 
 I'll be right here when your world starts to fall"
69,Christina Aguilera,pop,I'm OK,"Once upon a time there was a girl 
 In her early years she had to learn 
 How to grow up living in a war that she called home 
 Never knew just where to turn for shelter from the storm 
 It hurt me to see the pain across my mother's face 
 Every time my father's fist would put her in her place 
 Hearing all the yelling I would cry up in my room 
 Hoping it would be over soon 
 Bruises fade, father, but the pain remains the same 
 And I still remember how you kept me so afraid 
 The strength is my mother for all the love she gave 
 And every morning that I wake, I look back at yesterday 
 And I'm okay 
 I often wonder why I carry all this guilt 
 When it's you that helped me put up all these walls I've built 
 Shadows stir at night through a crack in the door 
 The echoes of a broken child screaming, please, no more 
 Daddy don't you understand the damage you have done? 
 For you it's just a memory but for me it still lives on 
 Bruises fade, father, but the pain remains the same 
 And I still remember how you kept me so, so afraid 
 The strength is my mother for all the love she gave 
 Every morning that I wake, I look back at yesterday 
 It's not so easy to forget, all the marks you left along her neck 
 When I was thrown against cold stairs 
 And every day afraid to come home in fear of what I might see next 
 Bruises fade, father, but the pain remains the same 
 And I still remember how you kept me so afraid 
 The strength is my mother for all the love you gave 
 And every morning that I wake, I look back on yesterday 
 And I'm okay 
 I'm okay"
70,Christina Aguilera,pop,Keep On Singin' My Song,"I woke up this morning with a smile on my face 
 And nobody's gonna bring me down today 
 Been feeling like nothing's been going my way lately 
 But I decided right here and now 
 That my outlook's gonna change 
 That's why I'm gonna 
 Say goodbye to all the tears I've cried 
 Everytime somebody hurt my pride 
 Feelin' like they won't let me live life and 
 Take the time to look at what is mine 
 I see every blessing so clearly 
 And I thank God for what I got from above 
 I believe they can take anything from me 
 But they can't succeed in taking my inner peace from me 
 They can say all they wanna say about me 
 But I'm gonna carry on (Carry on) 
 I'mma keep on (keep on) singin' my song 
 I never wanna dwell on the pain again 
 There's no use in relivin' how I hurt back then 
 Rememberin' too well the hell I felt 
 When I was runnin' out of faith 
 Every step I'm 'bout to take 
 Moves towards a better day 
 'Cause I'm about to 
 Say farewell to every single lie 
 And all the fears I've held too long inside 
 Everytime I felt I couldn't try 
 All the negativity inside 
 For too long, I've been strugglin', couldn't go on 
 But now I've found I'm feelin' strong and I'm moving on 
 I believe they can take anything from me 
 But they can't succeed in taking my inner peace from me 
 They can say all they wanna say about me 
 But I'm gonna carry on, (carry on) 
 I'mma keep on (keep on) singin' my song 
 Every time I tried to be what they wanted from me 
 It never came naturally, so I ended up in misery 
 Was unable to see all the good around me 
 Wasted so much energy on what they thought of me 
 Than simply just remembering to breathe 
 I'm humanly unable to please everyone at the same time 
 So now I find my peace of mind living one day at a time 
 In the end I answer to one god 
 Comes down to one love till I get to heaven above 
 I have made the decision 
 Never to give in 
 Till the I day I die no matter what 
 I'm gonna carry on, I'mma keep on singin' my song 
 (They can't take anything from me)"

72,Christina Aguilera,pop,That's What Love Can Do,"I wanted a lover 
 To show me the way love goes 
 To know what it felt like 
 To let something take control 
 To live the expression 
 I'm head over heels this time 
 Unafraid to be open 
 And thinking I'd be just fine 
 But I found in the very end 
 That it all depends 
 'Cause love can lift you so high 
 Or it'll leave you to die 
 And it's not like you ever get to choose 
 (Which way that it leads you) 
 Ooh it can play with your mind 
 Or make you feel so alive 
 Either way you'll survive 'cause 
 That's what love can do 
 Oh, yeah yeah 
 That's what love can do 
 I guess now I get why 
 They say love is a dangerous game 
 'Cause when you think that you're winning 
 You find out that you just been been played 
 You give and you sacrifice 
 You make changes in your life 
 Everyone's got advice 
 But no one's got a clue (not even you) 
 And I found in the very end 
 That it all depends 
 'Cause love can lift you so high 
 Or it'll leave you to die 
 And it's not like you ever get to choose 
 (Which way that it leads you) 
 Ooh it can play with your mind 
 Or make you feel so alive 
 Either way you'll survive 'cause 
 That's what love can do 
 Ooh, oh, ooh 
 That's what love can do 
 I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming 
 Dreaming of when I believed in 
 Fairy tales, sunset sails, it never fails 
 Till reality sets in 
 I begin to comprehend how crazy this has been 
 And I can't depend on 
 Anyone for my happily ever after 
 Yeah, yeah 
 'Cause love can lift you so high 
 Or it'll leave you to die 
 And it's not like you ever get to choose 
 (Which way that it leads you) 
 Ooh it can play with your mind 
 Make you feel so alive 
 Either way you'll survive 'cause, oh 
 That's what love can do 
 That's what love can do, oh 
 'Cause that's what love can do, oh yeah

 'Cause I've had enough 
 You were there by my side 
 Always down for the ride 
 But your, your joy ride just came down in flames 
 'Cause your greed sold me out in shame, mm-hmm 
 After all of the stealing and cheating 
 You probably think that I 
 Hold resentment for you 
 But uh-uh, oh no, you're wrong 
 'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do 
 I wouldn't know just how capable 
 I am to pull through 
 So I wanna say thank you 'cause it 
 Makes me that much stronger 
 Makes me work a little bit harder 
 Makes me that much wiser 
 So thanks for making me a fighter 
 Made me learn a little bit faster 
 Made my skin a little bit thicker 
 Makes me that much smarter

 Feelin' I'm the one to blame 
 'Cause you dug your own grave (Uh)

 Yes your wanting to harm me

 How could this man I thought I know 
 Turn out to be unjust, so cruel 
 Could only see the good in you 
 Pretended not to see the truth 
 You tried to hide your lies, disguise yourself 
 Through living in denial 
 But in the end you'll see 
 You won't stop me! 
 I am a fighter and I (I'm a fighter) 
 I ain't gon' stop (I ain't gon' stop) 
 There is no turning back

75,Christina Aguilera,pop,Intro (Back To Basics),"A very pleasant good evening ladies and gentlemen 
 It is now time... 
 The one and only... 
 There never will be another... 
 Christina Aguilera 
 That's how music should sound 
 Oh yeah 
 I've waited for some time 
 To get inside the minds 
 Of every legend I've ever wanted to stand beside 
 It's like an endless ride 
 Feeling the lows and highs 
 Of every lyric and melody 
 Every single rhyme 
 So here I stand today 
 In tribute I do pay 
 To those before me who laid it down and paved the way 
 And so to God I pray that he will give me strength 
 To carry forward the gift of song in his good faith 
 In his good faith... 
 I'm going back to basics 
 To where it all began 
 I'm ready now to face it 
 I wanna understand 
 What made the soul singers 
 And the blues figures 
 That inspired a higher generation 
 The jazz makers, and the ground breakers 
 They gave so much of themselves and dedication 
 So here I stand today 
 In tribute I do pay 
 To those before me who laid it down and paved the way 
 Oh yeah 
 Hey... ha"
76,Christina Aguilera,pop,Makes Me Wanna Pray,"He-hey he-hey oh 
 Oh yeah 
 Well all right 
 He-hey 
 What is this feeling coming over me? 
 I'm taken back in disbelief 
 Is this really me, ha! in the mirror I see? 
 Staring back at me: 
 Could it be? A new reflection of a woman complete 
 All of a sudden I'm so care-free (well all right) 
 'Cause love is doing something strange to me (well all right) 
 Got a new flame, ha! haven't been the same 
 Something in me's changed, rearranged 
 And I feel that I've been saved 
 You got me feeling like you're that something I've been missing 
 Everything's heaven 'cause life with you has been a blessing 
 (Oh-oh oh-oh) 
 I got it bad in a serious way, oh yeah 
 (Oh-oh oh-oh) 
 Your love has brought me to a higher place, oh yeah 
 (Who knew? Who knew?) 
 It'd be you to restore my faith 
 Everyday, I'm amazed 
 And it makes me wanna get down and pray 
 Makes me wanna get down and pray 
 Said it makes me wanna get down and pray 
 Yeah-hey 
 I've kept some company I shouldn't have (well all right) 
 Made some mistakes but that's in the past (well all right) 
 I'm professing here to you 
 Proof that I am through

79,Christina Aguilera,pop,Understand,"I made you think you don't understand 
 I used to think that happiness could only be something

 Everybody could see, everybody but me, yeah yeah

 You opened up my softer side 
 And now I can see into your eyes 
 And suddenly, I realize 
 I made you think you don't understand 
 All the times you didn't understand, why you couldn't just be my man 
 I made you think you don't understand 
 There were many walls you had to climb, if you really wanted to be mine 
 I made you think you don't understand 
 After all the hoops I put you through, now I see that I'm in love with you 
 Now, I hope you finally understand 
 So many tears I've had to cry, 
 But you had many more of your own you had to try 
 But you stuck it out and you're here with me now, yeah yeah 
 And rememberin' the days I pushed away your love 
 You called my bluff and you still stayed around 
 Yeah, you figured me out said, you got me down 
 And there's no way to lie to you 
 You know me better than I do, oh

 To keep my distance for so long 
 So afraid, you wouldn't stay 
 But you never turned away 
 Always right by my side 
 You're forever in my life 
 Don't you go 'cause now I know 
 That in you I found a home

81,Christina Aguilera,pop,Oh Mother,"Whoa, oh, yeah, 
 She was so young with such innocent eyes 
 She always dreamt of a fairytale life 
 And all the things your money can't buy 
 She thought daddy was a wonderful guy 
 Then suddenly, things seemed to change 
 It was the moment she took on his name 
 He took his anger out on her face 
 She kept all of her pain locked away 
 Oh mother, we're stronger 
 From all of the tears you have shed 
 Oh mother, don't look back 
 'Cause he'll never hurt us again 
 So mother, I thank you 
 For all you've done and still do 
 You got me, I got you 
 Together we always pull through 
 We always pull through 
 We always pull through 
 Oh mother, oh mother, oh mother 
 It was the day that he turned on his kids 
 That she knew she just had to leave him 
 So many voices inside of her head 
 Saying over and over and over, 
 ""You deserve much more than this."" 
 She was so sick of believing the lies and trying to hide 
 Covering the cuts and bruises (cuts and bruises) 
 So tired of defending her life, she could have died 
 Fighting for the lives of her children 
 Oh mother, we're stronger 
 From all of the tears you have shed (all of the tears you have shed) 
 Oh mother, don't look back 
 'Cause he'll never hurt us again (he'll never hurt us again)

 Burying hurt and regret 
 But mama, he'll never touch us again 
 For every time he tried to break you down 
 Just remember who's still around 
 It's over, and we're stronger 
 And we'll never have to go back again 
 Oh mother, we're stronger 
 From all of the tears you have shed

 I could never face 
 Losing you would give my faith 
 In a higher place

 I couldn't breathe without you here 
 What kind of world would I see without you? 
 I can't dream without you here, yeah, oh, yeah

 Ooh, Ooh, Oh 
 If you see me walking down the street 
 Or in the pages of your magzine 
 Looking just a little differently 
 Showing off a softer side of me 
 They saying I'm looking like a lady 
 They saying that love is going to change me 
 But don't be fooled by everything you see 
 Gotta let the naughty in me free 
 There's a woman inside of all of us 
 Who never quite seems to get enough 
 Trying to play by the rules is rough 
 Cause sooner or later something's going to erupt 
 'Cause I still got that nasty in me 
 Still got that dirrty degree (still got it)

 No matter what you thinking of me, still dirrty 
 And if you're still rolling with me, still got it 
 No matter what you thinking of me, still dirrty 
 Still got that freak in me 
 Why is a woman's sexuality 
 Always under so much scrutiny? 
 Why can't she do exactly as she please 
 Without being called a million things? 
 They say I'm not the girl they used to know (used to know) 
 'Cause I don't always wear revealing clothes (oh) 
 But don't be fooled the moment I get home (I get home) 
 I'm letting loose givin' a private show (don't you know) 
 There's some women out there who talk and stare 
 Who never seem to let down their hair 
 Like to past judgement, but they're just scared 
 And don't know what they're missing, so they better beware

 I still got that nasty in me 
 Still got that dirrty degree (oh yeah)

 No matter what you thinking of me, still dirrty 
 Still got that freak in me 
 Don't tell me to behave 
 'Cause I'll never play that game (no) 
 Don't tell me what to do 
 'Cause I'll never be uptight like you 
 Don't look at me that way 
 'Cause I ain't never gonna change 
 And if you're talking about my life 
 You're only wasting your own time 
 If I want to wear lingere outside of my clothes 
 If I want to be erotic in my own videos 
 If I want to be provocative, well that ain't a sin 
 Maybe you're not comfortable in your own skin 
 I still got that nasty in me 
 Still got that dirrty degree (in me)

 Gonna live my life for me 
 I'm gonna get bold, gonna do my own thing 
 We all got a song that we're meant to sing 
 And no matter what people say, or might think 
 I ain't going no place, no I'm here to stay 
 Gonna keep on doing my thing 
 Cause whether they love or they're hatin' on me 
 I'll still be the same girl I used to be

 The wonderment that lies 
 Behind the shimmer and the lights

 Is it all just fun and games? 
 Or is there more behind the makeup, 
 And the faces full of paint? 
 I ask you, do you want to come and play?

 Get the world to come and play

 Welcome to the greatest show 
 Greatest show on earth 
 You've never seen before 
 Here the fairytale unfolds 
 What's behind the smoke and glass? 
 Painted faces, everybody wears a mask 
 Are you selling them your soul? 
 Well you'll be left out in the cold 
 Is it all blue skies 
 Fun and games until you fall 
 Then you're left without anyone at all 
 You're riding on a shooting star 
 With a smile upon your face 
 But soon the shine fades 
 And you're left out all alone 
 Wondering where did they all go? 
 Ooh 
 Been jaded, hated, 
 Who'll be around when the limelight's faded?

 I would hold you in my arms, I would take the pain away 
 Thank you for all you've done, forgive all your mistakes 
 There's nothing I wouldn't do to hear your voice again 
 Sometimes I wanna call you but I know you won't be there 
 Ohoho, I'm sorry for blaming you 
 For everything I just couldn't do 
 And I've hurt myself by hurting you 
 Some days I feel broke inside but I won't admit 
 Sometimes I just wanna hide 'cause it's you I miss 
 And it's so hard to say goodbye 
 When it comes to this, oh 
 Would you tell me I was wrong, would you help me understand? 
 Are you looking down upon me, are you proud of who I am? 
 There's nothing I wouldn't do to have just one more chance 
 To look into your eyes and see you looking back 
 Ohoho, I'm sorry for blaming you 
 For everything I just couldn't do 
 And I've hurt myself, ohoho 
 If I had just one more day 
 I would tell you how much that I've missed you since you've been away

 That in all my loneliness 
 I've forsaken and I've sinned 
 Leaving fragments of a man so broken 
 I could tell you what I've done 
 Or should I tell you where I went wrong? 
 Well the more that I start to play 
 My deceitful, evil ways 
 Keep on growing stronger by the day 
 Oh lord have mercy on my soul 
 For I have walked a sinful road 
 So I'm gonna get down on my knees 
 Beg forgiveness to help set me free 
 Lord have mercy on me, please 
 Mother Mary full of grace 
 In my weakness, I've lost faith 
 I've been careless, and I have been warned 
 And the devil inside me is torn

 So I'm gonna get down on my knees 
 Beg forgiveness to help set me free

 Somehow you're always waiting with your open arms to catch me 
 You're gonna save me from myself, from myself, yes 
 You're gonna save me from myself, ooh, oh yeah

 Well some guys have shown me Aces but you've got that Royal Flush

 'Cause when I start to crumble, you know how to keep me smiling 
 You always save me from myself, from myself, myself 
 You're gonna save me from myself 
 I know it's hard, it's hard 
 But you've broken all my walls 
 You've been my strength, so strong 
 And don't ask me why I love you

 Is what I need to make me 
 A better woman to myself to myself, myself 
 You're gonna save me from my, myself"
96,Christina Aguilera,pop,The Right Man,"So many years have gone by 
 Always strong, tried not to cry 
 Never felt like I needed any man 
 To comfort me in life 
 But I'm all made up today 
 A veil upon my face 
 But no father stands beside me 
 To give his bride away 
 Well I'm standing in the chapel 
 Wearing my white dress 
 I have waited for this moment 
 With tears of happiness 
 Here I leave behind my past 
 By taking the chance 
 I've finally found the right man 
 Thoughts racing fast through my mind 
 As I'm gazing down the aisle 
 That my future will mend the memories 
 Torn between father and child 
 My emotions overload 
 'Cause there is no hand to hold 
 There's no shoulder here to lean on 
 I'm walking all on my own 
 Here I go 
 Now I'm standing at four corners 
 To have and to hold 
 Now my love, you stand beside me 
 To walk life's winding road 
 And I owe it all to you 
 For taking the chance 
 You've shown me there's a right man 
 'Cause I never knew a right man 
 Well I'm standing in the chapel 
 Ready to confess 
 That I've waited for this moment 
 With tears of happiness 
 Now I leave behind my past 
 By taking the chance 
 Oh 
 Well I'm standing at four corners 
 To have and to hold 
 Now my love, you stand beside me 
 To walk life's winding road 
 And I owe it all to you 
 For taking the chance 
 And one day my little girl 
 Will reach out her hand 
 She'll know I found the right man"

105,Christina Aguilera,pop,Elastic Love,"A rubber band is what I call your love for me 
 'Cause it comes and goes and pins me like a trampoline 
 But all this back and forth is freaky, it's confusing me 
 Like a pencil trying to write and you're erasing me 
 If I was a ruler I'll set you straight 
 But your love is like a sharpener, it really grates 
 'Cause when I'm trying to bounce, you pull me back 
 And when I try to come to you, you give me slack 
 Your love is pulling like a rubber band 
 Your love is pulling like a rubber band 
 Elastic love, ever lastic love, ever lusting love 
 Such a spastic love 
 Elastic love, ever lastic love, ever lusting love 
 Such a spastic love 
 La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
 A rubber was an analogy 
 You can even say it's a metaphor 
 The tension between you and me 
 I ain't gonna feel if you let it go 
 I can take a little bit and make it more 
 A little bit of hate can make it war 
 But a lot of love ain't enough 
 And so, I don't really know how we find the cure 
 Elastic love, ever lastic love, ever lusting love 
 Such a spastic love 
 Elastic love, ever lastic love, ever lusting love 
 Such a spastic love 
 Paper clips couldn't even hold us together 
 Paper clips couldn't even hold us together 
 Paper clips couldn't even hold us together 
 Paper clips couldn't even hold us together 
 If we were gaffer tape maybe we could spend the summer 
 You could say your piece, you post it on paper 
 When your love hits, it sticks me like a stapler 
 Elastic love, ever lastic love, ever lusting love 
 Such a spastic love 
 Elastic love, ever lastic love, ever lusting love 
 Such a spastic love 
 Elastic love, ever lastic love, ever lusting love 
 Such a spastic love 
 Elastic love, ever lastic love, ever lusting love 
 Such a spastic love

 I wanna love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, eh 
 Won't let you sleep, I gotta satisfy my needs 
 I need to love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, eh 
 And when the sun rises, there's one thing on my mind 
 I want sex for breakfast, stay inside 
 And even though we made sweet love all night 
 I need sex for breakfast, feels so right 
 Might be late for work, but I promise that it's worth it baby 
 Don't go 
 So hungry for you, taste me and I'll taste you

 And I'm so certain, soon I'm gonna feel your honey drip my juices start to flow 
 Strawberry cream is like a dream, my fantasy is reality 
 When the morning comes, I know that I will too 
 And when the sun rises, there's one thing on my mind 
 I need sex for breakfast, stay inside (oh, oh, stay inside baby) 
 And even though we made sweet love all night 
 I need sex for breakfast, feels so right (it feels so good, inside)

 As the music fades 
 And I'm left here with 
 With more than I can take 
 If you lift me up 
 Just get me through this night 
 I know I'll rest tomorrow 
 And I'll be strong enough to try 
 When the static clears 
 And all is said and done 
 I will realize 
 That we all need someone 
 If you lift me up 
 Just get me through this night 
 I know I'll rest tomorrow 
 And I'll be strong enough to try 
 So when you see me crashing 
 And there's nowhere left to fall 
 Will you lift me even higher 
 To rise above this all 
 If you lift me up 
 If you lift me up 
 Said if you lift me up 
 Will you lift me higher 
 When you see me crashing 
 And there's nowhere left to fall 
 Will you lift me even higher 
 To rise above this all 
 If you lift me up 
 Said if you lift me up 
 If you lift me up 
 Just get me through this night"

 Watching you grow, letting you know you are my only 
 You bring me hope when I can't breathe 
 You give me love, you're all I need 
 Slowly I'm holding you closely 
 You're wrapped in my arms 
 And you're inside me 
 I tell you my fears, telling you everything 
 Telling the truth to you gives me wings 
 Free with my words, free as a bird 
 I am flying high 
 Looking at you, everything new, you are my life 
 You bring me hope when I can't breathe 
 And you give me love, you're all I need 
 Slowly I'm holding you closely 
 So happy to carry you inside me 
 I'll feed you love and I hope it's enough to inspire you through suffering 
 Holding you up

 Babe, you lost me 
 And we tried, oh how we cried 
 We lost ourselves, the love has died 
 And oh, we tried, you can't deny 
 We're left as shells, we lost the fight

 I feel like our world's been infected 
 And somehow you left me neglected 
 We found our life's been changed 
 Babe, you lost me 
 Now I know you're sorry and we were sweet 
 But you chose lust when you deceived me 
 You'll regret it but it's too late

 Watching as the waves roll by it makes me understand 
 What it is to make a life that means a little more 
 Seems so easy to forget what we're all looking for 
 I don't know where I'm going just yet 
 Skipping work and I don't need to excuse it 
 Long as that floating feeling I get in the moment 
 Makes it really worth it 
 Hey, forget about your Monday morning 
 We are never gonna be that boring 
 Hey, forget about your Monday morning 
 So, so ordinary same old story 
 Ey, o, ey, o, ey, o, ey, o, ey, o, ey, o 
 I had a party, it went long, I told 'em all to stay 
 Neighbors calling to complain and rain on our parade 
 They told me to use my head and keep my focus straight 
 Shame on all of you for being stiff and so straight laced 
 Let them keep talking, I don't regret 
 They can't help it, caught up in their mindset

 Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah 
 Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah 
 Girls like you give girls a bad name 
 Trying to get a boy but you sound so lame 
 Thinking it's cute to act real dumb 
 But the jokes on you, you stupid hon 
 Hold up, you're making no sense 
 You're talking out your ass 
 Like a waffle head, you bobblehead 
 Just keep your trap shut like your mamma said 
 Why, oh, why pretend? 
 I know you got a brain, why don't you use it? 
 Why, oh, why pretend? 
 If you so smart, why you act brain dead 
 Hold up, you're making no sense 
 You're talking out your ass 
 Like a waffle head, you bobblehead 
 Just keep your trap shut like your mamma said 
 But wait, like I don't get it 
 He, he, ha I don't care what you looking at[unverified] 
 Body so skinny but your head's so fat 
 Talky, talky, talky but you don't say shit 
 Got a way with words, you give me nothing, bitch 
 Banging on the door, nobody else there 
 You nightmare on Elm Street got everybody scared 
 Making me wanna run when you coming around 
 Because it's a frightening sound 
 Got a way with words, you give me nothing, bitch 
 Banging on the door, nobody else there 
 You nightmare on Elm Street got everybody scared 
 Making me wanna run when you coming around 
 Because it's a frightening sound 
 Hold up, you're making no sense 
 You're talking out your ass 
 Like a waffle head, you bobblehead 
 Just keep your trap shut like your mamma said 
 But wait, like, like what like, like what? 
 I don't get it, like what, what really? 
 And the real girls say I never play dumb 
 To get what I want 
 And always come out the one 
 That's on top"
122,Christina Aguilera,pop,Birds Of Prey,"Suddenly lost inside a fantasy 
 Everything not quite what it seems to be 
 Slipping and falling through the looking glass 
 Catching a glimpse at all that lies behind the masks 
 You disappear with the dawn 
 You only see what you want 
 When you are out with the birds of prey 
 When you are out with the birds of prey 
 They watch and they feed 
 They take what they need 
 They bite as you bleed 
 The birds of prey 
 Taking the blue pill only made you cry 
 And all that the red pill did was make you forget why 
 There is no right, there's no wrong 
 You only see what you want 
 When you are out with the birds of prey 
 When you are out with the birds of prey"
123,Christina Aguilera,pop,Stronger Than Ever,"What you gave me I know you gave me 
 You remind me all the time 
 And how you hurt me and you don't see it 
 Again I am the child 
 And though you tell me that you love me 
 I can't feel it and I'm afraid to let you down 
 It's all or nothing, I fear that something's wrong 
 I'm tired of walking on eggshells so terrified to fail 
 And in order to please you I've abandoned myself 
 And though it used to hurt me when you push me away 
 I'm stronger than ever, you made me this way 
 Mmmh... How I wish you, you suffered less too 
 It tears us both apart 
 And it's not pretty the way you criticize me 
 And how it breaks my heart 
 And though you tell me that you love me 
 I can't feel it and I'm afraid to let you down 
 It's all or nothing, I fear that something's wrong 
 I'm tired of walking on eggshells so terrified to fail 
 And in order to please you I've abandoned myself 
 And though it used to hurt me when you push me away 
 I'm stronger than ever, you made me this way 
 How I wish you knew, how much I need you 
 I feel like running but I can't abandon you 
 You avoid my gaze, withdraw from me these days 
 You punish me for trying to be all that you wanted 
 What more can I do? 
 I'm tired of walking on eggshells so terrified to fail 
 And in order to please you I've abandoned myself 
 And though it used to hurt me when you push me away 
 I'm stronger than ever, you made me this way 
 I'm tired of walking on eggshells so terrified to fail 
 And in order to please you I've abandoned myself 
 And though it used to hurt me when you push me away 
 I'm stronger than ever, you made me this way"

 The galaxy away is not so far 
 Because we know the future is our dark 
 Till the end I'll be waiting 
 Now I lay me down to sleep 
 I pray we'll meet inside my dreams 
 If I should go before I wake 
 I pray our souls will join again

 And what you though was your best decision 
 Just became your worst mistake

 To know that I beat you 
 That I can defeat you 
 Oh how does it feel 
 Cause it sure feels sweeter 
 It sure feels sweeter to me 
 Now that I'm wiser 
 Now that I'm stronger 
 Now that I'm a fighter 
 There's a thousand faces of me 
 And I'm gonna rise up

 I stand and believe in who I am 
 Take shots at my heart but who am I to give up 
 Everybody needs a melody to set their souls free 
 My stage is the greatest in the world 
 Give back to the ones who struggle with me stay true 
 Reminding me to see my only chosen destiny 
 And now I'm ready now I'm gonna sing it all out

 My heart aches 
 As you take 
 And You take 
 Words cut through my skin 
 Tears roll down my chin 
 My walls crumble within 
 But I'll take it all on 
 And get up when I fell 
 Till the last curtain call 
 But you'll never get the best of me 
 No more 
 Said you'll never get the best of me 
 No more 
 Arn't you tired of throwing stones 
 Trying to kick me when I'm down 
 But you'll never get the best of me, no more

 Made of ice 
 Heart of stone 
 Born to fight 
 But I cry 
 I still cry 
 Are you happy 
 To know 
 I'm unhappy alone 
 Take your shot 
 I'm wide open 
 Words cut through my skin 
 Tears roll down my chin 
 My walls crumble within 
 But I'll take it all on

 We light the darkness you and I 
 We are the flicker in the night 
 Never shine so bright 
 We are the strong and though we fall 
 We fought for love we risked it all 
 Never back down against the walls 
 It's what we're living for yeah 
 Keep on rising higher 
 Blaze the room with fire 
 Right down to the wire 
 Rise the fire higher 
 As we stand together 
 Chase our dreams forever, forever, forever, forever 
 Now we have wings we can fly 
 We can be kings you and I 
 Wipe away the tears from our eyes 
 We light up the sky 
 Although the road ahead was long 
 I was too weak to carry on 
 You picked me up you were my home 
 I never stood alone 
 No one can tell us what we want 
 No one can stop us anymore 
 No looking back, we're moving forward 
 No one can take this moment away 
 Keep on rising higher 
 Blaze the room with fire 
 Right down to the wire 
 Rise the fire higher 
 As we stand together 
 Chase our dreams forever, forever, forever, forever 
 Now we have wings we can fly 
 We can be kings you and I 
 Wipe away the tears from our eyes 
 We light up the sky 
 When skies are grey 
 I'll light your way 
 I'll be your shoulder 
 You can lean on me 
 Now we have wings we can fly 
 We can be kings you and I 
 Wipe away the tears from our eyes 
 We light up the sky

 Is they tend to hurt people 
 The funny thing about lies is 
 They're only lies 
 The funny thing about hearts is 
 They tend to break easy 
 The funny thing about healing is 
 I'm alright 
 Your voice is like a knife 
 It used to make me cry 
 You tried to cut my pride 
 Not this time 
 So go ahead and say the things you got to say 
 You know you're only throwing empty words my way 
 Cause you won't break me you won't break me 
 You can't take me down 
 No 
 The funny thing about listening is 
 I don't have to hear you and the 
 Funny thing about talking is your words are tired 
 Now I've come to realise that 
 Life can be cruel but 
 The only approval that I need is mine 
 Your voice is like a knife 
 It used to make me cry 
 You tried to cut my pride 
 Not this time 
 So go ahead and say the things you got to say 
 You know you're only throwing empty words my way 
 Cause you won't break me you won't break me 
 You can't take me down 
 No 
 The hardest part of this 
 Cannot be heard or seen 
 This journey starts when I begin loving me 
 So go ahead and say the things you got to say 
 You know you're only throwing empty words my way 
 Cause you won't break me you won't break me 
 You can't take me down 
 No 
 So go ahead and say the things you got to say 
 You know you're only throwing empty words my way"

 I don't need it anymore 
 Just don't need it, just don't need it

 I make it a policy not to tell anybody to sit down 
 I just still encourage everybody else to stand up 
 I survived the dark ages

 They wanna take my time 
 But I'mma take what's mine 
 Don't play with me 
 They try to use my name 
 Oh, what they wouldn't do for the fame 
 But I ain't you and we ain't the same 
 This ain't a game to me 
 I'm sick of sittin', I'm sick of sittin' 
 I'm sick of sittin', I been workin' too hard to not be livin' 
 I'm sick of sittin', I'm so emancipated

150,Christina Aguilera,pop,Twice,"Sometimes I wonder what is the meaning of this life 
 I found the price of love and lost my mind 
 I will forgive them all of my wrongs and my rights 
 I'd do it all again and won't think twice 
 Oh, think twice 
 Are you devil? Are you angel? 
 Am I heaven? Am I hell? 
 I can barely find the proof to save myself 
 Are you water? Are you fire? 
 Are you filthy? Are you pure? 
 Oh, I thought by now I'd know 
 But I'm not sure 
 Well, you're no angel 
 I never asked you to be 
 You're my danger 'cause that's just what I need 
 But it still hurts me 
 Well, sometimes I wonder what is the meaning of my life 
 I found the price of love and lost my mind 
 I will forgive them all of my wrongs and my rights 
 I'd do it all again and won't think twice 
 Oh, think twice 
 My forever and my end 
 My forgiveness and my sin 
 I have sacrificed the most of my youth 
 Is it treason? Is it true? 
 That the worst I won't undo 
 Only enemy I have in love is you 
 Well, you're no angel 
 I never asked you to be 
 You're my danger 'cause that's just what I need 
 But it still hurts me 
 Well, sometimes I wonder what is the meaning of my life 
 I found the price of love and lost my mind 
 Oh, I will forgive them all of my wrongs and my rights 
 I'd do it all again and won't think twice, no 
 Whoa, think twice 
 Were you devil? Were you angel? 
 It's too late to change my mind 
 I would do it all again and not think twice"

 Never wanted to let down my guard, be vulnerable 
 Never wanted to feel helpless or too comfortable 
 I make it on my own, hey 
 I've been thinking a lot about the way that people change 
 The most beautiful beginnings can go down in flames 
 It's inevitable, and that's what's got me so afraid 
 I'd rather be alone 
 I don't want no white picket fence 
 Dozen roses and a wedding dress 
 Fairy tales are fake happiness 
 But here we are and I must confess 
 Yeah, I'm in over my head feeling confused 
 I'm losing my mind, don't know what to do 
 'Cause I don't want to get married 
 Unless it's with you, unless it's with you 
 You came into my life when I wasn't trying to find 
 Anybody to love, hiding what I felt inside 
 But you opened me up and now I finally realize 
 I'll be your girl for life 
 We don't need a big audience 
 Thousand people we never met 
 Me and you and a couple of friends 
 And here we are and I must confess 
 Yeah, I'm in over my head feeling confused 
 I'm losing my mind, don't know what to do 
 'Cause I don't want to get married 
 Unless it's with you, unless it's with you 
 And oh, I know that it's scary 
 But I know that it's true, I'm saying ""I do"" 
 'Cause I don't want to get married 
 Unless it's with you, unless it's with you 
 Beating heart and trembling hands 
 Take me just the way I am 
 'Cause all that I want is one and the same 
 For the rest of my days, for the rest of my days 
 You can ask me in a hundred years 
 If I would still be standing here 
 When we're old and gray, I'd answer the same 
 Our love will remain, oh, our love will remain 
 Yeah, I was over my head feeling confused 
 Been losing my mind, don't know what to do 
 'Cause I don't want to get married 
 Unless it's with you, unless it's with you

 I'll be right here when your world starts to fall, ooh 
 Young girl, it's all right 
 Your tears will dry, you'll soon be free to fly, ooh 
 When you're safe inside your room, you tend to dream 
 Of a place where nothing's harder than it seems 
 No one ever wants or bothers to explain 
 Of the heartache life can bring and what it means 
 When there's no one else, look inside yourself 
 Like your oldest friend, just trust the voice within 
 Then you'll find the strength that will guide your way 
 You'll learn to begin to trust the voice within, oh 
 Young girl, don't hide 
 You'll never change if you just run away, ooh 
 Young girl, just hold tight 
 Soon you're gonna see your brighter day, ooh 
 Now, in a world where innocence is quickly claimed 
 It's so hard to stand your ground when you are so afraid 
 No one reaches out a hand for you to hold 
 When you're lost outside, look inside to your soul 
 When there's no one else, look inside yourself 
 Like your oldest friend, just trust the voice within 
 Then you'll find the strength that will guide your way 
 If you will learn to begin to trust the voice within 
 Oh yeah, ooh, yeah, oh 
 Life is a journey 
 It can take you anywhere you choose to go 
 As long as you're learning 
 You'll find all, you'll ever need to know 
 Be strong, break it, hold on, you'll make it 
 Be strong, just don't forsake it because 
 No one can tell you what you can't do 
 No one can stop you, you know that I'm talking to you 
 When there's no one else, look inside yourself 
 And like your oldest friend, just trust the voice within 
 Then you'll find the strength that will guide your way 
 You will learn to begin to trust the voice within 
 Young girl, don't cry 
 I'll be right here when your world starts to fall, ooh

157,Christina Aguilera,pop,Abandont,"She sits alone, 
 In the abandont corner, of her room, (oh her room) 
 Lost her life, her lovely past, ooh ooh ooh ooh 
 She used to love, feel and have compation, 
 But now Her life has lead nowhere, nowhere 
 She feels attached, 
 And can't come loose, 
 Like strings holding on, 
 She can't let go, 
 She begs and pleads, 
 As she tries to relase, 
 And falls to her knees 
 What's holding her back? 
 No one has know, 
 Maybe her shadow, 
 The shadow of doom, 
 She is miserable each day, each week 
 While tears begin to run down her cheeks 
 Hoping for her day to come, 
 For her to pry loose, 
 The day has not begun... (o when?) 
 She feels attached, 
 And can't come loose, 
 Like strings holding on, 
 She can't let go, 
 She begs and pleads, 
 As she tries to relase, 
 And falls to her kneeeees (oh Oh) 
 Strings, strings, 
 They hold her back, 
 No one has notcied, 
 Or cared, 
 No one knows, 
 What's she is really like, 
 Deep down inside, 
 Oh What's there to hide? 
 She is nervous, frightened, scared and weak, 
 She must peer or peak from that ... 
 Corner of the room, 
 Open her eyes, and face doom 
 Maybe she has, maybe she did, 
 She woke up one day and saw the light, 
 Her love and compasion, had all faded away, 
 As she ran through her shadow, and began to 
 Beg and plead as she fell to her knees and finally, 
 She broke loose"

 It's 3 in the morning, 
 And baby, I don't have a clue what to do. 
 It's 3 in the morning, 
 And it's time we figured out who was whose. 
 That's all that's going through my mind, 
 The tape of you, the tape of you and her, 
 The tape that brought me to tears, 
 The tape that ruined my life, my world. 
 I miss your smile and your touch, 
 My love for you obviously didn't seem much, 
 When I'm alone the hours go slow, 
 But when I'm with you the time just goes. 
 That's all that's going through my mind, 
 The tape of you, the tape of you and her, 
 The tape that brought me to tears, 
 The tape that ruined my life, my world. 
 I'm hurt, 
 But I've learnt, 
 I'm distraught, 
 But I've been taught, 
 On how, your love, 
 Is going to kill me slowly inside, 
 Ooh! 
 That's all that's going through my mind,

 Didn't know it then but now it couldn't be clearer 
 That I remember being filled with such wonder 
 Before learnin' that the world can be harsher 
 Who you love or the color of your skin 
 Or the place that you were born and grew up in 
 Shouldn't decide how you will be treated 
 'Cause we're all the same when everybody's breathing 
 Waiting for a change to set us free 
 Waiting for the day when you can be you and I can be me 
 Waiting for hope to come around 
 Waiting for the day when hate is lost and love is found 
 Waiting for a change 
 Waiting for a change 
 (Change, change) 
 For all the brave and the souls who went before us 
 Stand tall, be proud and lift your voices 
 Let 'em know who we are and our choices 
 And one day we won't have to sing this chorus 
 Waiting for a change to set us free 
 Waiting for the day when you can be you and I can be me 
 Waiting for hope to come around 
 Waiting for the day when hate is lost and love is found

 My guide out is your voice but I don't hear your calling! 
 I always hear through the grape vine, 
 That you you talk about me all the time. 
 Where do I turn for shelter from this heartbreaking storm. 
 I used to be able to turn to you to keep me safe and warm! 
 But now she came in the picture,

167,Christina Aguilera,pop,Dreamy Eyes,"I'm reaching out to touch you 
 In the middle of the night 
 And I don't know if I've been sleeping 
 But I hold my pillow tight 
 Are you real or are you my 
 Imagination playing games? 
 I can set you free, you'll always be 
 My one eternal flame. 
 Your dreamy eyes, 
 They just won't say goodbye 
 Well, it must be my faith 
 'Cause I just can't escape 
 And the passion never dies... 
 Oh, dreamy eyes 
 No matter how I cry 
 I just can't reach you 
 Dreamy eyes 
 You're a vision of tomorrow 
 And a ghost from yesterday 
 And I've been trying not to let you 
 Take my breath away. 
 You're a summer breeze that comes and goes 
 But somehow lingers on 
 Tell me how can I forget you 
 If you've never really gone? 
 Your dreamy eyes 
 They just won't say goodbye 
 Well, it must be my faith 
 'Cause I just can't escape 
 And the passion never dies... 
 Oh, dreamy eyes 
 No matter how I cry 
 I just can't reach you 
 Dreamy eyes. 
 What do I have to do 
 To get that close to you and your... 
 Your dreamy eyes 
 They just won't say goodbye 
 Well, it must be my faith 
 'Cause I just can't escape 
 And the passion never dies... 
 Oh, I tried so hard to release you 
 But no matter how I cry 
 I just keep seeing through 
 Dreamy eyes."
168,Christina Aguilera,pop,El Último Adios,"Se quebró la calma 
 El silencio en ruido se volvió 
 Quedaron desnudos 
 Nuestra imagen y nuestro dolor 
 Se mezclaba el cielo 
 Junto con la calle y el rencor 
 Nos llenó de miedo 
 Donde fué el amor? 
 Dime si el dolor despierta el alma 
 Dime si es capaz de despertar el corazón 
 Ni todo el rencor ni la venganza 
 Nos va a poder calmar las ganas 
 De ver de nuevo aquellas caras 
 Dime si el dolor abre una puerta 
 Dime si es capaz de despertar el corazón 
 Juzga tú señor a quien tu quieras 
 Quien iba a pensar 
 Que esa mañana era el último adios 
 Nadie va a cambiarnos 
 Nadie nos va ser perder la fé 
 Nadie va a callarnos 
 Nuestra fuerza vuelve a renacer 
 Hoy me siento libre 
 Estamos unidos por amor 
 Hoy todo ha cambiado 
 Creo mas en tí 
 Dime si el dolor despierta el alma 
 Dime si es capaz de despertar el corazón 
 Ni todo el rencor ni la venganza 
 Nos va a poder calmar las ganas 
 De ver de nuevo aquellas caras 
 Dime si el dolor despierta el alma 
 Dime si es capaz de despertar el corazón 
 Juzga tú señor a quien tu quieras 
 Quien iba a pensar 
 Que esa mañana era el último adios"

 I wanna know when what you've done 
 Could you come face to face with me 
 Isn't it strange

 It really don't make any difference now to me 
 If you don't like what you see 
 I pay no mind to the negative kind 
 'Cause that's just no way to be 
 I don't stop to please someone else's needs 
 Gonna live my life for me 
 I'm gonna keep on, I'm a do my own thing

 I'll still be the same girl I used to be 
 'Cause I ain't going no place, no, I'm here to stay 
 I'm here to stay, I'm here to stay 
 I've never been the type to be shy 
 I know that some would say I'm too headstrong 
 But I'd rather be a woman who voices her mind 
 Whether you think I'm right or wrong 
 And I know some people wanna criticize 
 Makes 'em feel better about themselves 
 So say what you will, time will reveal 
 In the end that I will be here still 
 I'm gonna keep on, I'm a do my own thing

 If I keep stepping it up, I'ma prove it 
 I'm never gonna be stopped, like it or not 
 Gotta get up, keep my head up 
 Gonna keep on turning it up, never let up 
 If I keep stepping it up, I'ma prove it 
 I'm never gonna be stopped, like it or not 
 No matter the pressures that face me 
 I believe, I believe they will see 
 I'll never let anyone break me 
 All your doubt can do now is strengthen me 
 And life, it ain't always that easy 
 Gotta fight to see past the boundaries 
 Crossing the lines I will define 
 Every time that forever is mine 
 I'm gonna keep on, I'm a do my own thing 
 We all got a song that we're meant to sing 
 And no matter what people say or might think

 You and I forever 
 Forever in mane 
 Forever in the sky even in the rain 
 We will last forever 
 I will not forget, I feel your pain 
 When you come to my house 
 And we talk and talk and talk 
 I will cherish every word 
 When we walk at night in the park 
 I will always mark

181,Christina Aguilera,pop,Memories,"When was the last time 
 You called me on the phone? 
 Said you love me 
 And said you needed me 
 When was it? Oh baby 
 It was yesterday 
 That I could hide in your arms 
 You spoke those those lovely words 
 That you want me 
 Was that true? I wanna know 
 I never knew a love so true so pure so innocent 
 But all I have left is sadness and misery 
 Those fond memories have left me 
 Stripped and I'm in agony 
 So why you do this to me? 
 It seems like I've trusted you 
 Broken and torn are my heart when I finally see 
 You and her staying around that corner 
 Whispers of love have left me so alone 
 Did you truly love me? 
 Just the other day 
 I saw another her 
 She 'n' you in a bus sharing every pleasant thing in the world 
 I was so emotional I wanted to see you so much 
 But now it seems that all is gone 
 I guess I must move on 
 I never knew a love so true so pure so innocent 
 But all I have left is sadness and misery 
 Those fond memories have left me 
 Stripped and I'm in agony 
 So why you do this to me? 
 How can a boy like you act like a man? 
 Come back my darlin' and I'll gif you all the happiness 
 I love you 
 You know it's true 
 Come back please come back..."
182,Christina Aguilera,pop,My Funny Valentine,"Be hold the way our fine feathered friend 
 His virtue doth parade 
 Thou knowest not my dim witted friend 
 The picture thou hast made 
 Thy vacant brow and thy tousled hair 
 Conceal thy good intent 
 Thou noble upright, truthful, sincere 
 And slightly dopey gent 
 You're my funny valentine 
 Sweet comic valentine 
 You make me smile with my heart 
 Your looks are laughable 
 Unphotographable 
 Yet you're my favorite work of art 
 Is your figure less than greek 
 Is your mouth a little weak 
 When you open it to speak 
 Are you smart? 
 But don't change a hair for me 
 Not if you care for me 
 Stay little valentine stay 
 Each day is valentine's day!"

184,Christina Aguilera,pop,Not Hurting Any More,"Not hurting any more 
 Yo here we go 
 You left the door wide open 
 It was getting cold 
 You never came home last night 
 And I was upset 
 Feeling lonely and old 
 So I wept and cried 
 You have cheated and lied 
 All I wanted was to be with you 
 But you wouldn't have it 
 You left me alone 
 And I got used to it 
 And now I'm not hurting anymore 
 I screamed and I tried 
 To get hold of myself 
 Get a grip girl 
 Because you need a new life 
 And all I wanted was you 
 But you were with your friends 
 And that's were it ends 
 All I wanted was to be with you 
 But you wouldn't have it 
 You left me alone 
 And I got used to it 
 And now I'm not hurting anymore 
 I'm preparing to run away 
 I've packed my bags 
 And I'm ready to go 
 Then I see you 
 And I stay 
 All I wanted was to be with you 
 But you wouldn't have it 
 You left me alone 
 And I got used to it 
 And now I'm not hurting anymore 
 All I wanted was to be with you 
 But you wouldn't have it 
 You left me alone 
 And I got used to it 
 And now I'm not hurting anymore"
185,Christina Aguilera,pop,Primer Amor,"Yo te contaré, una historia 
 De como, un puertoriqueño me robó el corazón 
 Nunca más he vuelto a amar de esa manera

 Un bailarín 
 Juntos nos perdimos en el ritmo del amor 
 Así es como comenzó"
186,Christina Aguilera,pop,Reflection (Remix),"Look at me, look at me... 
 Look at me 
 You may think you see 
 Who I really am 
 But you'll never know me 
 Everyday 
 It's as if I play a part 
 Now I see 
 If I wear a mask 
 I can fool the world 
 But I cannot fool my heart 
 Who is that girl I see 
 Staring straight back at me 
 When will my reflection show 
 Who I am inside 
 I am now in a world 
 Where I have to hide my heart 
 And what I believe in 
 But somehow 
 I will show the world 
 What's inside my heart 
 And be loved for who I am 
 Who is that girl I see 
 Staring straight back at me 
 Why is my reflection someone I don't know 
 Must I pretend that I'm 
 Someone else for all time 
 When will my reflection show 
 Who I am inside 
 There's a heart that must be 
 Free to fly 
 That burns with a need to know 
 The reason why 
 Wwhy must we all conseal 
 What we think how we feel 
 Must there be a secret me 
 I'm forced to hide 
 I won't pretend that I'm 
 Some one else for all time 
 When will my reflection show 
 Who I am inside 
 When will my reflection show 
 Who I am inside... Who I am inside"
187,Christina Aguilera,pop,Remember,"I remember that time when I first laid eyes on you 
 I looked into your eyes and I knew all my dreams would come true with you 
 Then you left last summer and rest of your family 
 And you left me here all alone for the rest of eternity 
 It's not easy to move on and it's certainly not easy to 
 Be as strong as you'd like to be 
 Because you left me here with only one memory 
 How could ya do it how could ya leave knowing what you've done 
 How could stand blaming for what I have done 
 What I have done 
 It was a cold night and I was at home crying over you my 
 Friends were there to calm me and I got up and I jumped 
 Over the balcony 
 I ... 
 I blame you my... my friends do to 
 It was all... all because of you 
 Because you left me to find someone new"
188,Christina Aguilera,pop,Scar,"No matter where I go, you're always there, 
 No matter where I look, I feel your stare, 
 I thought it was forgotten, or at least forgiven, 
 You're gonna keep punishing me till the day I leave him. 
 I'm not unfaithful, I just couldn't resist love, 
 I can't stay where I'm not getting enough, 
 I trusted my instincts (for happiness) but they turned out untrue, 
 It's my instincts (not me) to blame for hurting you. 
 You seem unwilling to put it in the past, 
 You're trying so hard to stop my love from lasting. 
 Stop! take a minute and look at me, 
 You want to be my lover not my enemy. 
 No matter where I go, you're always there, 
 No matter where I look, I feel your stare, 
 I thought it was forgotten, or at least forgiven, 
 You're gonna keep punishing me till the day I leave him."

192,Christina Aguilera,pop,Star Spangled Banner,"Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light 
 What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming? 
 Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight, 
 O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming? 
 And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, 
 Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. 
 Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave 
 O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave? 
 On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep, 
 Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes, 
 What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep, 
 As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses? 
 Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam, 
 In full glory reflected now shines in the stream: 
 'Tis the star-spangled banner! Oh long may it wave 
 O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave! 
 And where is that band who so vauntingly swore 
 That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion, 
 A home and a country should leave us no more! 
 Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution. 
 No refuge could save the hireling and slave 
 From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave: 
 And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave 
 O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave! 
 Oh! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand 
 Between their loved home and the war's desolation! 
 Blest with victory and peace, may the heav'n rescued land 
 Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation. 
 Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just, 
 And this be our motto: ""In God is our trust."" 
 And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave 
 O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!"

 Can't go wrong 'cause I'm in right 
 It's for sure, not for maybe 
 That I'm all dressed up tonight 
 Steppin' out with my honey 
 Can't be bad to feel so good 
 Never felt quite so sunny 
 And I keep on knockin' wood 
 There'll be smooth sailin' 'cause I'm trimmin' my sails 
 With my top hat and my white tie and my tails 
 Steppin' out with my baby 
 Can't go wrong 'cause I'm in right 
 Ask me when will the day be 
 The big day may be tonight. 
 If I seem to scintillate 
 It's because I've got a date 
 A date with a package of 
 The good things that come with love 
 You don't have to ask me 
 I won't waste your time 
 But if you should ask me 
 Why I feel sublime, go 
 There'll be smooth sailin' 'Cause I'm trimmin' my sails 
 In my top hat and my white tie and my tails

 If I kissed your lips for the last time 
 Please don't say if it's so 
 Tell my heart it's not goodbye 
 And do this one thing for me 
 Make up some stupid story tonight 
 It's all right, keep your truth and tell me lies 
 Something's not right, love is nowhere in sight 
 I'm not ready to let go, it's not time 
 How cruel could you be? 
 Do say it's through least not to me 
 I'm better off, leave it a mystery 
 'Cause I don't wanna know 
 If I kissed your lips for the last time 
 Please don't say if it's so 
 Tell my heart it's not goodbye 
 And do this one thing for me 
 Make up some stupid story tonight 
 It's all right, keep your truth and tell me lies 
 Don't tell me you're leaving 
 There's only so much I can take 
 It's easier if you're faking 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh whoa 
 'Cause I don't wanna know 
 If I kissed your lips for the last time 
 Please don't say if it's so 
 Tell my heart it's not goodbye 
 And do this one thing for me 
 Make up some stupid story 
 Can we keep pretending 
 This is not the ending tonight 
 It's all right, keep your truth and tell me lies

 On Mary's lap is sleeping 
 Whom angels greet with anthem sweet 
 While shepherds watch are keeping 
 This is Christ the Lord 
 Whom shepherds guard and angels sing 
 Haste, haste to bring him laud 
 The babe, the son of Mary 
 Why lies he in such mean estate 
 Where ox and ass are feeding 
 Good Christian fear, for sinners here 
 The silent Word is pleading 
 This is Christ the Lord 
 Whom shepards guard and angels sing 
 Haste, haste to bring him laud 
 The babe, the son of Mary 
 So bring Him incense, gold, and myrh 
 Come peasant king to own Him 
 The King of Kings, salvation brings 
 Let loving hearts enthrone Him 
 This is Christ the Lord 
 Whom shepherds guard and angels sing 
 Haste, haste to bring him laud 
 The babe, the son of Mary"

 When our children can't play 
 Homeless can't eat 
 There's got to be a better way 
 What's going on 
 When we politically blind 
 Can't see the signs of endangered times 
 What's going on 
 Nelly Furtado: 
 What's goin' on in the world today. 
 I'd rather be dead than to turn my head away 
 We got this first world vision too 
 Comfy to lift up our hands in the air 
 And cry for a switch 
 Michael Stipe: 
 Father, father 
 P Diddy: 
 Father help us, come on 
 Michael Stipe: 
 Everybody thinks we're wrong 
 Alicia Keys: 
 Oh, but who are they to judge us 
 Together we can all be strong 
 P Diddy: 
 United we stand, United we fall 
 JC Chasez (From N'Sync): 
 Oh you know we've got to find a way 
 Mary J. Blige: 
 To bring some understanding here today 
 Justin Timberlake (From N'Sync): 
 Barricades can't block our way 
 Darren Hayes (From Savage Garden): 
 Don't punish me with brutality 
 Nsync: 
 Baby talk to me 
 So you can see 
 (Second chorus) 
 Yeah, what's going on 
 Hey, what's going on 
 Somebody tell me what's going on 
 I'll tell you what's goin' on-uh 
 Nelly: 
 What's going on 'cross seas 
 Every minute a child dies by this disease 
 In record numbers indeed 
 Got momma's crying out please 
 My baby hold on 
 My child ain't done nothing wrong 
 Still I want to holler 
 Ask them why they don't bother 
 Oh no, oh no 
 Make me turn to my father 
 And ask him why they all got a trapped soul 
 Nas: 
 I can feel what was bothering Marvin 
 Why his words forever remain 
 Dealing with these modern day problems 
 'Cause of ignorance surrounding me and my constituents 
 Too many infected 
 Too many lives diminishing 
 Nobody say Protestants, Jews, Blacks, and Whites, Latinos and 
 Asians 
 Pray together 
 Less fight 
 We better unite 
 As genocide chemical war 
 And the rich and the poor 
 Know that God delivers a cure 
 Eve: 
 It's a shame our reality is devastating 
 People praying for a cure 
 Dying while they're waiting 
 Ask the Lord for the comfort and strength to face it 
 All the kids with dreams 
 Won't get the chance to chase it 
 Makes me sad 
 Think about the lives they would've had 
 Think about the orphan babies got no moms and dads 
 How can we sit back and not try to make it right 
 We gotta come together 
 We gotta fight for life 
 Fred Durst (From Limp Bizkit): 
 Somebody tell me what's going on 
 (What's going on) 
 We got human beings using humans for a bomb 
 But everyone wanna live 
 Don't nobody really want to die 
 You feeling me right 
 I can't be watching people die 
 (Die) 
 And watching people cry 
 Let me break it down for a minute 
 If there's enough room here for you and me 
 There's plenty of room for some humanity 
 Somebody tell me what's going on 
 (What's going on) 
 Somebody tell me what's going on 
 (What's going on) 
 Somebody tell me what's going on 
 (What's going on) 
 Somebody tell me what's going on 
 (What's going on) 
 Somebody tell me what's going on 
 (What's going on) 
 Somebody tell me what's going on 
 (What's going on) 
 Somebody tell me what's going on 
 (What's going on) 
 Somebody tell me what's going on 
 (What's going on)"
