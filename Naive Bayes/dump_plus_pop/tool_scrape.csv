 Your head was almost empty. 
 It always hurt you when you woke up like this. 
 You crawled up out of your ditch unto your gravel road 
 And you began to walk 
 And waited for the rest of your mind to come back to you. 
 You could see the car parked far down the road 
 And you walked toward it. 
 If God is our father, you thought, 
 Then Satan must be our cousin. 
 Why didn't anyone else understand these important things? 
 When you got to your car, 
 You tried all the doors, 
 But they were locked. 
 It was a red car and it was new. 
 There was an expensive leather camera case laying on the seat. 
 Out across your field 
 You could see two tiny people walking by your woods. 
 You began to walk towards them.

 He had a lot of nothing to say 
 We'll miss him 
 We'll miss him 
 We are gonna miss him 
 We are gonna miss him 
 Yeah, so long 
 We wish you well 
 Told us how you weren't afraid to die 
 Well, so long 
 Don't cry 
 Or feel too down 
 Not all martyrs see divinity 
 But at least you tried 
 Standing above the crowd 
 He had a voice that was strong and loud 
 We'll miss him 
 We'll miss him 
 Ranting and pointing his finger 
 At everything but his heart 
 We'll miss him 
 We'll miss him 
 We are gonna miss him 
 We are gonna miss him 
 There's no way 
 To recall 
 What it was that you had said to me 
 Like I care at all 
 But it was so loud 
 You sure could yell 
 Took a stand on every little thing 
 And so loud 
 You could be the one who saves me from my own existence 
 ""I was so sure I'd sin and you'd fall down too"" 
 ""I'm too smart when you're invisible by the bone and the symbol on you. 
 So he bashes his skull through the window while over looking the sea. 
 Twilight amber ego. 
 We were amused by this"" 
 Yeah, standing above the crowd 
 He had a voice that was strong and loud and I 
 Swallowed his facade 'cause I'm so 
 Eager to identify 
 With someone above the ground 
 Someone who seemed to feel the same 
 Someone prepared to lead the way and 
 Someone who would die for me 
 Will you? 
 Will you now? 
 Would you die for me? 
 Don't you fuckin' lie 
 Don't you step outta line 
 Don't you step outta line 
 Don't you step outta line 
 Don't you fuckin' lie 
 You've claimed all this time 
 That you would die for me 
 Why then are you so surprised 
 When you hear your own eulogy? 
 He had a lot to say 
 He had a lot of nothing to say 
 He had a lot to say 
 He had a lot of nothing to say 
 Come down 
 Get off your fuckin' cross 
 We need the fuckin' space 
 To nail the next fool martyr 
 To ascend, you must die 
 You must be crucified 
 For our sins and our lies 
 Goodbye"

 What's holding up is a mirror 
 What's singing songs is a snake... it is 
 Looking to turn my piss to wine 
 They're both totally void of hate 
 And killing me just the same now 
 The snake behind me hisses 
 What my damage could have been 
 My blood before me begs me 
 Open up my heart again 
 And I feel this coming over like a storm again... now 
 Considerately

 Drains me, bleeds me 
 Leaves me cracked and empty 
 Drags me down like some sweet gravity 
 The snake behind me hisses 
 What my damage could have been 
 My blood before me begs me 
 Open up my heart again 
 And I feel this coming over like a storm again... now

 To slip away or fade away 
 Daze away, I still feel you 
 Touching me, changing me 
 And... considerately killing me 
 Considerately killing me 
 And... considerately killing me 
 Considerately killing me 
 And... 
 Without the skin peeled 
 Beneath the storm 
 Under these tears now 
 The walls came down 
 As the snake is drowned 
 As I look in his eyes 
 My fear begins to fade 
 Recalling all of the times 
 I could have cried... then 
 I should have cried... then 
 And as the walls come down 
 And as I look in your eyes 
 My fear begins to fade 
 Recalling all of the times 
 I have died and will die 
 It's all right 
 I don't mind 
 I don't mind 
 I don't mind! 
 I am too connected to you 
 To slip away or fade away 
 Daze away, I still feel you

 My old muscles looking for a clue 
 I've been crawling on my belly 
 Clearing out what could've been 
 I've been wallowing in my own confused and 
 Insecure delusions 
 For a piece to cross me over 
 Or a word to guide me in 
 I wanna feel the changes coming down 
 I wanna know what I've been hiding 
 In my shadow

 Feel the outside turning in 
 I wanna feel the metamorphosis and 
 Cleansing I've endured in

 Change is coming 
 Now is my time 
 Listen to my muscle memory 
 Contemplate what I've been clinging to 
 Forty six & 2 ahead of me 
 I choose to live and to grow 
 Take and give and to move 
 Learn and love and to cry 
 Kill and die and to be 
 Paranoid and to lie 
 Hate and fear and to do 
 What it takes to move through 
 I choose to live and to lie 
 Kill and give and to die 
 Learn and love and to do 
 What it takes to step through 
 See my shadow changing 
 Stretching up and over me 
 Soften this old armor 
 Hoping I can clear the way by 
 Stepping through my shadow 
 Coming out the other side 
 Step into the shadow 
 Forty six & 2 just ahead of me"

28,Tool,metal,Think For Yourself (Third Eye Intro),"(Timothy Leary speaking) 
 Think for yourself 
 Question authority 
 Throughout human history, as our species has faced the frightening 
 Terrorizing fact that we do not know who we are, or where we are going in 
 This ocean of chaos, it has been the authorities, the political, the 
 Religious, the educational authorities who attempted to comfort us by 
 Giving us order, rules, regulations, informing, forming in our minds their 
 View of reality. To think for yourself you must question authority and 
 Learn how to put yourself in a state of vulnerable, open-mindedness 
 Chaotic, confused, vulnerability, to inform yourself 
 Think for yourself

 I may find peace within the emptiness. How pitiful.

 It's calling me. 
 And in my darkest moment, feeble and weeping; 
 The Moon tells me a secret - my confidant: 
 ""As full and bright as I am, this light is not my own, and 
 A million light reflections pass over me. 
 Its source is bright and endless, 
 She resuscitates the hopeless; 
 Without her we are lifeless satellites drifting."" 
 And as I pull my head out I am without one doubt: 
 Don't want to be down here, soothing my narcissism; 
 I must crucify the ego before it's far too late 
 I pray the light lifts me out before I pine away. 
 Before I pine away. 
 So crucify the ego before it's far too late 
 To leave behind this place so negative and blind and cynical 
 And you will come to find that we are all one mind 
 Capable of all that's imagined and all conceivable 
 Just let the light touch you and let the words spill through 
 Just let them pass right through, bringing out our hope and reason. 
 Before we pine away."

 Gather, place, erase 
 So shelter turns to home

 Here we have a stone 
 Throw to stay the stranger 
 Swore to crush his bones 
 Move by will alone 
 Spark becomes a flame 
 Flame becomes a fire 
 Light the way or warm 
 This home we occupy 
 Spark becomes a flame 
 Flame becomes a fire 
 Forge a blade to slay the stranger 
 Take whatever we desire 
 Move by will alone

 Move by will alone 
 Leave as we come in 
 Pure as light 
 Return to one

53,Tool,metal,Right In Two,"Angels on the sideline 
 Puzzled and amused 
 Why did Father give these humans free will? 
 Now they're all confused 
 Don't these talking monkeys know that Eden has enough to go around? 
 Plenty in this holy garden, silly monkeys 
 Where there's one, you're bound to divide it right in two 
 Angels on the sideline 
 Baffled and confused 
 Father blessed them all with reason 
 And this is what they choose? 
 Monkey killing monkey killing monkey over pieces of the ground 
 Silly monkeys 
 Give them thumbs they forge a blade 
 And where there's one they're bound to divide it right in two 
 Right in two 
 Monkey killing monkey killing monkey over pieces of the ground 
 Silly monkeys 
 Give them thumbs, they make a club to beat their brother down 
 How they've survived so misguided is a mystery 
 Repugnant is a creature who would squander the ability 
 To lift an eye to heaven, conscious of his fleeting time here 
 Gotta divide it all right in two 
 Gotta divide it all right in two 
 Gotta divide it all right in two 
 Gotta divide it all right in two 
 Fight 'til they die over sun, over sky 
 They fight 'til they die over sea, over air 
 They fight 'til they die over blood, over love 
 They fight 'til they die over words, polarizing 
 Angels on the sideline again 
 Benched along with patience and reason 
 Angels on the sideline again 
 Wondering where this tug of war will end 
 Gotta divide it all right in two 
 Gotta divide it all right in two 
 Gotta divide it all right in two 
 Right in two 
 Right in two"

 I've got the demons within

 Cleaner who saves the day 
 I get the backwall 
 And important they'll always stay 
 Yeah, yeah... 
 If only one thing that you know 
 Imposters from the show 
 They'll try to trick you into 
 Normal treatment 
 Oh don't you listen to them say 
 Shush them all away

 Madman so 
 I am the freedom cleaner 
 Standing naked here to say 
 I'm the only way..."

 Like a dog in heat 
 Tell it's me by the clamor now, baby 
 I like to tear up the street 
 And I been smokin' for so long 
 Ya know I'm here to stay 
 Got you in a stranglehold, baby 
 You best get outta the way 
 Road I cruise is a bitch now baby 
 But no, you can't turn me round 
 And if a house gets in my way, baby 
 Ya know I'm tearing it down 
 You ran the night that you left me 
 You put me in my place 
 I got you in a stranglehold, baby 
 Then I crushed your face. 
 Sometimes you wanna start higher 
 And sometimes you gotta start low 
 Some people think they gonna die someday 
 I got news, ya never got to go 
 C'mon, c'mon up... 
 C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon baby

 To feel inspired to fathom the power, to witness the beauty 
 To bathe in the fountain 
 To swing on the spiral 
 To swing on the spiral 
 To swing on the spiral of our divinity and still be a human 
 With my feet upon the ground I lose myself between the sounds and open wide to suck it in; 
 I feel it move across my skin 
 I'm reaching up and reaching out; I'm reaching for the random or what ever will bewilder me 
 What ever will bewilder me 
 And following our will and wind we may just go where no one's been 
 We'll ride the spiral to the end and may just go where no one's been
