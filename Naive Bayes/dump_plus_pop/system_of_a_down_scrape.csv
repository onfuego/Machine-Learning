 I got pictures on my mind, 
 I got pictures on my mind. 
 Circumvent your thick ego, 
 Wooden farts, they're on the go, 
 You can't tell me that I'm real, 
 I got pictures on my mind, 
 I got pictures on my mind, 
 I got pictures on my mind, 
 I got pictures on my mind. 
 Fear waits, for us, 
 When the present can't be sealed, 
 Away, gold dust, 
 Now the dishes can be cleared. 
 Fear waits, for us, 
 Till the moment is revealed, 
 Then turns to rust 
 For the mighty conquered meal. 
 Can't you look at my shaved ass, 
 Ounce is gone, and God is once, 
 You can't see me suddenly, 
 I got pictures on my mind, 
 I got pictures on my mind, 
 I got pictures on my mind, 
 I got pictures on my mind.

 I've forgotten to, The road keeps moving clouds, 
 The clouds become unreal, 
 I guess I'll always be at home, 
 Do you want me to try, 
 Directing your night, 
 An exit lights the sky, 
 The sky becomes complete, 
 Traveling hearts divide the throne, 
 I've forgotten to, 
 Friction, lines, bumps, 
 The highway song complete, 
 The signs are all turning right, 
 Do you want me to try, 
 Directing your night, 
 Want me to try, 
 Directing your light,

 Our days are never coming back, 
 The cannons of our time,

 Debemos pedir al todo poderoso

 para as construir una nacion 
 donde reine el sk8 y  el amor. 
 Ahora entramos a la parte algo tablistica 
 eso si sin mucha logistica. 
 Somos un grupo como de hermanos 
 cuando alguien cae se le tiende la mano. 
 Pero quienes somos....... 
 Si no eres tan demente y miras fijamente 
 te podras dar de cuenta que somos 
 la diarrea candente. 
 Un grupo bien formado 
 con todo y un nombre 
 lo unico que nos falta 
 es el uniforme 
 En este grupo ya hay de  todo 
 desde un tonton hasta un falton 
 ese falton soy yo ya que a veces no voy 
 y ya la cojieron conmmigo diciendome falton boy 
 Volvemos al tema de la violencia 
 ya que algunos actuan con negligencia 
 son esos del gobierno aqui la gente muere(y gatillando) 
 y ellos se la pasan pero paseando 
 pero menos mal el 7 de agosto 
 se le acabo el reinadito a don pastranita 
 que ya nos tenia hasta la nuquita. 
 Esperamos que le vaya bien a Uribe 
 y que siempre nos diga todo bien como el pibe

 Do you try to bow for the gift of your day, 
 Then you cede to the morning sun. 
 Pretending that we live doesn't make us alive. 
 Life is a story, 
 Go ahead and find your sight. 
 But to live means to be here, 
 In the present, now, 
 Do you try to bow for the gift of your day, 
 Then you cede to the morning sun. 
 Pretending that we see doesn't give us the sight 
 Pretending that we live doesn't make us alive. 
 What is it that makes us lose sight, 
 True sight, of what is real and essential? 
 I'll take organised patterns of chaos 
 Over the chaotic organisations of man, any day. 
 Pretending that we see doesn't give us the sight 
 Pretending that we live doesn't make us alive. 
 Pretending that we see doesn't give us the sight 
 Pretending that we live doesn't make us alive. 
 The patterns in the carpet do add up though, 
 You don't have to count. 
 The patterns in the carpet do add up though, 
 You don't have to count."

 Believing, then dealing, appeasing the power struggle 
 We're left with no arms right in the power struggle

 Chasing a clown

 And loving without a doubt 
 Embracing friends and 
 Embarrasing foes, 
 And those who are unjust. 
 A man true to his heart 
 Without fear or misgivings 
 With ""insecurity"" tattooed across his body 
 The first to accept, the last to dissapoint 
 He understood all and expected nothing 
 Now you are free 
 Free to roam in the skies 
 Now and then visit me 
 With your starlit eyes

 With your smile, 
 And left a legacy untold 
 You conquered life and fear, 
 So you see there was no room for you to grow old 
 Now you are free 
 Free to roam in the skies

 It's raining in the dark but meantime 
 South of the river you stop and you hold everything

 Now you step inside you don't see too many faces 
 Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down

 Invade countries just for oil

 Let they man get struck, never strike back 
 Stay in the street, seven days a week 
 Shit get hot, you never blaze your heat 
 Stupid motherfucker wanna play me sweet 
 So I keep 'em on his toes, that way he never sleeps 
 Bigger than the king and the Pope, sling no dope 
 Call me anything but broke 
 When it's on, I guarantee my team don't choke 
 Want a war, you niggas better bring yo' force 
 And when I say we won't quit, believe this shit 
 When I talk about a Benz, let you see the 6 
 And when I'm talkin' to a ho, let you meet my bitch 
 When Puff talk, you niggas take heed to this

 Yo, if you down to act, we came to scrap 
 We beef '89, still watch your back 
 A nigga smack me, I'mma smack 'em back 
 If it lead to the guns, then that be that 
 And lately, niggas that snake me, just make me 
 Wanna send 'em heat without AC 
 Thinks I'm sweet, taste me 
 How much you really want it? 
 Enough to put a mil' on it or your deal on it? 
 This year Cancun, guess who I'm going wit 
 My own niggas, see I pay my own trip 
 Make my own chips, I copped my own 6 
 I knock my own shit, like I'm on my own dick 
 My day be short, need coke, raid the fort 
 I'm knocked by the cops, come blaze the court 
 And though niggas die for, go on the shelf 
 Disrespect and spend like a man below your belt 
 Me, I always had, so I never go for self 
 Had thousand dollar bills with Teddy Roosevelt 
 Better slow down, tellin' you now, put the dough down 
 Kick your door down, surround the block 
 Where you go now? 
 Fifty shots spit at you and that is not a whole round 
 Way I leave the furniture, think it was co-found 
 Here's the low-down, messin' with Mase gotta go down 
 What more could I say but hey, guess you niggas know now

 Lil' Kim spread like syphilis 
 You think I'm pussy? 
 I dare you to stick your dick in this 
 Chrome 4-4, inconspicuous in the 6-0-0, shit's ridiculous 
 Speak when you're spoken to and only with permission 
 Like E.F. Hutton, when I talk, niggas listen 
 So don't y'all be mad at me, 'cause I'm the Q to the B 
 To the motherfuckin' E-E 
 Copped my CD, now all y'all wanna be me 
 See me on the TV, beds will dip in 3-D 
 Peep the CD, chromed out and phoned out 
 My shit is paid for, your shit is loaned out 
 I gets it on, money keep growin' 
 Ice fully glowin', plus I'm bad to the bone 
 In the danger zone, I hold my own when the pain is gone 
 Like a splinter I enter 
 So why should I throw my blows in those 
 Do a bit upstate and take the weight for your troubles 
 My nigga B.I.G, I'mma ride for 
 But it ain't too many niggas that I'd die for
