 Bring the 707 out 
 Bring the seven 
 Two puffs for the lady who be down for that 
 Whatever, together 
 Bring your own stash of the greatest, trade it 
 Roll a dub, burn a dub, cough a dub, taste it 
 Then, watch us chase it 
 With a handful of pills, no chasers 
 Jaw clenching on some super-sized papers 
 And she bad in a head band 
 Escaping, her van is a Wonderland 
 And it's half-past six 
 Weed's nice 'cause time don't exist 
 And when the stars shine back to the crib 
 Superstar lines back at the crib 
 And we can test out the tables 
 We got some brand new tables 
 All glass and it's four feet wide 
 But it's a must to get us ten feet high 
 She give me sex in a handbag 
 I got her wetter than a wet nap 
 And no closed doors 
 So I listen to her moans echo 
 ""I heard he do drugs now"" 
 You heard wrong I been on them for a minute, we just never act a fool 
 That's just how we fuckin' livin' 
 And when we act a fool, it's probably 'cause we mixed it 
 Yeah I'm always on that okey dokey 
 Them white boys know the deal, ain't no fuckin' phony 
 Big O know the deal, he the one who showed me 
 Watch me ride this fucking beat like he fuckin' told me 
 ""Is that your girl, what's her fucking story?"" 
 ""She kinda bad but she ride it like a fucking pony"" 
 I cut down on her man, be her fuckin' story 
 Yeah I'm talking 'bout you man, get to know me 
 Ain't no offense though, I promise you 
 If you a real man, dude, you gon' decide the truth 
 But I'm a nice dude with some nice dreams 
 And we could turn this to a nightmare, Elm Street 
 La la la la la la la la 
 I'm so gone, so gone 
 Bring out the glass tables 
 Whip the 707 out 
 La la la la la la la la 
 I'm so gone, so gone 
 Bring out the glass tables

3,The Weeknd,pop,The Morning,"I'm fucking gone right now 
 I'm fucking gone right now 
 Listen, listen 
 From the morning to the evening, complaints from the tenants 
 Got the walls kicking like they six months pregnant 
 Drinking Aliz√© with our cereal for breakfast 
 Girls calling cabs at dawn quarter to seven 
 Sky's getting cold, we're flying from the north 
 Rockin' with our city like a sold out show 
 House full of pros that specialize in the ho'in 
 Make that money rain as they taking off they clothes 
 Order plane tickets, Cali is the mission 
 Visit every month like I'm split life living 
 Let the world listen if a hater's caught slipping 
 Then my niggas stay tight, got my back like Pippen 
 Fast life gripping, yeah, we still tippin' 
 Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid 
 Fakes try to mimic, get girls timid 
 But behind closed doors they get poles so rigid 
 All that money, the money is the motive 
 All that money, the money is the motive 
 All that money, the money she be folding 
 Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work 
 Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work 
 Girl put in work 
 Push it to the limit, push it through the pain 
 I push it for the pleasure like a virgin to the game 
 A virgin to that money, a virgin to the fame 
 So this my only chance and when I'm over only pray 
 That I flow from the bottom, closer to the top 
 The higher that I climb, the harder I'mma drop 
 These pussy ass niggas tryna hold on to their credit 
 So I tell them use a debit, watch they image start to lessen 
 I warn them like discretion, why these niggas testing? 
 Always fucking twisted, why these niggas testing? 
 Shit that I got them on straight bar hopping 
 To the music of the ambiance, get shit popping 
 Zombies of the night, niggas ain't talking 
 If they hyping to the crew get it in like pockets 
 Downtown loving, when the moon coming 
 Only place to find baseheads and hot women 
 All that money, the money is the motive 
 All that money, the money is the motive 
 All that money, the money she be folding 
 Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work 
 Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work 
 Girl put in work 
 Better slow down, she'll feel it in the morning 
 Ain't the kind of girl you'll be seeing in the morning 
 Too damn raw ain't no nigga with her rollin' 
 Ain't no nigga that she holding, man, her love is too damn foreign 
 Look at all that money, the money is the motive 
 All that money, the money she be folding 
 Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work 
 Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work 
 All that money, the money is the motive 
 All that money, the money is the motive 
 All that money, the money she be folding 
 Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work 
 Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work 
 Girl put in work"

 Shouldn't have fucking rolled 
 But I fucking rolled 
 Feeling like a million bucks before 
 I walk through the store 
 When I walk through your door 
 Can't believe I made it but I made it that's for sure 
 For sure, loving I need more, I need yours 
 She ain't looking for that unconditional 
 What the fuck these bitches on 
 They want what I'm sittin' on 
 They don't want my love 
 They just want my potential 
 Fuck it though, sippin' on this 
 Baby livin' off bliss got me drowning in your love 
 Got me drowning in the mist 
 Gimme my attention or I'll start drowning from my wrist 
 Baby if you knew the feeling I would give to you 
 Oh you

 'Cause I got it girl, oh I got it girl 
 With me, with me 
 Oh you, oh you 
 Oh you, oh you 
 Oh I got it girl, oh I got it girl 
 With me, with me 
 I got a brand new girl call it Rudolph 
 She'll probably OD before I show her to mama 
 All these girls tryna tell me she got no love 
 And all these girls never ever got her blow job 
 Ringtone on silent 
 And if she stops then I might get violent 
 No calls worth stopping 
 So mama please stop calling 
 We could play all night 
 It just takes one night 
 To let me fucking prove this feeling I'ma give to you 
 Oh you, you 
 Oh you, Oh I got it girl, oh I got it girl

 I don't care about nobody else 
 'Cause I've been on these streets way too long 
 Baby I've been on this too long 
 It's getting faded too long 
 Got me on this rolling stone 
 So I take another hit 
 Kill another seroton' 
 With a hand full of beans 
 And a chest full of weed 
 Got me singing 'bout a bitch 
 While I'm blowing out my steam

 Why you think I fuckin' flow? 
 And I'ma keep on smoking till I can't hit another note 
 Ooh, but until then 
 I got you 
 Baby I got you 
 Until you're used to my face 
 And my mystery fades 
 I got you 
 So baby love me 
 Before they all love me 
 Until you won't love me 
 Because they all left me 
 I'll be different 
 I think I'll be different 
 I hope I'm not different

 That you seduce every man, this time you won't seduce me 
 She's saying, ""That's okay, hey baby do what you please 
 I have the stuff the you want, I am the thing that you need""

 She waits at backstage doors for those who have prestige 
 Who promise fortune and fame, a life that's so carefree 
 She's saying, ""That's okay, hey baby, do what you want 
 I'll be your night lovin' thing, I'll be the freak you can taunt 
 And I don't care what you say, I want to go too far

 But I hate sleepin' alone why don't you come with me?"" 
 I said, ""My baby's at home, she's probably worried tonight"" 
 I didn't call on the phone to say that I'm alright 
 Diana walked up to me, she said, ""I'm all yours tonight"" 
 At that I ran to the phone, sayin', ""Baby I'm alright"" 
 I said, ""Unlock the door because I forgot the key"" 
 She said, ""He's not coming back because he's sleeping with me""

 Now your girls all wanna fuck 
 Girl you could've been the one 
 Now gotta change my number twice a month 
 When you could have simply kept it on the down low 
 Baby if I knew you'd be living in my sheets 
 I wouldn't have shown you any love 
 I would have left you in the club 
 You said you don't belong 
 You keep saying there's no one 
 And there's no where to go 
 But who keeps calling on your phone? 
 I'm so wrong, I'm so wrong, I'm so wrong 
 Girl if your man calls your phone again 
 Girl if your man calls your phone again"
28,The Weeknd,pop,Valerie,"There comes a time in a man's life 
 Where he must take responsibility 
 For the choices he has made 
 There are certain things that he must do 
 Things that he must say 
 Like I Love you 
 And I need you 
 I only want you 
 And nobody's goin' to know if it's true 
 I never thought I'd feel this kind of hesitation (tonight) 
 My hand on another girl 
 I wish I didn't have to lie 
 I wish I could let you know 
 'Cause I love you 
 And I need you 
 I only want you 
 And nobody's going to know if it's true 
 Valerie 
 (Oh Valerie) 
 I know you can see through me 
 (I know you can see through my lies) 
 Valerie 
 (Oh Valerie) 
 You just choose to never know 
 (No you just don't know what I do, what I do, oh Valerie) 
 Valerie 
 Why pretend to trust in me? 
 (I don't know why you try to trust in me baby, but I think I might know) 
 Valerie 
 (I know, Valerie) 
 You'd rather this than be alone 
 (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) 
 'Cause I love you 
 And I need you 
 I only want you 
 And nobody's going to know if its true 
 And I love you 
 ('Cause I love you baby) 
 And I need you 
 (When I need, need...) 
 I only want you 
 And nobody gonna know..."
29,The Weeknd,pop,Till Dawn (Here Comes The Sun),"I tell myself that I'll take you for the last time 
 I'll be over you eventually 
 Time after time, you seem to brush me off 
 I understand what we have become 
 You wash your neck when you leave, now I know your routine 
 I was in love with your mystery 
 Now I just take what I can get from you 
 I'm not embarrassed to be what you want me to be 
 Cause unlike you I got nothing to hide 
 I don't pretend to have any shame 
 I got a box we could put all your lies in 
 Until the end of days 
 You know that I will be a call away 
 The call you make when you're all alone 
 And I know that I will always be the one 
 You repent when you are done 
 Well here comes the sun 
 And you're in my arms 
 And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance 
 That you'll stay through the night 
 You just wanna fill the void now 
 I can tell that you've been yelling at him all night long 
 And I can hear it in your voice now 
 He got you smoking extra packs a day 
 Don't you worry 'bout me talking 
 I know why you've been coming 
 I'll be quiet this ain't nothing to me 
 Just wrap your legs around my waist 
 I won't stop until you ask me 
 Don't you worry 'bout us messing up my sheets 
 Cause unlike you I got nothing to hide 
 You're gonna hate him 
 Then you'll want me 
 Then you'll miss him 
 Then you'll hate me 
 Girl, I know you so well 
 Girl, I know your routine"
30,The Weeknd,pop,Professional,"It's ideal 
 You need someone to tell you how to feel 
 And you think your happiness is real 
 There's so much more the world has to reveal 
 But you choose to be concealed 
 So you're somebody now 
 But what's a somebody in a nobody town 
 I don't think you even know it 
 So you're somebody now 
 But what's a somebody in a nobody town 
 You made enough to quit a couple years ago 
 But it consumes you 
 It's everywhere you go 
 And just the thought alone got you trippin' 
 Got you losing your mind 
 And I don't blame you 
 It's everything you know 
 All this time this ain't you 
 Da da da da 
 I decide when we're through 
 I love, you love 
 This love 
 We're professional 
 I love, you love 
 We're sophisticated 
 At lovin'... 
 What does it mean 
 When your heart's already numb 
 You're professional 
 Won't treat it like it's personal 
 No, this is just love 
 It always makes its way back around 
 It's dispensable 
 To fall is unacceptable 
 Cause everything you've been through made you stronger 
 And every day you learn about yourself 
 And nothing really played out how it's supposed to 
 Depending on somebody else's wealth 
 But now you know the value of a dollar 
 And girl I make enough of it to spend 
 I love the way you've put yourself together 
 I love the way you make that body bend 
 For me again, oh yeah 
 I love, you love 
 This love 
 We're professional 
 I love, you love 
 We're sophisticated 
 At lovin'... 
 All of those nights you were up barely holding your own 
 Girl, you've got it made 
 Had you blaming yourself for when life did you wrong 
 Now, you've got it made 
 Getting rich to the drums of your favorite song 
 Girl, you've got it made 
 Cause your freedom was here in this cage all along 
 Ooh, how'd you drain all the soul from your eyes 
 How'd you teach, teach yourself how to smile 
 In a world where your dreams can't be real, no 
 Every touch that you sell is a lie 
 I love, you love 
 This love 
 We're professional 
 I love, you love 
 We're sophisticated 
 At lovin'..."
31,The Weeknd,pop,The Town,"You did many things that I liked, that I liked 
 And you like diamond rings 
 I can provide, I can provide for you 
 You made me feel so good 
 Before I left on the road 
 And you deserve your name on a crown, on a throne 
 You did many things that I liked, that I liked 
 And you like diamond rings 
 I can provide, I can provide for you 
 You made me feel so good 
 Before I left on the road 
 And you deserve your name on a crown, on a throne 
 I haven't been around the town in a long while 
 I apologize but I 
 I've been trying to get this money like I got a couple kids who rely on me 
 I remember on the bathroom floor 
 Before I went on tour 
 When you said we couldn't do it again 
 Cause you had a thing with some other man 
 You said it was love 
 And you said you were lost 
 Then you wished me good luck 
 To find somebody to love 
 But, ooh 
 Now I've heard that you're single 
 And oh, I'll give you something to live for 
 Yes, I would 
 Honey please 
 You never thought you'd ever see my face again 
 But your love just swayed the lies 
 When he stared into your eyes 
 He just might be too good for you 
 You're almost dead to him 
 You're sleeping with a frozen heart 
 Well baby girl it's over now 
 And you can always count on me 
 Your unshackled bind, unrestrainted touch 
 So immune to love 
 And it feels so priceless to me 
 That you're always free 
 That you'll take me in 
 Now, I'm everything, your everything 
 I bet you'll take me in 
 I know you'll take me in now 
 The same place I left you in 
 I bet you'll take me in 
 I know you'll take me in, I know you'll take me in 
 The same place I left you in 
 You did many things that I liked, that I liked 
 And you like diamond rings 
 I can provide, I can provide for you 
 You made me feel so good 
 Before I left on the road 
 And you deserve your name on a crown, on a throne"
32,The Weeknd,pop,Adaptation,"When the sun goes up, you're searching for a love 
 So your heart won't lead you to anyone 
 When the sun goes down, I know what you become 
 You become awaken, like the rest of us 
 I lay my head on a thousand beds 
 It's been a test to see how far a man can go without himself 
 I think I lost the only piece that held it all in place 
 Now my madness is the only love I let myself embrace 
 I could've stayed 
 But I chose the life 
 I chose the life 
 Then I realized 
 She might have been the one 
 I let it go 
 For a little fun 
 I made a trade 
 Gave away our days 
 For a little fame 
 Now I'll never see your face 
 But it's okay I adapted anyway 
 Adapted to these models 
 Who's adapted to the bottle 
 They take it down like water 
 Just to burn away their sorrows 
 I'll stay up till tomorrow 
 Just to tear down all their morals 
 And all is fair in love and war 
 She's pure, so pure, like the love that's so uncut and raw 
 And clean, so clean, as opposed to what I offered 
 Because I chose the life 
 I chose the life 
 Then I realized 
 She might have been the one 
 I let it go 
 For a little fun, oh 
 I made a trade 
 Gave away our days 
 For a little fame 
 Now I'll never see your face 
 But it's okay I adapted anyway 
 She might just be the one 
 She might just be the one 
 She might just be the one 
 She might just be the one"
33,The Weeknd,pop,Love In The Sky,"There's no one inside 
 But you're free to relax 
 If you commit to this ride 
 There's no turning back 
 You've been here before 
 Remember these sheets 
 This world's not for us 
 It's not what it seems 
 We'll learn to love how to dream, dream 
 You'll learn to love how to dream, dream 
 There's no need to hide 
 Don't overreact 
 You said you've been to the sky 
 We'll go beyond that 
 You've been here before, girl 
 Remember these sheets 
 This world's not for us 
 It's not what it seems 
 We'll learn to love how to dream, dream 
 You'll learn to love how to dream, dream 
 I'll teach you to dream, ooh 
 We'll find our love in the sky 
 We'll find our love in the sky 
 We'll find our love in the sky 
 We'll find our love in the sky 
 We'll find our love in the sky 
 We'll find our love in the sky 
 How does it feel? 
 Do you feel like you did before? 
 Do you see the world getting small? 
 How does it feel, are you free? 
 As for me, I've been getting grown 
 As for me, I've been getting old 
 As for me, I've been flying around the world 
 I've been killing these shows 
 But I'm always getting high 
 Cause my confidence is low 
 And I'm always in a rush 
 Ain't no time to fuck slow 
 And even if I try 
 It's not something I would know 
 But I'm sure I'll make you cum 
 Two or three times in a row 
 But I'm sure you would have left 
 Got that pussy in control 
 Put that pussy in control 
 I got it in control 
 Control, control, control, mmmmh"
34,The Weeknd,pop,Belong To The World,"I know you want your money, girl 
 Cause you do this every day, okay 
 The way you doubt your feelings 
 And look the other way 
 Well, it's something I relate to 
 Your gift of nonchalance 
 Nobody's ever made me fall in love 
 With this amount of touch 
 I'm not a fool 
 I just love that you're dead inside (that you're dead inside) 
 I'm not a fool, I'm just lifeless too 
 But you to taught me how to feel 
 When nobody ever would 
 And you taught me how to love 
 What nobody ever could 
 Ooh girl, I know I should leave you 
 And learn to mistreat you 
 Cause you belong to the world 
 And ooh girl, I want to embrace you 
 Domesticate you 
 But you belong to the world 
 And I know that I'm saying too much 
 Even though I'd rather hold my tongue 
 And I'll pull you closer holding on to 
 Every moment till my time is done 
 And this ain't right, you've been the only one to make me smile 
 In such long, I've succumbed to what I've become, baby 
 I'm not a fool 
 I just love that you're dead inside (that you're dead inside) 
 I'm not a fool, I'm just lifeless too 
 Ooh girl, I should leave you (I know I should leave you) 
 And learn to mistreat you (And learn to mistreat you) 
 Because you belong to the world 
 And ooh girl, I wanna embrace you 
 Domesticate you 
 But, you belong to the world 
 But, you belong to the world 
 But, you belong to the world 
 You belong to the loneliness of filling every need 
 You belong to the world, you belong to the world 
 You belong to the temporary moments of a dream 
 Ooh girl, I know I should leave you 
 And learn to mistreat you 
 Cause you belong to the world 
 And ooh girl, I want to embrace you 
 Domesticate you 
 But you belong to the world"
35,The Weeknd,pop,Live For,"Getting sober for a day 
 Got me feeling too low 
 Always try and make me slow down 
 Tryna tell me how to live 
 I'm about to lose control 
 If they can watch me fuck it up all in one night 
 I'm in my city in the summer 
 Camo'd up, leather booted 
 Kissing bitches in the club 
 They wanna threesome, then some 
 Spend whatever come in, fucking income 
 Me and my niggas we ain't never going broke 
 And you, have to, do it all 
 Just to know where it gets you 
 Living dreams we can never afford

 How long do you think, 
 It's gon' take for y'all to fall 
 That's a serious question 
 'Cause I'm seriously questioning all of y'all 
 Been touring the world man 
 I've done spent racks in all the malls 
 And they know my story, flaws and all 
 I still got plaques hanging wall to wall dawg 
 She just offered a strip tease 
 But she don't look like Demi Moore 
 Hips all on 45, waist all on 24 
 And it's all love in the city 
 Still scream XO, when that Henny pour 
 But I'm that boy, not just any boy 
 What the fuck you think that I'm in it for 
 Roll up in that thing, got hoes like Prince 
 But they know I'm king 
 Chubbs might hold that thing, 
 If he get caught, he'll be home by spring 
 Things I shouldn't share, 
 I mean for the sake of my career 
 I'm not trynna stunt, 
 I'm just tellin' you the truth, I swear 
 This the shit that I live for 
 With the people I'd die for 
 This the shit you can't fake dawg 
 This the shit you need God for 
 This that shit we really gotta talk about in person 
 There's some shit I need to work on, but I know you see me working

 I can't remember how it looks inside, so you can picture how my life's been 
 I went from starin' at the same four walls for 21 years 
 To seein' the whole world in just twelve months 
 Been gone for so long I might have just found God 
 Well probably not, if I keep my habits up 
 Probably not if I can't keep up with lovin' 
 I can't stand talkin' to brand new girls 
 Only bitches down to fuck when you shower them with ones 
 Probably not if my niggas round them up 
 Probably not if we take 'em to my spot 
 Probably not if I tweak all day just to sleep at night 
 God damn I'm high 
 My doctor told me to stop 
 And he gave me something to pop 
 I mix it up with some Adderall's and I wait to get to the top 
 And I mix it up with some alcohol and I pour it up in a shot 
 I don't care about you, why you worried 'bout me? 
 All I want is that smoke, give me all of that smoke 
 Last week was my rough week, I'm still drippin' down from my nose 
 And I don't know how to drive, I make my driver get high 
 But If he goes under that 110, believe my driver gettin' fired 
 And I don't got any friends, I got XO in my bloodwork 
 And I'm posted up down in Florida, 
 Ft. Lauderdale to that MIA 
 Cold drinks, Grand Marnier 
 To the break of dawn, Kahlua milk 
 White Russian when the sun hits, 
 White Russian with tongue tricks 
 I like the feeling of your tongue rings 
 She likes the way my whole tongue flip 
 She grind hard for tuition 
 She grind hard to her teacher 
 I make it harder, with gold grills 
 I make her suck, with gold grills 
 In the back room, In the VIP 
 She don't ever leave...

 Does it make you strong? 
 Do you feel like you can take the planet on, oh girl 
 Did I seem to give you a little bit more love 
 To your lonely life, to your empty life 
 Little life, little life, oh yeah 
 Do you feel like you got your money's worth

 And I know my lies could not make you believe 
 Running in circles, that's why 
 In my dark times I'll be going back to these streets 
 Promising everything I do not mean 
 In my dark times, baby this is all I could be 
 Only my mother could love me for me 
 In my dark times, in my dark times 
 In my dark times I've still got some problems I know 
 Driving too fast but just moving too slow 
 And I've got something I've been trying to let go 
 Pulling me back every time 
 In my dark times taking it back to the street 
 Making those promises that I could not keep 
 In my dark times, baby this is all I could be 
 Only my mother could love me for me) 
 In my dark times taking it down to the street 
 Making those promises that I would not keep 
 In my dark times this is all I could be 
 Only my mother could've loved me for me 
 In my dark times, in my dark times 
 In my dark times"

 It was like it was more than thin air 
 When it's time, when it's time, when it's time 
 It won't matter, it won't matter 
 When it's time, when it's time, when it's time 
 It won't matter, it won't matter 
 When it's time, when it's time, when it's time 
 It won't matter, it won't matter 
 Ooh, now I know what love is 
 And I know it ain't you for sure 
 You'd rather something toxic 
 So, I poison myself again, again 
 'Til I feel nothing 
 In my soul (in my soul) 
 I'm on the edge of something breaking 
 I feel my mind is slowly fadin' 
 If I keep going, I won't make it 
 If I keep going, I won't make it 
 And it's all because of you 
 It's all because of you 
 It's all because of you 
 It's all because of you 
 Woah, woah 
 Don't you, baby, hey 
 It won't matter, baby 
 Don't you know? 
 Don't you know? 
 Ooh, no"
77,The Weeknd,pop,Hurt You,"And now I know relationship's my enemy 
 So stay away from me 
 I'm warning you 
 You try to fill the void with every man you meet 
 'Cause you're upset with me 
 I'm warning you 
 'Cause all the nights you slept alone dryin' your eyes 
 And all the nights you thought about takin' your life 
 'Cause if it's love you want again, don't waste your time 
 But if you call me up, I'm fuckin' you on sight 
 I don't wanna hurt you 
 I don't wanna hurt you 
 I don't wanna hurt you 
 I don't wanna hurt you 
 When you're with him, you close your eyes and think of me 
 Just call me up again 
 I'll make you weak 
 Girl, I'll come to put myself between your lips 
 Not between your heart 
 Can't you see? 
 That all the nights we slept alone, dryin' your eyes ('cause of me, baby) 
 And all the nights you thought about takin' your life ('cause of me, baby) 
 'Cause if it's love you want again, don't waste your time (don't you waste) 
 If you call me up, I'm fuckin' you on sight 
 I don't wanna hurt you 
 I don't wanna hurt you 
 I don't wanna hurt you 
 I don't wanna hurt you 
 I don't wanna hurt you 
 I don't wanna hurt you 
 I don't wanna hurt you 
 I don't wanna hurt you 
 I don't want 
 I don't want 
 I don't want 
 I don't want 
 I don't wanna, baby 
 I don't wanna, baby 
 I don't"
78,The Weeknd,pop,Privilege,"Enjoy your privileged life 
 'Cause I'm not gonna hold you through the night 
 We said our last goodbyes 
 So, let's just try to end it with a smile 
 And I don't wanna hear that you are suffering 
 You are suffering no more 
 'Cause I held you down when you were suffering 
 You were suffering 
 Blues away, way, way 
 I got two red pills to take the blues away 
 Blues away, way, way 
 I got two red pills to take the blues away 
 And I'ma fuck the pain away, and I know I'll be okay 
 They said our love is just a game, I don't care what they say 
 But I'ma drink the pain away, I'll be back to my old ways 
 And I got two red pills to take the blues away, oh 
 I don't wanna hear that no more, no more 
 No more, no more 
 I don't wanna hear that no more"
