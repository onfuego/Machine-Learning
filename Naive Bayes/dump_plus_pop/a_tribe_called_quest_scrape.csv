0,A Tribe Called Quest,hiphop,Push It Along,"(Q-Tip) 
 Q-Tip is my title. 
 I don't think that is vital for me to be your idol, 
 But dig this recital. 
 If you can't envision a brother who ain't dissin 
 Slingin' this and that, 'cause this and that was missin' 
 Instead, it's been injected, the Tribe has been perfected 
 Oh yes, it's been selected, the art makes it protected 
 Afrocentric livin', Africans be givin' 
 A lot to the cause 'cause the cause has been risen 
 Some brothers, they be flammin', thinkin' we ain't slammin' 
 Comin' off like the days where we used to wear the tans and 
 A blue-colllar talker, a hemisphere stalker 
 A glass of O.J and a ten mile walk-a 
 If you're in a Jeep and you dig what you're hearin 
 Can I get a beep and a side order of cheerin? 
 I am what I am, that's a tribal man 
 We all know the colours, we all must stand 
 As we start our travels, things they will unravel 
 ""Que sera sera"", for this unit is like gravel 
 Won't be gone for long, listen to the song 
 If you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is 
 Push it along, push it along. 
 Push it along, yeah, push it along. (repeat 4x) 
 (Phife Dawg) 
 Put one up for the Phifer, it's time to decipher 
 The ills of the world make the situation lighter 
 The clock is always tickin', the systems should be kickin 
 Like ? ham and eggs, I eat chicken, chicken, chicken 
 Should I release the lever, the lever of the clever 
 Embelish on the funk as we start to endeavour? 
 The ?wraughts? of the rap filling up the gap 
 With the smash of a hand and a little toe tap 
 (Q-Tip) 
 The boom, the bip, the boom bip 
 Indicates to the brothers that we be on the flip tip 
 Phonies start to crumble, funky rhythm rumbles 
 Through the dance-hall, but my anthem is humble 
 It's the nitty-gritty, my time is itty-bitty 
 So I ?kick the slash for the gipper? and the witty 
 This ain't trial and error, more like tribe and error 
 Constantly rude as some sort of tribal terror 
 The street can't depart from the bloody heart 
 Repair the wear and tear, don't start 'fore it starts 
 Won't be gone for long, listen to the song 
 If you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is 
 (Q-Tip) 
 Marchin' off the project, we hope that you will subject 
 It's good to be an object and never, ever reject 
 The tribe who meanders with drunken propaganda 
 Keep it in boom and never will we slander 
 ? Should be handed, don't let me demand it 
 Money gives a nudge to the poet star bandit 
 Control it, then recluse it, follow, you won't lose it 
 Mysterious is the tribe for we choose it 
 Although she's flippin' crazy, give my love to Gracy 
 God, could you help 'cause this Quest is crazy spacey? 
 The pigs are wearin' blue, and in a year or two 
 We'll be goin' up the creek in a great big canoe 
 What we gonna do, save me and my brothers? 
 Hop inside the bed and pull over the covers 
 Never will we do that and we ain't tryin' to rule that 
 We just want a slab of the ham, don't you know, black? 
 This society of fake reality 
 Are nothin' but a peg of informality 
 While I sing my song, sing it all day long, 
 If you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is"
1,A Tribe Called Quest,hiphop,Luck Of Lucien,"(Q-Tip) 
 Brother, brother, brother, Lucien, you're like no other 
 Listen very close, 'cause I don't like to boast 
 Instead, I'll tell the tale of a French who prevailed 
 Through the Mr. Crazy Rabbits who were always on his tail 
 When in on sale, your roomie starts to wail 
 Get caught with stolen goods and you will go to jail 
 If you go to jail, then who will pay the bail? 
 They'll put you back to France on a ship with a sail 
 Escargot, Lucien, you eat snails 
 (Hey yo Tip, what's wrong with snails?) 
 From the Zulu nation, from a town called Paris 
 Came to America to find liberty 
 Instead of finding pleasure, all you found was misery 
 But listen, Lucien, you have a friend in me 
 Oh, luck luck will drive your butt batty 
 Next time you get some wheels, make it a Caddy 
 In terms of doing good, I know you wish you really could 
 But listen, brother man, I really think you can 
 Succeed with the breed of the brothers on your back 
 It's the creme de la creme, and you can bounce with that 
 It'll take a minute rice, so take my advice 
 Trust in us, and thus you trust in your life 
 Lucine, Lucien, Lucien, Lucien - you should know! 
 (Q-Tip) 
 Are you ready, Lu? This one is for you 
 Comin' from a true-blue, fits like a shoe 
 ""Cómo está usted"" or ""Comment allez-vous"" 
 Lucien, I'll leave it up to you. 
 Voulez-vous? (vous) 
 Rendez-vous (vous) 
 Coucou (cou) ... 
 Les poo-poo (poo) 
 Watch that lass, gonna backlash fast 
 Can you get a grip on the crackhead dip? 
 Sold you a paper bag, guess he saw you comin' 
 VCR from a neck-bone bummin 
 $10 brother, he was hummin' and strummin 
 Only had 20, he was livin' like ya slummin' 
 Gave him the money, well, I thought that was somethin' 
 Lookin' like a kid who was lost in crumbin 
 Don't worry about a thing, I won't get specific 
 This is a song that is long and prolific 
 Think of the stuff that I said if you can 
 Figure it out, compute, understand 
 No problemo, I'll help you with your demo 
 If you go to the store for me 
 Lucien, I'm just kiddin - you should know! 
 (Q-Tip) 
 You gotta get a grip on the missions you'll be takin' 
 Not so much the mission, but you got crazy ignition 
 Sure, the sugar-babies wanna give you a chance 
 With the French ""savoir faire"" and the sexy dance 
 But is she really fly, or is she a guy? 
 I won't ask why, 'cause I know that you try 
 You try too hard, is that the answer to the riddle? 
 Instead of doin' so much, why don't you do just a little? 
 Boy, what a cad, I guess we shouldn't treat him bad 
 In fact, it would be nice if we understood him like 
 A case of positionin' the feet in the shoes 
 Sympathetic reason in the case of the blues 
 Lucien is blue, even though he's really brown 
 I had to make the sound, his life is too profound 
 On the up-and-up, he's somethin' like a little pup 
 Young and naive, it's hard to believe 
 As long as you're strong, you can quest with the questers 
 Jolly like a jumping bean or a jester 
 Lucien, Lucien, Lucien, Lucien - you should know!"
2,A Tribe Called Quest,hiphop,After Hours,"Chorus (After Hours it was cool x8) 
 Q-Tip: 
 Ten after one I think I'll hop the horse 
 Downtown late of three of course 
 Just came from fishing couldn't get a catch 
 Downtown they'll probably have a batch 
 A whiting sandwich and a Guinness Stout 
 But with the beer though I had a bout 
 So I exchanged it for some apple juice 
 I had the blues but I shook them loose 
 A jeep is blasting from the urban streets 
 Loots of funk over hardcore beats 
 The moon dabbles in the morning sky 
 As the minutes just creep on by 
 I get a thought and hear comes my Tribe 
 Ritual shakes and in good vibes 
 Like always the Quest begins 
 In the mist though but the rhyth's move in 
 We find a spot and we sit and chat 
 Speaking on the status quo of rap 
 A derelick makes a real long speech 
 We pay attention to the words he read 
 When he was done we rattled on 
 There was no lunch because it wasn't dawn 
 We pointed things out about this times 
 The worlds famons and the crazy crimes 
 Inflation of the nation, it bothers me 
 I better go gold, to pay the taxes 
 Gotta be swift society 
 The man whose made is the man who maxes 
 The grounds for living are being discussed 
 As we go it gets close to dusk 
 Gather thoughts and savor breath 
 Cause there's only a few hours left 
 After Hours it was cool (x8) 
 Q-Tip: 
 Me oh my, hey-hey, hey-hey 
 The human hours are here to stay 
 This is how it seems (?) my witness 
 Bug out all night, ask Phife, he's with this 
 Girls be screaming on this conversation 
 I have my two cents for a revelation 
 And my watch continuously tic-tocs 
 Shaheed will bring up the beats that rocks 
 I hear the frogs and the smashing of bottles 
 A car revs up and I hear it trottle 
 It probably moves with the morning wind 
 Oh my God, here's Phife again 
 (?) Talking about last nights game 
 Trying to remember someone's name 
 So hear the frogs dancing in the streets 
 Once again Ali will bring up the beat 
 Like this 
 (Sounds of frogs) 
 Q-Tip: 
 The beat is over and so is the night 
 The sun is risen and the shine is bright 
 We all say peace and go our separate ways 
 Youth is fading as we gain our days 
 Explanation for the song is simp' 
 The hours creep, excuse me, I mean limp 
 As we go you hear a gasp of laugh 
 As we start up our rhythmic path 
 Like this"
3,A Tribe Called Quest,hiphop,Footprints,"(Q-Tip) 
 As we start trudgin, me and my brothers we be lookin' and be buggin 
 Vehicles of life they be rollin' and be mergin 
 Searchin for the virgins of life 
 That be shovin out the door that's crack 
 The valleys of time, are always on my feet 
 As least the beat will combine 
 The calluses and corns with the funky bassline 
 You don't need underdog for a nickel shoeshine or the shoes that's phat 
 Well can I get a level on the bass and on the treble 
 Footin up and down like a UNLV Rebel 
 The answer be amongst us 'cause we rarely dig acoustics 
 Can't be too much flackin, not too much packin 
 You must container that at least to dip your hand in rap 
 Your feet will be infectious so at least realise the fact 
 The rhythms are inserted and the nurse can be converted 
 This ain't rock 'n' roll 'cause the rap is in control 
 If you're a megastar, worth will buy you a car 
 I'd rather go barefootin, for prints I will be puttin' 
 All over the earth if we can get there first 
 Now that we are in it, footprints are bein printed 
 So fi you recognise em, you can try to size em 
 They'll probably be the ones with the size not fryin 
 All over reveal, you won't have to yield 
 If you want protection you can hide behind the shield 
 (Q-Tip) 
 You can game on the gallons if you really need to rock 
 But we walk while we talk as we stompin through the block 
 Hand in hand 'cross the land as Muhammad cross the fade 
 It's a Tribe who meanders, precious like a jade 
 It's a art, Theo arch rhymes the ground placed upon 
 The mind will unwind, it will soft to beyond 
 Catch the track, track by track, get a map to track a trail 
 You will find yourself behind for a map does not prevail 
 See the levels peakin as the rhythms keep-a screechin 
 A Quest, oh yes a Quest, inside the jam I will keep preachin 
 The point, oh yes the point, because it's close but yet so far 
 The loudiness is ringin' as we scoot across the star 
 We are bulgin, I'm indulgin in a rat-a-tat-tat 
 Explanation for the liners that the rhythm is phat 
 Keep it wild, wide and deep, you could dig it in a jeep 
 But dig it in the ground because the foot print now 
 (Q-Tip) 
 If there's a storm that's brewin, it won't keep us from doin' 
 Our thing as we start swingin', travellin is bringin' 
 Joy inside the domes as we hit the road to roam/Rome 
 A chair is not a chair, a house is not a home 
 Because my skin is brown, yo I'm gonna do the town 
 Rub it in the face and rub my feet all through the place 
 When you get your finger on the music it'll linger 
 Sing a song o' sixpence, sing it like a singer 
 A Nubian, a Nubian, a proud one at that 
 Remember me, the brother who said ""Black is black"" 
 You can come by request, I don't play, I don't dress 
 Get emotions off your chest, we are black, we the best 
 Makin' moves, makin' motions, flowin like an ocean 
 The walkin' will continue, we know that we will bring you 
 The times that you have waited, more anticipated 
 Be gone but not for long because the feet will stay strong"
4,A Tribe Called Quest,hiphop,I Left My Wallet In El Segundo,"Left my wallet in El Segundo 
 Left my wallet in El Segundo 
 Left my wallet in El Segundo 
 I gotta get it, I got-got ta get it 
 I left my wallet in El Segundo 
 Left my wallet in El Segundo 
 Left my wallet in El Segundo 
 I gotta get it, I got-got ta get it 
 My mother went away for a month-long trip 
 Her and some friends on an ocean-liner ship 
 She made a big mistake by leaving me home 
 I had to roam so I picked up the phone 
 Dialed Ali up to see what was going down 
 Told him I pick him up so we could drive around 
 Took the Dodge Dart, a '74 
 My mother left a yard but I needed one more 
 Shaheed had me covered with a hundred greenbacks 
 So we left Brooklyn and we made big tracks 
 Drove down the Belt, got on the Conduit 
 Came to a toll, we paid and went through it 
 Had no destination, we was on a quest 
 Ali laid in the back so he can get rest 
 Drove down the road for two days and a half 
 The sun had just risen on a dusty path 
 Just then a figure had caught my eye 
 A man with a sombrero who was four feet high 
 I pulled over to ask, were we was at 
 His index finger he tipped up his hat 
 ""El Segundo,"" he said, ""my name is Pedro 
 If you need directions, I'll tell you pronto"" 
 Needed civilization, some sort of reservation 
 He said a mile south, there's a fast food station 
 Thanks, senor, as I start up the motor 
 Ali said, ""Damn, Tip, what you drive so far for?"" 
 (Well describe to me what the wallet looks like) 
 Anyway a gas station we passed 
 We got gas and went on to get grub 
 It was a nice little pub in the middle of nowhere 
 Anywhere would have been better 
 I ordered enchiladas and I ate 'em 
 Ali had the fruit punch 
 When we finished we thought for ways to get back 
 I had a hunch 
 Ali said, ""Pay for lunch"", so I did it 
 Pulled out the wallet and I saw this wicked 
 Beautiful lady she was a waitress there 
 Put the wallet down and stared and stared 
 To put me back into reality, here's Shaheed: 
 ""Yo, Tip, man, you got what you need?"" 
 I checked for keys and started to step 
 But, what do you know, my wallet I forget 
 Yo, it was a brown wallet, it had props numbers 
 Had my jimmy hats I got to get it man 
 Lord, have mercy 
 The heat got hotter, Ali starts to curse me 
 I feel bad but he makes me feel badder 
 Chit-chit-chatter, car stars to scatter 
 Breaking on out, we was Northeast bound 
 Jettin' on down at the speed of sound 
 Three days coming and three more going 
 We get back and there was no slack 
 490 Madison, we're here, Sha 
 He said, ""All right, Tip, see you tomorrow"" 
 Thinking about the past week, the last week 
 Hands go in my pocket, I can't speak 
 Hopped in the car and torpe'ed to the shack 
 Of Shaheed, ""We gotta go back"" 
 When he said ""Why?"" I said, ""We gotta go 
 'Cause I left my wallet in El Segundo"" 
 Yeah, I left my wallet in El Segundo 
 Left my wallet in El Segundo 
 Left my wallet in El Segundo 
 I gotta get it, I got-got ta get it 
 Left my wallet in El Segundo 
 Left my wallet in El Segundo 
 Left my wallet in El Segundo 
 Come on, let's go... 
 Come on, let's go... 
 Come on, let's go..."
5,A Tribe Called Quest,hiphop,Pubic Enemy,"Red Alert: 
 Check this out, Cool DJ Red Alert 
 With my man, Q-Tip and Shaheed 
 Q-Tip: 
 In the morning, woke up from sexual pleasures 
 Looked at her sexual partner 
 Who acquainted her acquaintance 
 Five hours ago at a disco 
 She went lower than low, into limbo 
 A thought crossed the mind, her, a bimbo 
 She answered no, so she had to go... 
 On with the program 
 Creedence, it seems that I've forgotten your name 
 But it seems that she's done the same 
 And now something has happened 
 Suddenly, she's been distracted 
 By something that has been attracted 
 She poked and poked and smacked at it 
 Then she broke down and she scratched it 
 Now, I think you understand 
 Clinic, saw the doctor flex his biceps 
 Then he picked up a pair of forceps 
 Her pretty face showed fright 
 Right then and there, she fainted 
 A really grim picture is painted 
 The brotha who she acquainted 
 Was the enemy, scary ain't it? 
 The Pubic Enemy 
 Red Alert: 
 Pubic Eeeeeenemy! 
 Let me tell you more about pubic enemy 
 Ay, Q-Tip 
 Q-Tip: 
 Old King Cole was a merry old soul 
 Had a lady queen, married since 18 
 He protested, that he was infested 
 Get lots of love and he couldn't digest it 
 All propaganda, one big fat lie 
 'Cause I see the king with my very own eye 
 Schemed and schemed like a crack fiend king 
 And poppin' up on the teammates scene 
 And poppin' and pimpin' on hunnies with moneys 
 Whole situation to me, was kinda funny 
 He hold the crown but not the jimmy hat 
 Now he wears a frown and the jimmy hates that 
 So the fair maiden in the royal bedroom 
 Caught the king scratchin, so she had to assume 
 That he got vicked by the enemy's trick 
 The thought of cheatin' made the maiden so sick 
 That she screamed and screamed, went on and kept screamin 
 Threw a pot and his dome was beamin 
 You could hear him yellin' in the motherland 
 ""Baby, baby please. Baby, understand."" 
 She ignored and walked through the gate 
 The king is in the kingdom to await his fate... 
 Of the enemy The Pubic Enemy 
 Q-Tip and Red Alert:

 Before this, did you really know what live was? 
 Comprehend to the track, for it's why 'cause 
 Gettin' measures on the tip of the vibers 
 Rock and roll to the beat of the funk fuzz 
 Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug 
 If you feel the urge to freak, do the jitterbug 
 Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug 
 Afrocentric living is a big shrug 
 A life filled with fun that's what I love 
 A lower plateau is what we're above 
 If you diss us, we won't even think of 
 Will Nipper the doggy give a big shove? 
 This rhythm really fits like a snug glove 
 Like a box of positives it's a plus, love

 Follow us for the funky behavior

 We cough up your lungs, cough up your cud 
 Put out fires, with a 40, ounce of water 
 You know you oughta 
 Dance to this, your girl you kiss 
 I like fried foods, especially fish 
 Afrocentric, I'm electric 
 Socialistic and eccentric 
 Body's healthy, mind is wealthy 
 Thoughts, they flow, that will propel me 
 To be a Native, get creative 
 Original and designative 
 Listen to the line that's playin' 
 Listen hard to what Q's sayin' 
 Politicians are magicians 
 Make your vote, they hope your wishin 
 Ambiguous words, senseless verbs 
 They all amount to crap that's heard 
 Violent hip hop, money flip flops 
 Promoters won't book, but it still rocks 
 I'm a Zulu, yes, a true blue 
 Red Alert is with the poo-poo 
 Ozone layer, loses flava

 With expressions and I'm guessin 
 19 years is a youthful lesson 
 Fallin' skies babe, open eyes babe 
 Can't you see what lays inside babe 
 Makin' mentions on this tension 
 Rhythmic lovin', my profession 
 Hips, they gyrate, scripts I narrate 
 No banana, I ain't a primate 
 Ain't no soul glo, just an afro 
 The head is bred to let the thoughts grow 
 Quest together, to lands of never 
 Sleet and snow and storms can't sever 
 Tribe is growin', never know when 
 For this time, six necks may show in 
 Dialogues have been accepted 
 Negatives have been rejected 
 That's the music, negro music 
 Is here for all, so you must choose it 
 Phonies fondle, watch it throttle 
 3-6-5 straight out the bottle 
 Bustin' caps, finger snaps 
 I prefer the second for ghetto tracks 
 Phife, Jarobi, Ali told me 
 Get the force like Wan Kenobi 
 Force his teachin, beats are screechin 
 Poly plateaus, we aim for reachin' 
 Tribalization, freaks the nation 
 A mass of peers in celebration 
 Hopes been real high, since the knee high 
 Days of youth, feelin' good and real spry 
 Avid combos, hear those bongos 
 Boom cacka boom, that's how they go 
 We ain't nomads, but we real glad 
 Hip hop slams through the nineties, no fad 
 As a rhythm, have been given 
 Hurry up, become, we breakin out, out

 With a rhythmic instinction to be able to travel 
 Beyond existing forces of life

 From the high-tops to the knotty dreads

 Took the crust away from the third eye lid 
 Now, it's kinda open, longs to see the site 
 Rhythms of the Tribe which is passed out right 
 Night after night, day after day 
 Questin for the rhythms of the Native Tongue lay 
 Rhythm is the key as we open up the door 
 Things a B-boy has never seen before

 If you feel uptight and you need to freak 
 It'll be all right once we drop this beat 
 I got the rhythm, you got the rhythm (8X) 
 Q-Tip: 
 Ma ma sa ah, ma ma coo sa 
 Gets hectic, freak a bourgeios 
 We Quest around for the musical hard 
 On the avenues, streets and boulevard 
 Not sellin out, that's a negative 
 Lovin' hip hop, lovin' heritage 
 Got the instinct to travel miles and miles 
 Gotta whole lot of room for piles and piles 
 Now, you're kinda with it, wanna get the funk 
 From the Zulu Nation, toppin all the junk 
 Standin on the top like the Temptations said 
 Rhythms are obese, yeah, you gotta keep 'em fed 
 Read what I read, can't be better said 
 Tribalic motions dabble in the head 
 Sweetback's bad, not as bad a beat 
 It's a ""stone groove baby"" 
 Continue, on the windy road 
 But, I'm luggin, a crazy big load 
 Will we be on point for the ninety deck 
 Is it muscle bound and will it flex? 
 But trudgin, we are used to 
 You don't Quest alone, Quest with a crew 
 We're four, once more, must make the tracks 
 You see four fronts, but now you see four backs

 I don't eat no ham 'n' eggs, 'cause they're high in cholesterol 
 Jarobi, do you eat em? Nope, Shah, do you eat em? (Nope) 
 Not at all 
 Q-Tip and Phife (trading lines): 
 A tisket, a tasket, what's in mama's basket? 
 Some veggie links and some fish that stinks 
 Why, just the other day, I went to Grandma's house 
 Smelled like she conjured up a mouse 
 Eggs was fryin, ham was smellin 
 In ten minutes, she started yellin' (come and get it) 
 And the gettin's were good 
 I said ""I shouldn't eat it,"" she said ""I think you should"" 
 But I can't, I'm plagued by vegetarians 
 No cats and dogs, I'm not a veterinarian 
 Strictly collard greens and a occasional steak 
 Goes on my plate 
 Asparagus tips look yummy, yummy, yummy 
 Candied yams inside my tummy 
 A collage of good eats, some snacks or nice treats 
 Apple sauce and some nice red beets 
 This is what we snack on when we're Questin' 
 (Both: No second guessin) 
 (Q-Tip: bridge) 
 Phife: 
 Now drop the beat, so I can talk about my favorite tastings 
 The food that is the everlasting, see I'm not fasting 
 I'm gobbling, like a doggon turkey 
 Beef jerky, slim jims, I eat sometimes 
 I like lemons and limes 
 And if not that, take it the road see and the salad sopped 
 Sit back, relax, listen to some hip hop 
 Q-Tip: 
 Gum drops and gummy bears tease my eyes 
 A sight for sore ones and so are pies 
 And other goodies that are filled with goop 
 With fried apple roots 
 Delectable delights, controls my appetites 
 Mine is for me, right, but I know what I like 
 Chicken for lunch, chicken for my dinner 
 Chicken, chicken, chicken, I'm a finger lickin' winner 
 When breakfast time comes, I don't recognize 
 Pig in the pan or a pair of bogey chives 
 Mixed with stewed tomatoes, home fried potatoes 
 Or anything with flair, cook it, I'm in there 
 Pay attention to the Tribe as we impose 
 This is how it goes 
 I don't eat no ham 'n' eggs, 'cause they're high in cholesterol

 All I wanna do is get down y'all 
 Have a ball y'all and freak freak y'all 
 Lifeless ventures ain't new boo 
 So don't boo hoo, yeah, you too 
 Gotta get a grip like culture 
 Swoop down, swoop down like a vulture 
 The rhythms will lurk into people 
 All funk ain't created equal 
 Lookin' for the beat to rupture 
 Like the rapture, gotta capture 
 Don't let the storm of life scare ya 
 Get funky, let me prepare ya 
 For the days of grimness and oppression 
 A yo bro, here's your lesson 
 Even though the rain starts pourin 
 Start reachin', start soarin 
 Don't stop, if you do, you're stallin 
 Rhythm savior, hear ya callin 
 Instrumental to be freaky 
 Go ahead in the rain and you'll see 
 Q-Tip: 
 Can't we make you see 
 I mean, the fact that is the key, I mean 
 Devoted to the art of movin butts, so get on up and... 
 Think about what's yours 
 I mean your culture and your laws 
 I mean, I label you a sucka 
 If you're dumber, just stay dumber, but... 
 Stay in line and keep groovin 
 If it's movin, if it's soothin 
 Don't let a little thing like rain keep you unda 
 Or the fun-da, look at wonda 
 Stomp till your soul is lifted 
 Get with it, rhythm's with it 
 Get inside the groove and get nasty 
 Funky nasty, crazy classy 
 Money is a first on the list here 
 It's the good time, it's the good cheer 
 If you got the ride then ride it 
 Don't hide it, provide it 
 Drop, drop, drop down the pants, shake your fanny 
 'Cause it's handy, not an Annie 
 Rock to the roll with the hair down 
 Get the lowdown, rhythm showdown 
 The simple explanation is nada 
 Make it hotter, thanks, de nada 
 If you wanna hear what I'm sayin' 
 Clean your ears and just come on and groove"

 Her crazy ex-boyfriend is really psychotic (uh-huh) 
 Scares the girl by threatenin her life (word) 
 Says ""Girl, you're dead if you're not my wife"" (oh man) 
 Beats in her public, beats her in private (yes) 
 Tried it 'round me, ""almost"" won't buy it (what you mean?) 
 Said ""Forget him, don't you know he's a loser"" 
 Who would love a woman turn around and abuse her (oh) 
 Only a fool as described by the Tribe

 For this situation makes me sick (oh)

 On the way, a couple resembled

 But the man with the lady grabbed the other by the neck (umm hmm)

14,A Tribe Called Quest,hiphop,Excursions,"(Q-Tip) 
 Back in the days when I was a teenager 
 Before I had status and before I had a pager 
 You could find the Abstract listening to hip hop 
 My pops used to say, it reminded him of be-bop 
 I said, well daddy don't you know that things go in cycles 
 The way that Bobby Brown is just ampin like Michael 
 It's all expected, things are for the lookin' 
 If you got the money, Quest is for the bookin 
 Come on everybody, let's get with the fly modes 
 Still got room on the truck, load the back boom 
 Listen to the rhyme, to get a mental picture 
 Of this black man, through black woman venture 
 Why do I say that, 'cause I gotta speak the truth man 
 Doing what we feel for the music is the proof and 
 Planted on the ground, the act is so together 
 Bonafide strong, you need leverage to sever 
 The unit, yes, the unit, yes, the unit called the jazz is 
 Delivering each year LP filled with street goods 
 You can find it on the rack in your record store (store) 
 If you get the record, then your thoughts are adored 
 And appreciated, 'cause we're ever so glad we made it 
 We work hard, so we gotta thank God 
 Dishin out the plastic, do the dance till you're spastic 
 If you dis... it gets drastic 
 Listen to the rhymes, 'cause its time to make gravy 
 If it moves your booty, then shake, shake it baby 
 All the way to Africa a.k.a. The Motherland (uh) 
 Stick out the left, then I'll ask for the other hand 
 That's the right hand, Black Man (man) 
 Only if you are noted as my man (man) 
 If I get the credit, then I'll think I deserve it 
 If you fake moves, don't fix your mouth to word it 
 Get in the zone of positivity, not negativity 
 'Cause we gotta strive for longevity 
 If you botch up, what's in that (ass) (what?) 
 A pair of Nikes, size ten-and-a-half (come on, come on) 
 We gotta make moves 
 Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on) (4X) 
 ""Time... time is a ship on a merciless sea 
 Drifting toward an average of nothingness 
 Until it can be retarded for it's own destiny 
 TIME is an inanimate object 
 Praying and praying and praying with no justification for belief 
 Time is DANCING, moving lingering all memories of past.."" 
 - The Last Poets 
 We gotta be a winner all the time 
 Can't fall prey to a hip hop crime 
 With the dope raps and dope tracks you move blocks 
 From the fly girlies to the hardest of the rocks 
 Musically the Quest, is on the rise 
 We on these Excursions so you must realize 
 That continually, I pop my Zulu 
 If you don't like it, get off the Zulu tip 
 So what can you do in the times which exist 
 You can't fake moves on your brother or your sis 
 But if your sis is a (bitch), brother is a jerk 
 Leave 'em both alone and continue with your work 
 Whatever it may be in today's society 
 Everything is fair, at least that how it seems to me 
 You must be honest and true to the next 
 Don't be phony and expect one not to flex 
 Especially if you rhyme, you have to live by the pen 
 Your man is your man, then treat him like your friend 
 All it is, is the code of the streets 
 So listen to the knowledge bein dropped over beats 
 Beats that are hard, beats that are funky 
 It could get you hooked like a crackhead junkie 
 What you gotta do to is know that the Tribe is in the sphere 
 The Abstract Poet, prominent like Shakespeare 
 Edgar Allan Poe, it don't stop (uh!) 
 ""Time is running out on black power Africans in the day 
 And white flight supporters at night 
 Everytime you see them they're chasing some white woman with their tongues hangin' out 
 Time is running and passing; passing and running 
 Running and passing; passing and running (excursions)"""

 Yo, microphone check one two what is this 
 The five foot assassin with the roughneck business 
 I float like gravity, never had a cavity 
 Got more rhymes than the Winans got family 
 No need to sweat Arsenio to gain some type of fame 
 No shame in my game 'cause I'll always be the same 
 Styles upon styles upon styles is what I have 
 You wanna diss the Phifer but you still don't know the half 
 I sport New Balance sneakers to avoid a narrow path 
 Messin round with this you catch ?the sizin of em? 
 I never half step 'cause I'm not a half stepper 
 Drink a lot of soda so they call me Dr. Pepper 
 Refuse to compete with BS competition 
 Your name ain't Special Ed so won't you Seckle With the Mission 
 I never walk the streets, think it's all about me 
 Even though deep in my heart, it really could be 
 I just try my best to like go all out 
 Some might even say yo shorty black you're buggin' out 
 (Q-Tip) 
 Zulu Nation, brothers that's creation 
 Minds get flooded, ejaculation 
 Right on the two inch tape 
 The Abstract poet incognito, runs the cape 
 Not the best not the worst and occasionally I curse to get my 
 Point across, so bust, the floss 
 As I go in between, the grit and the dirt 
 Listen to the mission listen Miss as I do work, umm 
 As I crack the, monotone 
 Children of the jazz so, get your own 
 Smokin' R&B 'cause they try to do me 
 Or the best of the pack but they can't do rap 
 For it's Abstract, original 
 You can't get your own and that's pitiful 
 I know I'd be the man if I cold yanked the plug 
 On R&B, but I can't and that's bugged 
 Buggin out, buggin out, buggin out you're buggin out (repeat 8X) 
 (Phife Dawg) 
 Yo when you bug out, you usually have a reason for the action 
 Sometimes you don't, it's just for mere satisfaction 
 People be hounding, always surrounding 
 Pulsing, just like a migraine pounding 
 You don't really fret, you stay in your sense 
 Camouflage your feeling, of absolute tense 
 You soar off to another world, deep in your mind 
 But people seem to take that, as being unkind 
 ""Oh yo he's acting stank,"" really on a regal? 
 A man of the fame, not a man of the people 
 Believe that if you wanna but I tell you this much 
 Riding on the train with no dough, sucks 
 Once again a case of your feet in my Nike's 
 If a crowd is in my realm I'm saying -- mic please 
 Hip-hop is living, can't yank the plug 
 If you do the result will end up kind of bugged 
 (Q-Tip) 
 Yo, I am not an invalid although I used to smoke the weed out 
 Ali Shaheed Muhammad used to say I had to be out 
 Schemin on the cookies with the crazy boomin back buns 
 Pushin on the real ?hardest? so we can have the big fun 
 When I left for Rosie I was Boulevard status 
 Battling a MC was when Tip was at his baddest 
 It was one MC after one MC 
 What the world could they be wanting see from little old me 
 Do I have the formula to save the world? 
 Or was it just because I used to swipe the women and all the girls 
 I'm the type of brother with the crazy extended hand kid 
 Dissed by all my brothers I was all up what my man did 
 Supposed to be my man but now I wonder 'cause you're feeble 
 I go out with the strongest and I separate the evils 
 It's your brain against my mind, for those about to boot out 
 All you nasty critters even though you see I bug out 
 Buggin out, buggin out, buggin out you're buggin out (repeat 8X)"

 Not, the 80's, do away withcha womb

17,A Tribe Called Quest,hiphop,Butter,"Verse One: Phife Dawg 
 1988 Senior Year at Garvey High 
 Where all the guys were corny but the girls were mad fly 
 Loungin with the Tipster, coolin with Sha 
 Scopin out the honeys - they know who they are 
 I was the b-ball playin', fly rhyme sayin' 
 Fly girl gettin' but never was I sweatin 
 'Cause when it came to honeys I would go on a stroll 
 Until I met my match - her name was Flo 
 Yeah - I messed around with the one called Flo 
 All the troopers round the way used to call her a ho 
 But deep down in my heart I knew that Flo was good to go 
 'Cause I thought it was me - like Bell Biv Devoe 
 But little did I know that she was playin' with my mind 
 The only thing I've learned is, good girls are hard to find 
 I feel like Heavy D I need somebody for me 
 Not someone who's mind is blank and tryin' to juice me for my bank 
 Swingin' with my main man Lucky behind my back 
 What type of crap is that - yo, how's about a smack? 
 Word life, I can't front - thought I was all that 
 But now it seems, I met my match 
 Was a stone cold lover, you couldn't tell me jack 
 Settlin' down with one girl, wasn't tryin' to hear that 
 I had Tonya, Tamika, Sharon, Karen 
 Tina, Stacy, Julie, Tracy 
 Used to love 'em, leave 'em, skeeze 'em, tease 'em 
 Find 'em, lose 'em - also abuse 'em 
 My whole attitude was new day, next hon 
 And believe it or not, they all got done 
 Well here comes Flo, with the crazy whip appeal 
 And I'm all true man, like Alexander O'Neal 
 Is this really love, then again, how would I know 
 After all this time tryin' to be a superhoe 
 She finally played me, but yo, I'd find another 
 'Cause I got the crazy game and yo, I'm smooth like butter 
 Chorus: Q-Tip 
 Butter, like butter baby ... (repeat 2X) 
 Not no Parkay, not no margarine, 
 Strickly butter baby, strictly butter 
 Verse Two: Phife Dawg 
 I remember when, 
 Girls were goodie two shoes, but now they turned to freaks 
 All of a sudden ""We love you Phife"" - ease of ho, my name's Malik 
 Phife this, Phife that, where you goin', where you at 
 These girls don't know me from jack, yet I feel like the Mack 
 You didn't want me then, so yo hon, don't want me now 
 Here, Here - take the towel, wipe off your brow 
 And take the contact out your eye, you're far from lookin' fly 
 You get an E for effort, and T for nice try 
 Now tell me what's the reason, for dyin' your hair 
 Slum village gold still danglin in your ear 
 You barely have a neck but still sportin' a rope 
 Four-finger ring just so Phifer can scope 
 You looked in the mirror, didn't know what to do 
 Yesterday your eyes were brown but today they are blue 
 Your whole appearance is a lie and it could never be true 
 And if you really liked yourself then you would try and be you 
 If your hair and eyes were real, I wouldn't have dissed ya 
 But since it was bought, I had to dismiss ya 
 But if you can't achieve it, then why not try and weave it 
 If you can't extend it then you might as well suspend it 
 If you can't braid it, best thing to do is fade it 
 I asked who did your hair and you tell me ""Diane made it"" 
 If you were you and just you, talk to you, maybe 
 But I can't stand, no bionic lady 
 Tryin' hard to look fly, but yo, you're lookin' dumber 
 If I wanted someone like you I woulda swung with Jamie Summers 
 You wanna be treated right, see Father MC 
 Or check Ralph Tresvant, for sens-a-tiv-i-ty 
 See I am not the one, I got more game than Parker Brothers 
 Phife Dog is on the mic and I'm smooth like Butter"

 I'm movin, yes I'm groovin 'cause my mouth is on the motor

 Can't help bein funky, I'm the funky Abstract brotha 
 Funky in a sense, but I play the undacova 
 Once had a fetish, fetish for some booty 
 Now I'm gettin' funky and my rappin', that's my duty 
 Brothas tend to jock on the style in particular 
 If you got the ego like some brothas, then I'll get with ya 
 But if I don't pursue, then I just don't give a (fuck) 
 My motto in the 90's is be happy makin' bucks 
 Girls love the jim, 'cause it causes crazy friction 
 When it goes up in and fluctuates the diction 
 I still understand the (uh!) 'cause that's what I met her for 
 I'm hooked on the swings, so just call me the music whore 
 Women love the voice, brothas dig the lyrics 
 Quest the people's choice, we thrive it for the spirit

 Write my rhymes straight up, don't get with no fancy stencil 
 The rhymes we get is sweet, we stay away from tart 
 A perfectionist at work, perkin up the art 
 If you want to battle, I suggest you check your clock 
 Your demise is comin' up and I want your man to watch 
 Be the prime example, I deep instilled the sample 
 Insignificance, here I'll place you on the mantle 
 Born up in Harlem, reside down in Jamaica 
 The girl I used to rock, her moms was a claker 
 Now what does that make her? The evil money taker? 
 The crazy move faker, I used that to break her 
 (Vinia Mojica singing in the background) 
 Phife is in the house, Uncle Mike is in the house 
 Bob Power is in the house, Tim Latham is in the house 
 Wise Men is in the house, The Brand Nubes is in the house 
 The Jay Bee, they in the house and De La, they in the house 
 I must regroup my thoughts and kick the next ones for my people 
 Please don't be deceived by ugly slice of evil 
 The world is kinda cold and the rhythm is my blanket 
 Wrap yourself up in it, if you love it, then you'll thank it 
 Don't move to rebuttal, wave your hand for action 
 Some women in the '90's want more than satisfaction 
 They want keys and Gs, and all those illy things 
 If you want to, I'll show you, just what the Ab can bring 
 I keep a tight net with my brothas Ken and Kenny 
 If the question is of rhymes, then I'll tell ya, I got plenty 
 The thing that men and women need to do is stick together 
 Progressions can't be made if we're separate forever 
 I hooked this funky beat with the loop and the feature 
 Is the funky singin' by Miss Vinia Mojica 
 So listen because the Quest is led through the underground 
 My people have been oppressed too long, no more will we be down 
 People tend to riff 'cause they don't know the mental 
 People tend to bug 'cause their beats are hard but gentle 
 Afro kinda lurks through the body of this youngun' 
 Play like Bobby Byrd on your back and your comin' to 
 The house of the jazz, of the funk, of the rhythm 
 All the goods are welcome, but if you're a villain 
 I'll just wait and debate, contemplate your arrival 
 If flexin is your motive, then you don't like survival 
 The Abstract is speakin', the hard beats is reachin' 
 The Black and Puerto Ricans 
 'Cause their butt naked, streakin through the ever murky streets 
 Of the urbanized areas 
 Blastin out the speakers is the hip hop hysteria 
 Craig is in the house, Pete Rock is in the house 
 CL is in the house, Ultra Mag is in the house 
 Nice and Smooth is in the house, Big Daddy Kane is in the house 
 Beatnuts is in the house, Special Ed is in the house 
 Yeah (*7X*) 
 This one goes out to my man 
 Thanks a lot Ron Carter on the bass 
 Yes my man Ron Carter is on the bass 
 Now check it out 
 Born into the 91 decade 
 You gotta say the Quest is on 
 And goddamn it, yes the Quest is on 
 And we out!"
19,A Tribe Called Quest,hiphop,Show Business,"Let me tell you 'bout the snakes, the fakes, the lies, the highs 
 At all of these industry shing-dings 
 Where you see the pretty girls 
 In the high animated world 
 Checking for a rapper with all the dough 
 If you take a shit they want to know 
 And if you're gonna fall, they won't be around, y'all 
 So you still wanna do the show business? 
 And you think that you got what it takes? 
 I mean you really gotta rap, and be all that 
 And prepare yourself for the breaks 
 Check it out! 
 Do you wanna be in the business? (The Business) 
 The ups and downs with the hoes (The Business) 
 Always getting fronted on at shows (The Business) 
 People gotta stick their nose (In the Business) 
 Yo, I gotta speak on the cesspool 
 It's the rap industry and it ain't that cool 
 Only if you're on stage or if you're speaking to your people 
 Ain't no-one your equal 
 Especially on the industry side 
 Don't let the games just glide 
 Right through your fingers, you gotta know the deal 
 So Lord Jamar speak, because you're real... 
 They're giving you the business and putting on a show 
 You're a million dollar man that ain't got no dough 
 But you got a ho tickets backstage to a show 
 Sedated and at that fact they elated 
 Time pass and your ass say ""Where's my loot?"" 
 The reply is a kick in the ass from a leg and a boot 
 All you wanna do is taste the fruit 
 But in the back they're making fruit juice 
 You ask for slack and wanna get cut loose from the label 
 Not able 'cause you signed at the table 
 For a pretty cash advance, now they got a song and dance 
 That you didn't recoup, ""More soup with your meal?"" 
 'Cause this is the real when you get a record deal 
 And I say... 
 Aw shucks, look what the cat hauled in 
 It's Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest, let me begin 
 Like Chuck D, I got so much trouble on my mind 
 'Bout these no-talent artists getting signed, they can't rhyme 
 And if that ain't bad, you got bootleggers 
 Going out like suckers, motherfuckers 
 Feel it's time that I let loose the lion 
 And if not that then I'll commence to head flying 
 Seems in '91 everybody want a rhyme 
 And then you go and sell my tape for only $5.99? 
 Please nigga, I've worked too hard for this 
 No more will I take the booty end of the stick 
 Bogus brothers making albums when they know they can't hack it 
 'Cause they lyrics is played like 8-Ball jackets 
 Now tell me I can't tear it up 
 Go get yourself some toilet paper 'cause your lyrics is butt 
 Do you wanna be in the business? (The Business) 
 People can't walk a straight line in (The Business) 
 Some of these brothers can't rhyme in (The Business) 
 A-yo, I'm tryna get mine (The Business) 
 The party scene is cool, but then again it's all the same 
 You see the same faces, but at different places 
 When you're up and riding high everything is palsy-palsy 
 Get a million pounds and all the skins give you hugs 
 Well that's cool, I can dig it, it really ain't my bag 
 Prefer to max on the side and let my pants sag 
 ""Oh, he's a cutie"", yeah, real cute 
 But I wasn't that cute when I didn't have no loot 
 Although I hit a pound of herbs I'm still nice with the verbs 
 So fuck what you heard 
 The Born Cipher Cipher Master makes me think much faster 
 But critics still continue to plaster 
 My name and discredit my fame 
 All that shit is game 
 And I don't really give a damn 
 Eat from the tree of life and throw away the verbal ham 
 Well, excuse me, I gotta add my two cents in 
 Don't be alarmed, the rhyme was condensed in 
 A matter of minutes so it must be told 
 All that glitters not gold 
 Everybody wants a deal, help me make a demo 
 See my name in bright lights, ride around in a limo 
 My moms keeps beefing (""Boy, get a job"") 
 But I wanna make jams, damn, I know I'll slam 
 Huh, well it's not that easy 
 You gotta get a label that's willing and able 
 To market and promote, and you better hope 
 (For what?) That the product is dope 
 Take it from Diamond, it's like mountain climbing 
 When it comes to rhyming you gotta put your time in 
 Get a good lawyer so problems won't pile 
 You don't wanna make a pitch that's wild"

21,A Tribe Called Quest,hiphop,The Infamous Date Rape,"Classic, classic... 
 Classic example of a... a date rape (4X) 
 Q-Tip: 
 Listen to the rhyme, it's a black date fact 
 Percentile rate of date rape is fat 
 This is all true to the reason of the skeezin 
 You got the right pickin' but you're in the wrong season 
 If you're in the wrong season, that means you gotta break 
 Especially if a squad tries to cry out rape 
 You be all vexed 'cause she got it goin' on 
 You don't wanna fight 'cause you know that you're wrong 
 So instead you rest your head on the arm of the couch 
 Envision in your head of a great sex bout 
 Worthy opponent, all you wanna do is bone it 
 You ask can you kick it, she says you can't stick it 
 This is the case, the situation is sticky 
 Should you try to kiss or head towards a hickey 
 Not even, you can ask Steven 
 If the vibe ain't right, huh, ya leavin' 
 Hit the road Jack and all of that 
 But if she offers her abode, to drop ya load 
 Right smack dab in the middle 
 Get the kitten, I got crazy tender vittles 
 Phife: 
 Uh huh, you know science, you get buckwild 
 Runnin' mad games as if your name was Scott Skiles 
 Or better yet Magic or even Karl Malone 
 Regardless who it is, your aim is to bone 
 If she tries to front, then you start to dis her 
 If she's with the program, that's when you start to kiss her 
 Might as well get to the point, no time to waste 
 Might as well break the ice, then set the pace 
 You start to talk nasty, now she's ready to bone 
 Step out of the shower, throw on cologne 
 All of a sudden, her sugarwalls tumble down like Jericho 
 She's hotter than Meshach, Shadrach and Abendego 
 You listen to After 7, break fool after 10 
 Do your thing at 12 o'clock and when you go again 
 There goes round 1, ding, there goes round two 
 Now tell me what the (fuck) are you supposed to do 
 What do you know, when the meow is completed 
 Girly girl cried rape, yo, I didn't really need it 
 Q-Tip: 
 Sweetheart, we ain't goin' out like that (2X) 
 Sweetheart, we ain't goin' out like that (zulu) 
 We ain't goin' out like that (zulu) 
 We ain't goin' out like that 
 Now baby bust it, if you wanna groove 
 Me and you can do it, it will be the move 
 I won't cry over spilled milk 
 If you won't let me take you to the Hilt 
 I don't wanna bone you that much 
 That I would go for the unforbidden touch 
 I'm not the type that would go for that 
 I'll have to fetch a brand new cat 
 Baby, baby, baby I don't wanna be rude 
 I know because of your bloody attitude 
 I know why you act that way 
 It usually happens on the 28th day 
 I respect that crazily 
 When you're done with the past can you come check me 
 This ain't a joint to disrespect you 
 Because one head ain't better than two 
 Check it out 
 It's a classic example of a... a date..."

 I slayed that body in El Segundo then +Push it Along+

 A special shot of peace goes out to all my pals, you see 
 And a middle finger goes for all you punk MC's 
 'Cause I love it when you wack MC's despise me 
 They get vexed, I roll next, can't none contest me 
 I'm just a fly MC who's five foot three and very brave 
 On job remaining, no I'm chaining 'cause I misbehave 
 I come correct in full effect have all my hoes in check 
 And before I get the butt the jim must be erect 
 You see, my aura's positive I don't promote no junk

 How far must I go to gain respect? Um 
 Well, it's kind of simple, just remain your own 
 Or you'll be crazy sad and alone 
 Industry rule number four thousand and eighty 
 Record company people are shady 
 So kids watch your back 'cause I think they smoke crack

 Q-Tip: 
 Lookin' at Miss Lane, it was the fast lane 
 Barely knows her name, struck by fame 
 She just got a Benz, she rides with her friends 
 Gotta keep her beeper in her purse to make ends 
 Rollin' down the block, checkin' out the spots 
 She winks at the cops, always give her props 
 She knows she's the woman, can't nobody touch her 
 Hangs out for the loot, makes her papes from the gutter 
 Tried to make my moves on Miss Lane, she called me young boy 
 Told her not to dis me I just want to be your love toy 
 You young boy, my love toy, I doubt that very highly 
 Just because you rhyme don't mean I'll let you try me 
 Business oriented, egos never dented 
 Always sweet scented, if it's business, she meant it 
 Distractions never hurt, always did the work 
 Always was alert, she never got jerked 
 Queen of the feats, thrive to compete 
 Love the funky beats while she drive down the street 
 She was justified, couldn't get a job 
 Had to feed her family, so she had to play, then rob 
 Pullin out the ooh wop, listenin to doo-wop 
 You don't have to say a word 
 (Gunshots) That's all ya heard 
 She's not a big kahuna, wish I met her sooner 
 Instead, I met her later, my love is much greater 
 Put me on her roster, to rid her of imposters 
 And to sell the buddah for the sexy drug ruler 
 Love is my motive, now I'm drug promotive 
 Plus I needed duckets to fill up my buckets 
 Supplied me with the squeezy to make my life easy 
 Now I'm missing action for this fatal attraction 
 But don't you let me catch you with your joint up in these bitches 
 And don't you even dare to plan a plot upon my riches 
 'Cause if you play me out, I think I'll let ya be 
 I'll be damned if I let a brotha try to gas me 
 I played my cards well, try to live swell 
 For the G, I would sell, 'cause I was deep in hell 
 But then I really wasn't, she had a fly cousin 
 Who would give me booty on the side of my cutie 
 Elaine, she kinda new, that I would do the do 
 But she didn't tear, I did my work with care 
 That's all that really mattered, he money never splattered 
 As long as she was paid, she was in the shade 
 You can't really blame her for holdin' on a flamer 
 Society taught her, but they didn't tame her 
 A ten clip salute, hunny heres a troop 
 She will never stop until she reach the top 
 Top, top..."

 Captivate the mass, 'cause the prose was profound 
 Do it for the strong, we do it for the meek 
 Boom it in your boom it in your boom it in your Jeep

 I know some brothers wonder, can Phife really kick it? 
 Some even wanna dis me, but why sweat it? 
 I'm all into my music 'cause it's how I make papes 
 Try to make hits, like Kid Capri makes tapes 
 Me sweat another? I do my own thing 
 Strictly hardcore tracks, not a new jack swing 
 I grew up as a Christian so to Jah I give thanks 
 Collect my banks, listen to Shabba Ranks 
 I sing, and chat, I do all of that 
 It's 1991 and I refuse to come wack 
 I take off my hat to other crews that tend to rock 
 But the Low End Theory's here, it's time to wreck shop 
 I got Tip and Shah, so whom shall I fear 
 Stop look and listen, but please don't stare 
 So jet to the store, and buy the LP 
 On Jive/RCA, cassettes and CD's 
 Produced and arranged by the four-man crew 
 And oh shit, Skeff Anselm, he gets props too 
 Make sure you have a system with some fat house speakers 
 So the new shit can rock, from Bronx to Massapequa 
 'Cause where I come from quality is job one 
 And everybody up on Linden know we get the job done 
 So peace to that crew, and peace to this crew 
 Bring on the tour, we'll see you at a theatre nearest you 
 Hey yo but wait, back it up, hup, easy back it up 
 Please let the Abstract embellish on the cut 
 Back and forth just like a Cameo song

 To the music 'cause it's done just for the rhyme 
 Now I gotta scat and get mine, underline 
 The jazz, the what? The jazz can move that ass 
 'Cause the Tribe originates that feeling of pizazz 
 It's the universal sound, bless the brothers on the ground 
 And the ones six below, you didn't have to go 
 Some say that I'm eccentric 'cause I once had an orgy 
 And sometimes for breakfast I eat grits and porgies 
 If this is a stinker, then call me a skunk, I ask 
 ""What's wrong?"" - now check it out

 Uh, so funky (4X) 
 Phife: 
 The batteries I use are called Du-ra-cell 
 They last for three weeks so they do me well 
 Don't be goin' through no phases my joint stays on 
 24-7, from dusk till dawn 
 If you're in Costa Rica on a sunlit beach 
 You greed for the Phifer, I can be reached 
 A number of importance, I just put it on lock 
 You leave code '69"", that means you want some (cock) 
 Q-Tip: 
 People tend to think that a pager's foul 
 Well it kinda is, 'cause it makes me scoul 
 But it really hurts when you're on the prowl 
 Brothas know it hurts when you're on the prowl 
 Grabbin on my joint 'cause I'm an eager owl 
 Get paged by a G or a business pal 
 My shit is overflowin, they won't allow 
 Another page, so I'll just end this now

 But Bo don't know jack, cause Bo can't rap 
 Well what do you know, the Di-Dawg is first up to bat 
 No batteries included, and no strings attached 
 No holds barred, no time for move faking 
 Gots to get the loot so I can bring home the bacon 
 Brothers front, they say the Tribe can't flow 
 But we've been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe so 
 Sleep if you want, NyQuil will help you get your Z's, troop 
 But here's the real scoop 
 I'm all that and then some, short, dark and handsome 
 Bust a nut inside your eye to show you where I come from 
 I'm vexed, fuming, I've had it up to here 
 My days of paying dues are over, acknowledge me as in there (yeah) 
 Head for the border, go get a taco 
 Watch me wreck it from the jump street, meaning from the get-go 
 Sit back, relax and let yourself go 
 Don't front what you heard, but act like you know

 Boom bip with a brother named Tip, and we're ready to flip 
 East coast stomping, ripping and romping 
 New York, North Cak-a-laka, and Compton 
 Checka-checka-check it out 
 The loops for the troops, more bounce to the ounce 
 And wow how now wow how now, Brown cow 
 We're ill till the skill gets down 
 For the flex, next, it's the textbook old to the new 
 But the rest are doo-doo 
 From radio to the video to Arsenio 
 Tell me, yo, what's the scenario 
 (True blue) Scooby Doo, whoopie doo 
 Scenarios, radios, rates more than four 
 Scores for the smores that smother dance floors 
 Now I go for mine, shades of seashore 
 Ship-shape crushed grapes, apes that play tapes 
 Papes make drakes, baked for the wakes 
 Of an L-ah, and -eader, simply just a leader 
 Bass in the space means ""peace, see ya later"" 
 Later (later), later alligator 
 Pop blows the weasel and the herb's the inflator 
 So yo, the D what the O, incorporate I-N-C into a flow 
 Funk flipped flat back first this foul fight fight fight 
 Laugh yo, how'd that sound (ooh) 
 It's a Leader Quest mission and we got the goods here (here) 
 Never on the left cause my right's my good ear (ear) 
 I could give a damn about a ill subliminal 
 Stay away from crime so I ain't no criminal 
 I love my young nation, groovy sensation 
 No time for hibernation, only elation 
 Don't ever try to test the water, little kid 
 Yo Mr. Busta Rhymes, tell 'em what I did 
 I heard you rushed and rushed, and attacked 
 Then they rebuked, then you had to smack 
 Causing rambunction throughout the sphere 
 Raise the levels of the boom inside the ear 
 You know I did it 
 So don't violate or you'll get violated 
 The hip-hop sound is well agitated 
 Won't ever waste no time on the played out ego 
 So here's Busta Rhymes with the scenario 
 Watch as I combine all the juice from the mind 
 Heel up, wheel up, bring it back, come rewind 
 Powerful impact (boom) from the cannon 
 Not bragging, try to read my mind, just imagine 
 Vocabulary's necessary 
 When digging into my library 
 Oh my gosh, oh my gosh 
 Eating Ital Stew like the one Peter Tosh 
 Uh, uh, uh, all over the track, man 
 Uh, pardon me, uh, as I come back 
 As I did it, yo I heard you beg your pardon 
 When I travel through the town, I roll with the squadron 
 Roar, roar, like a dungeon dragon 
 Change your little drawers cause your pants are sagging 
 Try to step to this, I will twist you in a turban 
 And have you smelling ripe like some old stale urine 
 Chickity-choco, the chocolate chicken 
 The rear cock diesel, butt cheeks they were kicking 
 Yo, bust it out before the Busta bust another rhyme 
 The rhythm is in sync (uh) the rhymes are on time (time) 
 Ripping up this dance just like Horatio 
 Observe the vibe and check out the scenario 
 Yeah, my man, motherafucka

 I'm radical with this like the man this song is after 
 Yo Tip settle down, what's the reason for the laughter?

 I really can't say, I guess I laugh to keep from cryin

 Fill 'em with some fantasies and I'll look out like Tattoo

 Okay 
 I am recognizing that the voice inside my head 
 Is urging me to be myself but never follow someone else 
 Because opinions are like voices 
 We all have a different kind 
 So just clean out all of your ears 
 These are my views and you will find that 
 We revolutionize over the kick and the snare 
 The ghetto vocalist is on a state-wide tear 
 Soon to be the continent and then the freakin globe 
 There's room for it all as we mingle at the ball 
 We welcome competion 'cause it doesn't make one lazy or worn

 Try to be the fattest also to stay alive"

 Went to Carvel to get a milk shake 
 This honey ripped me off for all my loot cakes 
 The car oh yeah there's money in my jacket 
 Somebody broke into my ride and cold macked it 
 Yo tip I tell you man the devil's tryin' it 
 But I'm goin' to stay strong 'cause I ain't buyin it 
 Tonight I'm taking Sherry out, I don't have jack to wear 
 You know I gots to look dipped in the fresh new gear 
 Cool I found something so I ironed it 
 I then got caught up on the phone, oh shit I'm fryin it 
 Will someone tell me what did I do to deserve this? 
 I think I'll, pull out my suit for Sunday service 
 My little brother wants Barney, cool I'm gettin' it 
 Took him down to Kay-Bee, they ain't sellin it 
 Here we go with the cryin, yo he's throwin' fits 
 My blood pressure's blowin' up, I can't take the shit 
 Finally got what he wanted now he's good to go 
 Again the ride was smashed, where's my radio? 
 One time the car was in the shop I had to borrow see... 
 They had no mercy on the car Leo will kill me 
 Where the hell can Nicki be? I'm gonna smack her up 
 I got the tickets for the Knicks and she cold stood me up 
 I need to hit a honey off, Jarobi pass the phone 
 Pulled out my book of hoes, oh yo Sheila's home 
 Steady smilin' like a mother yo I'm read' to bone 
 Went down to hon, she's in the red zone 
 Stressed out more than anyone could ever be 
 Forever tryin' to clear the samples for my new LP 
 Everybody knows I go to Georgia often 
 Got on the flight and I ended up in Boston 
 With all these trials and tribulations yo I've been affected 
 And to top it off, Starks got ejected

 Just last week my girl was stressin me 
 Now her best friend be underssin me 
 Well I was lovin' her by the moon ray 
 Now I'm tricking on her like Kinte' (c'mon) 
 Bought a bag of izm from the smoke shop 
 Walkin' towards the car, here come the damn cops 
 Now I'm station bound for the thai sticks 
 I bought it for my man, I don't believe this shit 
 Coach sat me down from the ball team 
 'Cause I was breakin niggaz on the inseams 
 Some niggaz cross town was tryin' to stick me 
 All I had was shorts, a dollar fifty 
 Picked up this girl in the hooptie 
 Just because I rhyme she tried to soup me 
 Pay for this, pay for that, loot for nails and hair 
 Who the hell you think I am, Mr. Belvedere? 
 Go and get a bloody job, then can we look cute 
 Even if you give me boots, you'll neva see my loot 
 She wasn't even all of that just another hooker 
 So I turned that ass away, quick like Chucky Booker 
 Sometimes you got put the hoes in their friggin place 
 Just move from in front me with your bati face!

33,A Tribe Called Quest,hiphop,Midnight,"Q-Tip: 
 The night is my mind 
 The sun'll still shine 
 But the night is on my mind 
 So parlay while I drop this rhyme 
 See, Jake be gettin' illy when the sun get dark 
 They be comin' out the heads, but shit don't let me start 
 Their activities are plenty in nighttime (nighttime) 
 For the ghetto child, it seems to be the right time 
 See, kids be gettin' stuck with jewels and fly gimmicks 
 Shorty see the action and then start to mimic 
 Runnin' to the corner, the dice game is blazin' 
 Lookin' at the loot, it seems so amazin 
 Puts it short down, to be exact would bound 
 He shakes the stones in his hand, then he lets it down (uh!) 
 Scam money don't make none 
 He threw a trip on the ace, now he's out son 
 Hits the local bodega to woof down a hero 
 Son is on a 'Midnight Run' like De Niro 
 Spots the shorty rock standin on his block 
 The thieves be handlin in the pumps, so he asked it it's not 
 Conversation that he kicked to the shorty was a sly one 
 Increased intensity, his dance sure was a fly one 
 Took her to the crib there she ran her gibs 
 About mind upliftment and bein positive 
 He yawned and he sighed till 1:05 
 Then he finally realized that hunny wasn't live 
 At least he didn't plan on buildin for the evenin' 
 Threw the Fila on the dome and said 'Come on yo, we leavin' 
 Came out on the scene as he told her to beep him 
 Saw his man Sam with the blunt in his hand 
 (Aww Shhh...!) You know the transaction 
 Brothas gettin' lost in the weed satisfaction 
 Comin' down the block man loud as (fuck) 
 You would swear Redman was inside the trunk 
 As the night seemed darker, cops is on a hunt 
 They interrupt ya cipher, and crush ya blunt 
 See you left your work at home, so they pat you down for nothin' 
 Why in the hell does 10-4 keep frontin? 
 You push to the park, even though it's still dark 
 The kid is nice on the hoop, he said 'I'll spot ya troop' 
 The night is on my mind 
 The sun'll still shine 
 But now the night is on my mind, the night is on the mind 
 The night is on your mind 
 A yo, the sun'll still shine 
 But now the night is on the mind 
 As for me... 
 I'm a nocturnal animal, God concentrates 
 On a young black man, who makes the niggaz speak a shake 
 The nighttime is busy, it's word to Aunt Kizzy 
 It's the time we get down, yo son, you know the sound 
 The flavas on the top with the rugged beat to back it 
 The night makes the aura and the J can't hack it 
 The way the moon dangles in the midnight sky 
 And the stars dance around, a yo, I think it's fly 
 Intensity, most rappers don't see it 
 Spirit wise, musically, you gotta be it 
 Serenity and sirens of the sounds and emotions 
 In the concrete jungle and the sun don't bungle 
 I think it's hard to find the words on how I feel 
 I paid about a deuce twenty for the Ampex steel 
 But let me slow down, I think I ran my gibs enough 
 Peace out to the Nation, stay rugged and rough 
 The night is on my mind, the sun'll still shine 
 The night is on my mind, the night is on my mind 
 The night is on my mind, yeah, the sun'll still shine 
 But now, uh huh, the night is on my mind 
 The night is on your mind, you know the sun'll still shine 
 But now the night is on the mind, yeah, the night is on my mind 
 The night is on the mind, a yo, the sun'll still shine 
 But now the night is on the mind, yeah, the night is on the mind 
 The night is on the mind, a yo, the sun'll still shine"

 We can, we can get down (both lines 4X)

 It's like that man, it's like that 
 (Rakim from ""My Melody"":""Why waste time on the microphone"") 
 Check it 
 Phife: 
 I'm not your average MC with the Joe Schmoe flow 
 If you don't know me by now, you'll never know 
 Steppin on my critics, beatin' on my foes 
 The plan is to stay focused, only then I can go 
 Straight from the heart, I represent hip hop 
 I be three albums deep, but I don't wanna go pop 
 Too many candy rappers seem to be at the top 
 Too much candy is no good, so now I'm closin the shop 
 Crushin competition like your tires on grapes 
 My rhymes styles be blendin like a Ron G tape 
 My man where ya goin'? You can't escape 
 When the Tribe is in the house, that means nobody is safe 
 How can a reverend preach, when a rev can't define 
 The music of our youth from 1979 
 We rap about what we see, meaning reality 
 From people bustin' caps and like Mandela bein free 
 Not every MC be with the negativity 
 We have a slew of rappers pushin positivity 
 Hip hop will never die yo, it's all about the rap 
 So Marion Barry smokin' crack, let's preach about that 
 The trash you talk won't matter, that old bogus chatter 
 The more that you condemn us, it only makes us phatter 
 When I talk, I know I'm talkin' for you poppers all around 
 You know you love the sound, we gets down 
 Q-Tip: 
 I'm the cherry on the top of yo ice cream 
 I'm the wish you thought inside your dream 
 Listen to the way we pulsate the jam 
 I'm the nigga here with the mic in hand 
 Styles that we present are just a few 
 To do away with you and your hum drum crew 
 This is '93 and the shit is real 
 Black people unite and put down your steel 
 Ladies make a forum on your sexual drive 
 Devoted to your lover and make it thrive 
 The riff was of F, I'm a hip hop body 
 Release the energy like the force of a shotty 
 Standin on the wall with my Polo on 
 Talkin' to the girl with the Liz Claiborne 
 Keep the poetry in my black knapsack 
 Got my Timbo horse and my Doublemint pack 
 Hit the city streets to enhance my soul 
 I can kick a rhyme over ill drum rolls 
 With a kick, snare, kicks and high hat 
 Skilled in the trade of that old boom bap 
 I can do a trick with the opposite breed 
 I used to down 40s and smoke grain weed 
 Now, I'm doin' shows with half loot down 
 Now it's time for me to take ya uptown 
 It's like that man, it's like that (yes!) (7X) 
 It's like this, Shaheed!

 Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down 
 Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down 
 Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down 
 Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized 
 With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs 
 Street poetry is my everyday 
 But yo, I gotta stop when you trot my way 
 If I was working at the club you would not pay 
 Aiyyo, my man Phife Diggy, he got something to say 
 I like 'em brown, yellow, Puerto Rican or Haitian 
 Name is Phife Dawg from the Zulu Nation 
 Told you in the jam that we can get down 
 Now let's knock the boots like the group H-Town 
 You got BBD all on your bedroom wall 
 But I'm above the rim and this is how I ball 
 A gritty little something on the New York street 
 This is how I represent over this here beat 
 Talking 'bout you 
 Yo, I took you out 
 But sex was on my mind for the whole damn route 
 My mind was in a frenzy and a horny state 
 But I couldn't drop dimes cause you couldn't relate 
 Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down 
 Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down 
 Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down 
 Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down 
 Stretch out your legs, let me make you bawl 
 Drive you insane, drive you up the wall 
 Staring at your dome-piece, very strong 
 Stronger than pride, stronger than Teflon 
 Take you on the ave and you buy me links 
 Now I wanna pound the poontang until it stinks 
 You can be my mama and I'll be your boy 
 Original rude boy, never am I coy 
 You can be a shorty in my ill convoy 
 Not to come across as a thug or a hood 
 But hon, you got the goods, like Madelyne Woods 
 By the way, my name's Malik 
 The Five-Foot Freak 
 Let's say we get together by the end of the week 
 She simply said, ""No"", labelled me a ho 
 I said, ""How you figure?"" ""My friends told me so"" 
 I hate when silly groupies wanna run they yap 
 Word to God, hon, I don't get down like that 
 I'll have you weak in the knees that you could hardly speak 
 Or we could do like Uncle L and swing an ep in my jeep 
 Keep it on the down, yo, we keep it discreet 
 See, I'm not the type of kid to have my biz in the streets 
 If my mom don't approve, then I'll just elope 
 Let me save the little man from inside the boat 
 Let me hit it from the back, girl I won't catch a hernia 
 Bust off on your couch, now you got Seaman's Furniture 
 Shaheed, Phife and the Extra P 
 Stacy Beadle, PJ and my man L.G 
 They know the Abstract is really soul on ice 
 The character is of men, never ever of mice 
 Shorty let me tell you about my only vice 
 It has to do with lots of loving and it ain't nothing nice 
 Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down 
 Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down 
 Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down

 Brothas know the flavs when the Quest gets loose 
 Slammin' sucka fuckas like the wrestler Zeus 
 Crazier than Tupac in that flick called Juice 
 Cock is longer than the hat worn by Dr. Seuss 
 Love a girl in Daisy Dukes like them kids called Deuce 
 Gets paid to sex the hoochie like my main man Luke 
 Control the mic like Denzel on the girls 
 Wack MCs be on the nuts like Rocket J. Squirrel 
 The worst thing in the world is a sucka MC 
 Favorite rap group in the world is EPMD 
 Can't forget the De La, due to originality 
 And if I ever went solo, my favorite MC would be me 
 Phife Dawg up in the house, I give a shout out to Snoopy 
 Peace to all the Questers, to hell with the groupies 
 Like um, Ralph up to Potsie, Brooklyn to Dodger 
 Laverne to Shirley, Rerun to Roger 
 Ren to the Stimpy, Laurel to Hardy 
 Q-Tip and Phifer, they mashed up the party 
 Kick the rhymes and more rhymes 
 Kick the beats and more beats 
 We'll have you scratchin in your head, like Shaheed on Technics 
 For those who wanna oppose, just take a stand 
 But for now, just shut your shit and clap your hands 
 (Q-Tip) 
 You just wanna dance man, then clap your hands 
 If you venture up the wrong road, then the circumstance... 
 Will be crucial, I got hundreds of rhymes that'll suit you 
 So listen 
 The Abstract intuition is very very worthy 
 I can feel ya out from Russia to Jersey 
 Can't understand, the underground, it gets deep 
 The low, the Nikes, the links, the jeeps 
 The women, the lingo and all the other goods 
 Peace to the hoods, that keep my shit on play 
 Please don't do the mute when you hear me on the juke 
 Brothas know my angle, it's the Star-Spangled black banner 
 Hook up the beats at the funk manner 
 If want a roll, then dough I be rakin 
 The scope is on the world, 'cause it's mine for the takin' 
 You know I'm gonna do it 
 My shit is rock solid, but it flows like fluid 
 Chemists get confused of my ill composition 
 This is the third of the new Tribe addition 
 MCs be swingin', but alot of them be missin' 
 So shut your bloodclot and listen 
 'Cause I'm bringin' you the ill rendition 
 I'd like to send this out to the L.E.S. 
 Gotta alot of rhythm and style and finesse 
 Come here love, hot sex on a plat 
 And when your done with that then clap

 I'm a black intellect, but unrefined 
 With precision like a bullet, target bound 
 Just living like a hooker, the harlot sounds

 Heat of the equator, the broth that's in the pot 
 Jalick, Jalick ya wind up ya hip 
 Drafting of the poets, I'm the #7 pick 
 Licks licks licks boy 'pon your backside 
 Licks licks licks boy 'pon your backside 
 Listen to the fader, Shaheed lets it glide 
 Tip the earthly body, heaven's on my side 
 Even in Santo Domingo when I got a Gringo 
 We got mics, when do we go? 
 Know a little nigga who can rhyme when you ask me 
 Short, dark, and plus his voice is raspy 
 1 for the treble, 2 for the bass 
 You know the style Tip, it's time to flip this 
 I like my beats hard like two day old shit 
 Steady eating booty MCs like cheese grits 
 My man Al B. Sure, he's in effect mode 
 Used to have a crush on Dawn from En Vogue 
 It's not like honey dip would wanna get with me 
 But just in case I own more condoms than T.L.C 
 Now the formula is this: me, Tip, and Ali 
 For those who can't count it goes 1-2-3 
 The anti batty boy, big up is who I be 
 Brothers find this hard to do but never me 
 Some brothers try to diss but Malik, you see 'em bitching 
 Me no care about them dibby MC, my shit is hitting 
 Trini gladiator, anti-hesitater 
 Shaheed push the fader from here to Grenada 
 Mr Energetic, who me sound pathetic?

 I got a humdinger coming hook line and sinker 
 The Timbo hoofs with the prints on the ground 
 Timbos on the toes, I like the way it's going down 
 Down like a lady of the evening 
 When it goes in Toots just believe it's in 
 'Cause Queens is the county, Jamaica is the place 
 Take off your cleats 'cause you can't run the race

 Aiyyo swing swing swing, to chop chop chop 
 Yo that's the sound when MC's get mopped 
 Don't come around town without the hip in your hop 
 'Cause when the shit hits the fan, that ass'll get dropped 
 MC's wanna attack me but them punks can't cope 
 I'll have you left without a job, like Isaac from The Love Boat 
 So money watch your mouth, or I might have to bust ya 
 Battlin MC's, from JFK to Russia 
 Back down to London, Sweden and Brazil 
 Do a U.S. tour for three months and then a chill 
 Styles be fat like Jackie Gleason, the rest be Art Carney 
 People love the Dawg like the kids love Barney 
 ""I love you, you love me"" 
 The shorty Phife Dawg is your favorite MC 
 So move back yaself dread, you know the element 
 The Tribe is good for your health like a can of Nutriment 
 MC's don't have no winds, MC's don't have no winds 
 I flips you crazier than a busload of Jerry's Kids 
 Your crew don't want it, man your crew don't want it 
 But if you feel you can swing it, then money please bring it 
 (Sup) Large Professor in the house (sup) 
 (Sup) You know how we do (sup)

 Bring the blunts and the brew so 
 Verse Two: Q-Tip 
 Whassup kids? The Ab is speaking from the moon 
 Thanks for your support, aiyyo I'll be home soon 
 But the only thing I ask when I return from my task 
 Is a whole bunch of beats and a Blass full of ass 
 My fist stands firm because I'm, black and solid 
 I open up your pores like a plate full of collards 
 C'mon take it easy wouldya, easy easy 
 I'm up in the gulley, that's when I am her Buddy 
 She told me pull her hair, I did, it drove her nutty 
 Filled up the hole like spackle or I mean putty 
 When we over joints like this we never cruddy 
 Extra P hooked the beat, and kids it feels luh-huh-ovely 
 Check it out, cause my conception is immaculate 
 A bachelor, lookin' for a bachlelorette 
 Back to you MC's, this is what your gonna get 
 A first degree burn from my man Ken's cigarette 
 I hope you like Malboro, Paul you know we thorough like Denver 
 The beat feels like a never-ender 
 But all things good must, so I won't sweat it 
 Drop the C's for the youthful crew, I hope you get it 
 As I stand, grip this mic inside my hand 
 Boy I smack you up, like I was your old grand 
 So respect yourself Son, and come and gimme love 
 Once again the Ab is who you think of 
 So chill with the beef money, we got a Jetti 
 Verse Three: Extra P (Large Professor) 
 It's Extra P and yo Tip I'm bout to set it 
 On the country once again here to win 
 I'm Uptown chillin', takin' in this grand master Vic blend 
 From the projects, the PJ's, fuck them two DJ's 
 Self mission, I had her in the ill position 
 Saying ""Large youse the soul brother that I'd like to 
 Eff with for the rest of my life"" yeah yeah now check the method 
 As I, proceed with what you need like Akinyele 
 A whip looks complete when the tires say Firelli 
 Funk monkey, one rapper fell off, now he's a junkie 
 There's 8 Million Stories in the city it's a pity 
 Don't fuck with the skins if she's trying to act shitty 
 Shout to the Guru, Primo and Zulu Zulu 
 Nation, was on a vacation, in the ghetto 
 Yo Ras slow your roll I'm bout to bag this here's metal

 Needless to say, boy I'm bad to the bone

 Keep it on the corner, 'cause here comes the heat

 Run and tell your dad the Abstract's the bag 
 As we proceed to move your high parts, we know who has ass 
 Poets got the gimmicks, but they lack the sassafras 
 To make the average hardrock and cock the glock 
 And roam the city streets on the jury, they hot 
 I be ingredients, like sugar and candy

 Hook up the beat with the mic and it's over (original, uh!)

 Trials and tribulations that we have to endeavor 
 Brothers know my steelo it's a letter to the better 
 If you see a shorty that you like, then you sweat her 
 Silly with the microphone, in other words I'm loco 
 Six foot zero with my height, complexion cocoa 
 Representin on the mic it seems to be my daily

 Walkin' through the door and all them suckers started haulin 
 Talk a lot of trash but no one can seem to beat it 
 Pull out your microphone and watch the Phifer make you eat it 
 The MC's they get jealy when the girly's on my belly 
 Kick a slow dance like my brother R. Kelly (bust a rhyme) 
 Today's a hip-hop draft will I be top-seeded? (uh) 
 Worked too frickin hard while all the rest were gettin' weeded 
 Steady kickin styles so I can reach that other level (uh) 
 Don't worry about gettin' gassed I push the pedal to the metal 
 Always wanted this cause it surely beats a scramble (right) 
 I'm Jordan with the mic, huh, wanna gamble? (mmm)

 Poetry machine with correct mechanisms 
 Immune to disease I defeat organisms 
 That are waitin in my path, I overstep the critters 
 Give your ass the willies and your moms'll get the jitters (uh) 
 Winners turn to losers, losers are forgotten 
 Tangle in my fore with, hopes that I stop rockin' 
 Never will that happen only if it is permitted (uh) 
 Wait... I think somebody shitted (c'mon) 
 I guess that will be me 'cause I'm the only one MCin

 But see, I create sounds that make your ears go numb 
 Peace to Sayers Ave., yeah you know how we go 
 My best friend Steven at the Home Depot 
 Lowerton is in the house, I can't forget Southside 
 Walk past MC's like that girl did the Pharcyde 
 I'm labeled as the cat's meow, the MC with the know-how 
 Act like you know, not now, but right now 
 Beast of the East, on MC's I have a feast 
 I'd eat that ass like quiche, crack a smile like Shanice 
 Straight out Jamaica scene, Jamaica, Queens 
 But you could find me out in Georgia, or anywhere in between 
 Now if my partners don't look good, Malik won't look good 
 If Malik don't look good, the Quest won't look good 
 If the Quest don't look good, then Queens won't look good 
 But since the sounds are universal, New York won't look good 
 Picture Phife losin a battle, come on, get off it 
 Put down the microphone son, surrender forfeit 
 Did I hear somethin' 'bout a crew? What they wanna do? 
 You better call Mr. Babyface, so he can bring out _The Cool in You_ 
 Or it'll be a sad love song being sung by Toni Braxton 
 And I'll dissect you like a fraction 
 Oh, you wannabe top cat MC's, I'll pop you like a zit 
 You wanna be the champ, you more like Chief Some-shit 
 Big up myself every time when it comes to this 
 MC's be runnin' scared as if they're watchin the Exorcist 
 I kick more game than a crackhead from Hempstead 
 My styles are milk, man, you'd think that I was breast fed 
 You know the steelo when the diggy Dawg is on the scene 
 I dedicate this to all the MC's outta Queens 
 That goes for Onyx, LL, Run-D.M.C.

 You need a chart, straight up and down man, there ain't no other 
 Nuff respect to all my peeps that made the album cover

 You know I'm on the other, for the top 40 
 Haha, you gotta do it like this... 
 We got the funk doody don shit, clearly it's the bomb shit 
 So recognize me, kids memorize me 
 Everyday, I be scroungin, really, I be loungin 
 I play the down low, very very incognito 
 Aries is my sign, I know that I can rhyme 
 Sometimes I rhyme in riddles, plus I make the hunnies wiggle 
 Intellect is the major, some heads like to wager 
 The skills on the hill, overlookin dollar bills 
 Man, ya crazy, thinkin' you can phase me 
 The Ab doesn't study near nonsense money 
 Life seems to meet me, MC's seem too cheesy 
 With they doody ass renditions of defeatin competition 
 I rock to the roll man, yes, I'm a soul man 
 Bet'cha bottom dolla, Vinia will make ya holla 
 As ya stand at attention, did I forget to mention 
 MC's will give me twenty, if I sense that they act funny 
 Lyrics are abundant, right there, I sound redundant 
 Just mentionin the fact, that the area is fat 
 I dwell in the unda, so hunny, it's no wonder 
 That I get plenty of tail, well I even get white 
 I'ma bet hittin head crack, there money, take that 
 Breakin niggaz off, cut their bank, then I'm off 
 While my Nik'es match my lil hat, beat joint is mad fat 
 Got the cutter of the box if a kid thinks he's ox 
 For tier means creator, the poetry relator 
 It's hemp, like Betsy Ross, let me tell you who's the boss

42,A Tribe Called Quest,hiphop,Phony Rappers,"Intro: Kamaal (Q-Tip) 
 Phony rappers who do not write 
 Phony rappers who do not excite 
 Phony rappers, check it out, aight 
 Verse One: Kamaal (Q-Tip) 
 Yo, I was riding the train 
 And this Puerto Rican kid said simple and plain 
 Let's battle - it kinda took me by surprised 
 'Cause the brother was moving wit his eyes on the prize 
 I said screw it, I ain't got nuttin to lose but um 
 But I got to do this shit real quick so um 
 Hurry up kid, bust your joints and then I'll bust mine 
 And I be out 'cause I got to see this hottie, he said ok 
 Now check it, check it out, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, that's what he said 
 Then I came back and just fucked up his head 
 'Cause yo, he thought an MC who was seen on TV 
 Couldn't hold the shit down in New York City 
 Aiyyo, I showed his ass, then I went off on my task 
 To bless her ass Uptown, real MC's will hold it down 
 Yeah, yeah, sonny, to the beat like that 
 You wanna bring it to me, where you at 
 Verse Two: Phife Dawg 
 Yes, dread, I had a similar situation 
 When this kid tried to tell me I didn't deserve my occupation 
 He said I wasn't shit that I was soon to fall 
 I looked him up and down, grab my crotch and said balls 
 Of course he tried to bring it on the battling tip 
 Ay, you know me, you know I had to come out my shit 
 Trying to lounge at the mall, meet Skef and Mr Walton 
 Finally I banged his ass wit the verbal assault 
 He said a rhyme about his .45 and his nickelbags of weed 
 That's when I preceded to give him what he needed 
 Talking 'bout I need a Phillie right before I get loose 
 Poor excuse, money please, I get loose off of orange juice 
 Preferly Minute Maid 'cause that's exactly what it takes 
 To write a rhyme, huh, to school your nickels and your dimes 
 Because an MC like me be on TV 
 Don't mean I can't hold my shit down in NYC 
 Phony rappers who do not write 
 Phony rappers who do not excite 
 Phony rappers, you know they type 
 Phony rappers, check it 
 Verse Three: Phife, Consequence 
 It seems there's a sanitation yard full of trash talkers 
 Sounding good but money can you feed the dog hawker 
 Talking 'bout your mic days and your breakdancing 
 Not enhancing, you sound tired 
 Oh, shit, I didn't know you like to play yourself in front'cha friends 
 Sitting there, lying to no end 
 MC's for me make things happening 
 Talk about a world but in a form of rapping 
 Who will be the captain of this ship 
 If it goes down, don't you know you have to go wit it 
 Just because you rhyme for a couple of weeks 
 Doesn't mean that you've reach the MC's peak 
 Let me stop sounding all bitter 
 Ghetto child, never be a quitter 
 But don't be a phony in the litter 
 Take it as a letter from the better 
 Take it from a man who used to rhyme in busted ass jetta's 
 C: Yo, Phife, you need a condom 
 P: Word to God, mess around 
 I catch AIDS from MC's being on my nuts too hard 
 C: 'Cause on my blvd you better bring your bodyguard 
 P: And what's your blvd 
 C: LB, I represent naturally 
 P: So don't step on the rolly if you know that you're phony 
 Or else I bend that ass like elbow macaroni 
 'Cause I gotta keep it real (gotta keep it real) 
 A Tribe Called Quest, you see we never half step 
 C: (So on your mark) get ready, MC's be jetti 
 Me and Phifey be on ya like Veronica and Betty 
 Archie, Jughead, snuffing MC's 
 From Brainslane down to Hempstead 
 P: Yes 'Quence, see over 
 His rhyme style is older that a Chrysler Cordoba 
 I'm wilder then the cats from Arizona 
 Villanova, un, un, Kentucky 
 Whos' the next MC stepping up to try and bust me 
 Bring him here and boy, will I ever let him have it 
 C: And when it comes to the microphone, don't even try to grab it 
 What?"
43,A Tribe Called Quest,hiphop,Get A Hold,"Intro (fading in): Drifting, drifting, drifting, drifting, drifting, 
 Drifting, drifting, drifting, drifting by, totally. Drifting 
 By (just) totally. Drifting by (just) totally 
 Q-Tip: 
 The deadly venom, let me start from the beginning 
 We always hittin, so yo, there'll be no extra innings 
 As I send the mic out the park like Reggie Jackson 
 You be the minor leaguer who sees no action 
 The coming attraction (what!) 
 The main feature 
 And I'm a greet ya, like a rhymin ass creature 
 Lurking all up in the dark, unknown parts 
 The brotha well prepared is the brotha who will start 
 And that's me Aqui, as long as the ladies move they bodies 
 We'll have a forum to stand 
 'Cause that happens to be the nature of man 
 Sexuality, it is the format baby 
 Ain't no ifs, no buts, no ands, or maybes 
 But I praise Lord in the worlds that's unseen 
 Respect me for that and let me do my thing (just) 
 I said, respect me for that and let me do my thing 
 (Drifting by) You know we gotta get a hold 
 (Suddenly) Over the illest drum rolls 
 (Suddenly drifting by just...) 
 Yo, how you doin'? Let me give you an intro 
 My name's the Abstract, now let me give you some info 
 Got the diamond in the back, and the sunroof shit 
 That makes the hardcore MCs resort to being bitch 
 And I don't give a shit about being wild rich 
 Just make me comfortable and I'll deal with it 
 Your lust for the riches make a nigga feel sick 
 Down to his zealots, upchuck and then spit 
 Denouncin my beliefs, well then your wig get split 
 Lay your ego on the ground so that you'll benefit 
 You can take these words and relay it to your click 
 Take some time for your mind and get off them head trips 
 Don't try to play me, see my name's not dick 
 The Tribe is the crew that makes your mics get lit 
 Like the Fourth of July on some firework shit 
 My record company be on some true jerk shit 
 But that's i-ight. Now, I'm on some true work shit 
 And I'ma make it happen for my whole outfit 
 (Drifting by) You know we got to get control 
 (Suddenly) Over the illest drum rolls 
 (Suddenly drifting by just...) Third verse 
 A-yo, we just gettin' started 
 Got to redirect this vision 
 Got the beauty of a flower 
 Plus dimensions like a prism 
 Your minds are locked down like prison 
 Y'all really need to go lay down 
 'Cause positivity has risen 
 We hittin 
 Yo bust how we too strong to be broken 
 Occasional malfunction pressure time 
 We ain't jokin 
 For security we on this run like Logan 
 Kamaal's doin' the hustle 
 And you backstage voguin 
 We all got flaws 
 Don't ever try to think that you perfect 
 We all are human beings 
 There's bullshit at the surface 
 Sometimes, I mean we rhyme 
 Damn, we ain't prophets 
 And if you think so, you need to stop it 
 So jump back inside your shell 
 Let your million dollar thoughts propel 
 But next man don't get jel 
 Playa hate that all carries weight 
 That we don't need 
 We slim with disabilities and 
 Thick with possibilities 
 'Cause then you can't move with agility 
 Navigatin with good visibility 
 We put these tunes out in record shop facilities 
 Let's strive to get this constant money activity 
 We try to stay on the scene like Fidel 
 So if you get enraged with these names it still rebels 
 There ain't no plan B's 
 Yo watch, we movin through with plan A 
 Money market doin' things the right way 
 (Suddenly) You know we got to get control 
 (Drifting by, just) Over the illest drum roll 
 (Suddenly drifting by just...) (x3) 
 (Suddenly just (x2), Drifting by (x2) in background) 
 Yo bust it out section, section. 
 Section Linden Boulevard 
 Section on Merrick 
 Section the whole Jamaica 
 Section on Flushing 
 Section in Bed-Stiduy"
44,A Tribe Called Quest,hiphop,Motivators,"We be the number one motivators 
 Ghetto mentality and the innovators 
 Some of y'all may really hate us 
 But we won't be soft, all we wanna do is rock 
 Phife: 
 We be the crew that presents it on wicked instrumental 
 Damagin your mental, from here to Sacramento 
 This here groove was made for vintage freestylin 
 Feelin' like I'm chillin' on a Caribbean island 
 Rugged, raw material is what we bring forth 
 A Tribe Called Quest, we representin up North 
 What's that you're sayin' in the back, actin' all silly 
 Kickin freestyle raps, rollin' up phillies 
 Q-Tip: 
 It's the four man fiasco in charge like Roscoe 
 Now you get the picture like Picasso 
 We make it happen when these niggaz start rappin' 
 Who this, captain? 
 Stick out your hand, you gets no dap and... 
 I got the Razor, got the Phife, I got the Shaheed 
 Now all you shorties move your ass while you puff weed 
 Blessin fans with autographs in my paths 
 While other rappers get gassed, they be defeating the task 
 Consequence: 
 Yo, if I ruled the world 
 It wouldn't be that gassed shit, niggaz will make the light swirl 
 'Cause after you G, ain't nothin' but Girl... Scouts 
 And I'mma show you what it's all about (ah yeah) 
 Is what you say when my love is in your mouth 
 Without a doubt, I cut MCs like the cord 
 'Cause I does more than that MC from The Lords 
 While you be froggin like Bud-wei-ser 
 And rappin' is what you slackin' in 
 I'm knockin' MCs outta action like abstinance 
 Rockin' since kiss my dick was kickin ass 
 Peachfuzz, 'cause... you might be on drugs

 To all my people across the state who sit back and contemplate 
 Motivate, I motivate 
 To all my people across the land who get their feet stuck in sand 
 Motivate, I motivate y'all 
 Consequence: 
 A yo, I speak with something new but not Granddaddy I.U. 
 Stay tuned, live from the L-B-Q 
 A yo, it's destined St. John, I swing on your block 
 You know how I get down like Heather B. with them glocks 
 I came to lead my team to victory like Hayden Fox 
 'Cause heads ain't ready for the willie I got 
 Ya naw'mean slim, I dug my thing like them grim 
 Leavin' crews in state of black and blue like Rakim 
 And if you don't know, you better ask another 
 It's like 192 when we rollin' deep cover 
 So don't shut down on the Razor 
 'Cause in the 9-Live we steppin through hotter than the Trail Blazers 
 And in Queens, I be a legend like Richard Dean 
 Son, I gotta team that Hakeem couldn't dream 
 While you be standin sellin, Queens keep it live 
 Who the hell you tellin' (Kim from the Tribe) 
 Phife: 
 Let me tell you why I be the top dog in the industry 
 Because all these so-called mutts are not seein me 
 They too busy eatin cycles 1, 2 and 3 
 They can't MC, I'd rather be down with fuckin' Droopy D 
 My style is deadly, word bond, act like you fuckin' know 
 Been writin rhymes ever since Ray Parker sang with Radio 
 You're style is played out like a two-tone down goose 
 You couldn't Converse if you had fuckin' react juice 
 So hold your corner as I fuckin' bless this mic in here 
 I'm eatin through your crew like Stephen King's ankle layers 
 Chop off my feet, word to God, I'm gonna hurt you 
 (Will y'all fall off?) Will Laura fuck Urkel? 
 Never, here comes the funk, smell the aroma 
 Kid, my shit's the bomb, ask my peeps from Oklahoma 
 Q-Tip: 
 To all my people across the state who sit back and contemplate 
 Motivate, I motivate, I motivate y'all 
 To all my people across the land who get stuck in great sand 
 Motivate, I motivate y'all 
 To all my peoples everywhere throw your mitts in the air 
 Motivate, motivate, motivate, motivate 
 Can't do nothin' for your frontin, get involved and do somethin' 
 Motivate, motivate, I motivate, I motivate, I moti..."
45,A Tribe Called Quest,hiphop,Jam,"Featuring Consequence 
 (Girls talking on phone) 
 Q-Tip: 
 It was Friday afternoon in the middle of June 
 Heineken bottle caps and the aroma of boom 
 Around the time everybody had just got home from class 
 Shootin dice, talkin' shit, hopin the cash would last 
 Yo, this was around the time when I didn't know no better 
 Juney moved around in a tinted out Jetta 
 Phife: 
 Then he introduced me to that hydro smoke 
 Then I took one toke, yo, I almost choked 
 See I never smoked before and my nerves got shot 
 Then he told me about the party at the spot jam rock 
 It was guaranteed on but I said ""son, chill"" 
 There's a joint around the way that's supposed to be real 
 Word 
 Q-Tip: 
 He said we got no Js, so we gonna do it right 
 Hit your man's joint first, then jam rock at one night 
 Then I said ""aight"", then I jumped inside the jetty 
 Let me take a shower, I'm sweaty, and then I'll be ready 
 Tonight is the night I get my groove on steady 
 And get my drink on with that Ford named Betty 
 I went upstairs to get fly, broke my tie 
 On some liquor, to meet my high quicker 
 Now, I'm tight, them know, the party is the M. O 
 Me and my crew, we get it started like a demo 
 Eleven in the evenin, I'm feelin' like a heathen 
 This thing is goin' down and I highly doubt I'm leavin' 
 Booty cheeks start to motion and the kids is drinkin' potion 
 Word is bond, that Black Moon joint got me open 
 (Don't front) 
 Consequence: 
 A yo, the DJ put this short groove on 
 The good shit that makes a kid lose his drink 
 Blendin Risin' to the Top and got these shorties hoppin 
 Nothin' but coppin, ain't no stoppin' me now 
 Yo, I'm bound to win until that thing kicked in 
 The Alazay had me drunk, I don't know where to begin (echoed) 
 Phife: 
 Not I'm feelin' kinda jaded, wildly coherent 
 Me and the fellas acted very irreverent 
 Butt grabbin, mad laughin' and assin 
 Consequence: 
 When that chick caught up, the shorty lookin' fed up 
 They say you drug one with this one, gibbin with that one 
 Q-Tip: 
 A yo, I'm just doin' my thing, yo I'm just havin' fun 
 You don't see me in here wylin pullin out no gun 
 Yo, I see some of that thing girl and I want some 
 So let's step inside this corner so that we can rap on 
 Over this bumpin ass song and some Dom Perignon 
 Phife 
 I hit ya with the good lovin' plus fillet mignon 
 (Yeah, yeah scrammy scrams, yo, that's that same old song)

 I've been partyin and drinkin' since I came out my door 
 Q-Tip (Consequence) 
 Look at these kids about to mix it, damn, where's the exit? 
 (Son, jetted to the ride and got the burner out the Lexus) 
 Yo, he cocked his joint back like he's about to let him have it

 About the cats who be fronting 
 You know the Tip, he be huntin 
 For all the goodness gracious 
 All across the wide spaces 
 Yo, check it out, 
 Bust me down, yo 
 Yo... yo... 
 Youse my peoples, why it got to come down to this shit 
 Two people thinking as one so now he split 
 Remember what I said to you, you bleed, I bleed 
 C'mon, you know how we get down, if you're down, you need 
 And I'm supplying, the dynamic duo, electricfying 
 Everybody had to wet us, 'cause no one will forget us 
 Son, I testify sure as God was my guide 
 Any petty little bullshit you did will slide 
 Same on my end, after all, what are we, friends 
 If niggaz ran me this, too much grounds we defend 
 In the honor or brotherhood 'cause it's all good 
 Get on some grown man shit and let's knock on wood 
 But now seeing you baby in this stall out position 
 Wondering who's the dime piece that you're kissing 
 You night as well take the jigger and take my life 
 'Cause the dime piece you happen to be kissing is my wife 
 Shit, I should have know not to let these crab asses 
 Get within the circle of my girl and make passes 
 Now you disrespected me and everything I stand for 
 (But I'm saying though, son) Shhh, say no more 
 Allah forgive me, my thoughts is traveling to low desires 
 Should I turn the other cheek or react and perspire 
 Don't wanna see myself in penitentiary attire 
 But I caught him in the act and my emotion is dire."
47,A Tribe Called Quest,hiphop,The Pressure,"(Q-Tip) 
 In this American metropolis filled with MC's 
 A Tribe Called Quest came to drop jewels wit' ease 
 Plus make you party, we do this music thing for everybody 
 Black, White, Latino and Asian, we cold raisin' 
 The stakes of hip-hop to a new plateau 
 To bridge gaps in generations for future plantations 
 A god-fearin' folk 'cause we all from the yolk 
 Of one breed, one seed, to good goals we proceed 
 Nowadays I strive to be a very good influence 
 Even though not too long ago I was a truant 
 Now I'm droppin' it on this and many broad topics 
 From man's obsession with money to holy prophets 
 Like Mohammed, yo, you know the scene is so freaky 
 Enemies they denounce me and my own try to sweep me 
 Now I got hip-hop acts posin' like fat cats 
 Lex and a Rolex, Moet and a top hat 
 But what about your contract, slick? Is you proper? 
 It's time we turned the tables of this hip-hop fable 
 I be strivin yo', tryna bang these joints out my skillet 
 And fulfil it, think about these kids, we can't kill it 
 (Phife) 
 Now every dog has his day, but eff that, it's my year 
 All you gat pullin' MC's could never come near 
 All that bogus type chatter, please put it to rest 
 It's the Phifer from Quest leavin' venues a mess 
 So I even start to (Rap) when you know you have no (Haps) 
 Wit' your simpleton (Lyrics), your light-hearted (Act) 
 Step back, me no have no time for dat 
 I'm blowin' up the spot for all you ras clot idi-ots 
 In a world where you have like a zillion MC's 
 Ninety percent of all you suckers have filthy LPs 
 Bitch this, trick that, come on, act like you know 
 I be that up north MC who never chose to play the down-low 
 (His name is Phife Dawg) I label myself as The Boss (True dat) 
 Same height as Little Vicious, yet I'm shorter than Kriss Kross 
 Queens representation, son, you know how we do 
 While Light' and Sha, they represent BK to the fullest 
 I be the sidekick to The Abstract, so get ready for combat 
 Yo, what about about them biters? Errr! Me not like that 
 My motto is to wreck shop, I do it on the non-stop 
 Come on party people, you must give me my props 
 'Cause y'all know good and damn well that the style has been mastered 
 So head for the border you peasy-haired bastards 
 Before I start to put it on ya, come on now, must I warn ya? 
 Queens is in the house so all MC's go hold their corner 
 We feelin' pressures in here 
 You know we feelin' pressures 
 Feelin' pressures in here

 Watch me bust they shit 
 OK 
 Oh, you did it to me once again my friend 
 I swear you do it to me every time 
 'Cause you stay crazy on my mind 
 Yo you got it goin' on (say word), on and on and on 
 On and on and on 
 This is the year that I come in and just devastate 
 My style is great ask your peoples can I dominate? 
 My rhymes are harder than last night's erection 
 Don't play me close, I'll have this mic up in your mid-section 
 My shit is lovely simply meaning that my joint is tight 
 Amping up the mic making sure production's tight 
 Sometimes I might catch a severe case of writer's block 
 But by the end of the day you'll be on my jock 
 My name's Malik my hobby's putting MC's to the test 
 And if you front I'll put my foot up in your freaking chest 
 Freestyle fanatic, and never will it ever stop 
 You crew is loose, you might just want to call the cops 
 Aye, yo I gotta put some action on paper 
 Make sure my verse jump up and spread out like the raper 
 The only tip I got for a waiter 
 Is watch the doorknob hit me where the dirty dog shoulda' bit me 
 That was my train of thought, but for so long I fought 
 Now I'm at a level supreme to the devil 
 So turn up the bass and lay low on the treble 
 We be the real MC's and you dead, bring a shovel 
 Revitalize, the vital Tribe nigga, WHAT? 
 The ladies sweat the style like the squirrel sweat the nuts 
 You know a fellas good for the moola 
 Don't smoke no woolas, read the name call me Slick Tip the Ruler

 'Cause you stay crazy on my mind 
 Yo you got it goin' on (say word), on and on and on 
 On and on and on 
 Yo I've been treading on this globe man for twenty-five joints 
 Sometimes Shaitan got me by the pressure points 
 But I can break a fella down like sex 
 You eat Wheat Chex but still light in the ass and can't flex 
 If one nigga front I'mma make more pay 
 'Cause tonight, we gettin' off like O.J 
 And yo I got a Dawg that bites, fuck the barking 
 Yo I got a crew with the beats and the smarts and 
 I fought my shit up on Linden in the one-nine-two 
 Forever writing never biting ain't shit else to do 
 Hoping to battle, but most MC's ain't ready yet 
 But if they utter one word then it's as good as set 
 You have MC's dropping bombs that's incredible 
 Some of the brothers, their styles are just despicable 
 As for me see I just do how I love to do 
 Try to deny me of my props then I'll be seeing you 
 Most of you suckers wanna be down for the tag along 
 The freaking fame, someone tell 'em that this shit ain't games 
 You gots to do this from your heart meaning your inner soul 
 And if it's real only then will you be on a roll 
 I try to stay on top my game there ain't no time to lose 
 Four albums deep as a Quester but still we payin' dues 
 So hear me out one time, you gots to be yourself 
 'Cause if you ain't yourself you end up by your freaking self 
 I'm coming rugged with the Linden Boule type of slang 
 And yo, we'll see who can hang yo

 Q-Tip: 
 Your new lesson is to realize the mission when you hear it 
 MCin, see I got this in my spirit 
 I got verses like Mahalia singin' church hymns 
 So strap up because you skatin on ice that's wild thin 
 A weak foundation doesn't make a good home 
 That's why mine is built on chrome microphones 
 We bout to do it theoretically, and steadibly, to the medley 
 Come on 
 It's the complete Kamal, unique, Fareed, breed 
 That'll keep you broke down like a horse 5 speed 
 So move buddy, a yo we got to get this money 
 In this land of dead and crummy, ain't a damn thing funny 
 A yo, shout out to Mobb Deep, the Extra P 
 Busta Rhymes, De La, the J Beez, so don't sleep 
 We got reality for the carriage 
 Stayin sincere to this, so I know we gonna manage 
 Give me, liberty in mass amounts and Swiss bank accounts 
 With the sustainer, it'll be real 
 So me and my brothas, we can sit down and build 
 Like Rampage with that Last Boy Scout appeal 
 We got that silk, satin, Manhattan intelligence feel 
 That keeps everything on even keels 
 So all you slow brothas talkin' yang, ya poo tang

 To watch them niggaz Fall like Lin'que 
 I keeps it brand new like school shoppin'

 The club peeps this nigga's steez like radars

 It's stale, you'll either be dead or in jail 
 I keeps it realer than the logo on milk 
 Denouncin tough guy wannabes that look smoother than silk 
 That's the sound of the man gettin' yanked off the stage 
 Tryin' to front like he mad paid 
 Suckin so bad, we threw his mama off the train (insane) 
 MCs are just givin' it all away (OK) 
 Who said him know about the Quest type sound? 
 Mess around and get your ass knocked down (clown) 
 I dedicate this to the posers that play hard 
 You wanna hear some rhymes, well then bring your bodyguard 
 So he can peep the worldwide Willie that we display 
 Leavin' all MCs in complete disarray

 Yea, move your body, decide to party 
 'Bout to bring it to you kid like we never ever did 
 My nigga Al G in it, my nigga Shaheed in it 
 We got the girl Kristine in it, got my man Big G in it 
 Hey, yo, inside the ghetto or in a sunny meadow 
 I'ma make you move whether woman or fellow 
 Yo, I got the medals in the warfield of respect 
 Like an ill porno make ya body get wet 
 Just a ghetto child trying to live a straight and narrow 
 Hoping that my shit will pierce your dome like an arrow 
 I'm sure it will, especially if it's God's will 
 MC's be ready to die 'cause I'ma kill 
 All you negative feelings standing on two feet 
 While I make the hotties move to the hip-hop beat 
 You know what's really killer, realer than you can imagine 
 Using every source of pain in my range to make it happen 
 If I make it happen, that means I'm making motion 
 And I'm doing my thing causing an ill commotion 
 Everybody do the hop, niggaz soothe like lotion 
 I lay up in the piece or an incognotion 
 You gotta do the hop then move to the beat, you don't stop 
 Now everybody here, you do the hop 
 You going up to cop, a town full of brick, don't stop 
 You gotta come back and do the hop 
 Yo, fuck the cop, you gotta come back and do the hop

 C'mon, you know I'm crazy nice (nice, nice)

 You'se a corny muthafucka 
 You must be high smoking dust wit Chris Tucker 
 You f-----asses don't want this 
 I pull more beeps than the beep at the premier of Pocohantas 
 Word is born, I am the baddest 
 And all you honies out there, word is born, you know my status 
 So come and pull your panties down 
 This ain't no Barnum and Bailey show, I don't get down wit the clowns 
 So why don't you and your friends, get wit me and my friends 
 But don't bring your ass buying you ain't got no ends 
 Word is born, it don't stop (stop, stop, stop...) 
 Just ease your mind, come along and do the hop

 Hip hop... a way of life 
 It doesn't tell you how to raise a child or treat a wife 
 I verbalize over... rhyme friendly 
 That puts a listener in a frenzy, so pop me in your Benzi 
 You dig it? Get wit it or get your melon splitted 
 If you ever try to combat, Sir Walter moves the king 
 We got the illy team that doesn't even sweat the gleam 
 Or glamour, we'll figure 4 your ass like Greg the Hammer 
 Man, we rockin' joints like The Who or Santana

 Retrace, won't, so your stubborn like groupies 
 Kid, you know my flava, tear this whole jam apart 
 Fuck around and have your heart, like Jordan had Starks 
 While you playin' hokey pokey, there's no time to be dokey 
 'Cause I come out to play every night like Charles Oakley 
 Dissin around with wack rhymin 
 You lose your grip from chalk climbin 
 Let me take this time to say R. I. P. to Phyllis Hyman 
 Who never got the props that she damn well deserved 
 But see me, you don't wanna see me, 'cause all MCs are gettin' served 
 The nerve, for you to even step to the Phifer 
 I'll bumrush your set and crush your whole cypher 
 Reserve, a spot for me in hip hop's hall of fame 
 'Cause rappin' ain't no game, big up your head and maintain 
 Yeah, Queens forever in this piece crushin any beef 
 Ain't nothin' sweet, the bakery's across the fuckin' street

 My nana, that's where I got my spiritualism 
 As for Tip and Shah, they made me stop from smokin' izm 
 Now, when I'm with some cheese, I be lettin off gism 
 Writin rhymes since Daddy Kane and Biz Mark was on Prism 
 I gotta brave heart like the one named Shirley Chisholm 
 As for my late twin, boy, I wish I was with him 
 Got the Lightro in the back talkin' bout (come on, get him) 
 And when it comes to rhymes, no doubt, I flip em 
 Sucka MC in my path, hey main, I say we ship him 
 Money please, your rhymes are wack, say word, this geek is trippin' 
 Just because my name is Phife, my man, I'm never slippin 
 I got the type of flave to have your ass straight bitchin 
 For those who act cute, see I got them on mute 
 Have you walkin' through your projects in your birthday suit 
 'Cause your style is off loot, so I played him like a flute 
 If youse a sucka MC, then it's you I rebuke 
 My style is, everday all day, similar to water 
 Crushin MCs as if my name was Sargent Slaughter 
 Keep shit hotter... than a sauna 
 Or better yet, the hormones on your Christian daughter 
 Hey, I tried to warn her 
 My sounds the type to kill, like the grill on Lauryn Hill 
 So all ya sucka MCs, y'all best go chill 
 Bout to go to Union Square so I can see my care bear 
 Singin' good stuff in my ear, runnin' fingers through my hair 
 Represent the Zulu Nation with illy rap creations 
 Just keep shit hotter than Death Row-Bad Boy confrontations 
 Chillin' with Fudge Love because he represents the Haitians 
 Ya naw'mean

53,A Tribe Called Quest,hiphop,Separate/Together,"Sometimes men and women look at themselves and see bliss 
 Through experience we tend to exist 
 That's through our past or our caretakers 
 The instance is in particular, so you need to recognize that 
 If you take all this away 
 And look at us at the end of the day 
 We stand great among creation 
 So baby take these words as a little inspiration 
 While I kick this shit get your ass motivation 
 MCs, you're walking a thin line 
 Get in your ranks and tighten up as we walk through mines 
 And plus vipers, phony rhymers and biters 
 Money-grubbers, beat-dubbers 
 Amongst a whole host of others 
 Who be fakin', fraudulatin' 
 Waitin' for your bacon 
 They be takin' and skatin' while you sit contemplatin' 
 Who's your peoples 
 Well let me tell you somethin' now paw 
 We're livin' a world that's R-A-double-raw 
 It's crazy but it's true, go for delly is the law 
 And if you cross the path then you dangerin' your jaw 
 And if you Glass Joe, don't go toe-for-toe 
 Yo all we wanna do is our thing and lay low 
 So brothers hold your heads high when you get down 
 Don't violate these women 'cause we need them around 
 It's all of us together, not the one without the other 
 The Abstract is ill, word to mother 
 We got to do our do, not separate, together 
 Got to move on through, not separate, together 
 Got to do our do, not separate, together 
 Got to move on through, not separate, together 
 Yo, we got some problems baby 
 People stressed out, check it 
 But we can make it Sugar

 The MCs are really lost and it's at a big cost 
 We be rhymin at our show thinkin' we gettin' dough 
 Movin throught every town off the fumes of... 
 And accolades of the crowd with our chests out proud 
 Yo, we bout to pack these joints so that these... sound loud

 Son, we livin' in a time where mad folks talk (shit) 
 Representin they crews or they East-West clicks 
 Let me tell everybody from coast to coast 
 About the lands we boast, but we don't own jack 
 How the (fuck) we movin through makin' moves like that? 
 How the (hell) we movin through makin' moves like that? 
 Can you explain that? I doubt that, very highly 
 We got jewels and Mo and the life is tight rowdy

 What really goes on? (James Brown: I don't know) 
 Q-Tip: 
 One is for the beat and the two is for the rhyme 
 Three is for the life, now we on this incline 
 Never catch this kid stickin forks in swine 
 Never ran my gibs in nothin' less than a dime 
 A few of my brothas did that asshole one time 
 Strivin miss sunrise, sometimes is known as crime 
 The three twenty-five got that Windex shine 
 And when I shot skelly, I had my boxes in lines 
 All I wanna do is live life and be fair 
 I used to stress girls with long legs and long hair 
 Now, I want a woman with a spiritual flair 
 God will never make it too hard for me to bare 
 I'm hungry like a derelict whose stays in the diluse 
 Some can count me out, but yo, I doubt that I lose 
 The Westernized world got our minds confused 
 You frontin on me, ak, then you don't get bruised 
 The funny style cats, they be playin' games like Chucky 
 Government officials shoot their same old... 
 Made of devil agents a. k. a. the devil flunky 
 Stiff (ass) squares gettin' mad 'cause we funky 
 This the crap game, then we got the top rolls 
 The positive jumps the negative like frogs 
 Resentin evil vibes, yo, that (shit) is at the morgue 
 We celebrate laughin' down in at the smorgas borg

 Q-Tip: 
 Power. People really get caught up with this 
 On different levels power controls your life 
 Money. The companion of the first. 
 Some people tend to worship and we know this ain't right. 
 Phife: 
 Attitude is how I get my point across. 
 You can't call yourself an MC if you know that you're soft. 
 Aggressive... is how the stage is approached. 
 I burn MCs like toast 'cause I'm the host with the most. 
 Consequence: 
 Illin (illin) is what you do when you're assin. 
 Whether it be you or all up in your past and... 
 Cashin... done turned your people corrupt 
 It's six o'clock, girl, you gotta get your weight up 
 Q-Tip: 
 Sex (sex). Either a man or a woman. 
 This agenda, but when lovers get down 
 Froggin. When niggaz try to play roles 
 But when they really need to put that shit background 
 Phife: 
 Miserable (miserable) is what your whole crew will be

 Heavenly... is how the track tends to flow 
 And if you don't know, tell 'em diggy said so

 Now, I'm packin dimes like Chilli 
 Stress (stress). That's what I always go through 
 'Cause it's survival of the fittest on the 192 
 Q-Tip: 
 Knowledge. When the mind accept facts 
 On this plane of livin', knowledge be the key, black 
 Understanding. Gettin' a grip on what's revealed 
 When shit be real, can't give understanding back

56,A Tribe Called Quest,hiphop,Stressed Out,"Intro./chorus 
 Faith Evans: 
 I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out 
 When you're face to face with your adversity 
 I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out 
 We're gonna make this work out eventually 
 Verse one 
 Q-Tip and Consequence: 
 Yo I ain't one to complain but there's things in the game 
 (And what's your name?) Consequence, I'm tight, burnt like flames 
 (Well why's that?) American dreams, they got the ghetto kid in a fiend 
 Q-Tip: 
 Don't stress that 'cause it's not in your bloodstream 
 Your whole being, comes from greatness, d'you remember? 
 Shatan got you caught in the storms of December 
 And brothers on the block packin' nines like September 
 Crazy situations keeps pockets on slender 
 Consequence: 
 Yo I be on the avenue where they be actin' brand new 
 I'm splurgin' on these Reebok joints for shorty boo 
 Q-Tip: 
 All of a sudden, I saw these two kids frontin' 
 Talkin' out they joints but they wasn't sayin' nothin' 
 My hand was on my toolie they was actin' unruly 
 (Say word) Yo word up, yo I was tight caught up 
 But I swallowed my pride and let that nonsense ride 
 Because I'm positive and seems that negative dies 
 Consequence: 
 Yo we was at the dice game makin' these cats look silly 
 Flamin', steady runnin' off at the Willie 
 Q-Tip: 
 I had my cash mixed, my rent due with my play-dough 
 I gotta see some loot so all my girls I blow 
 Shook them shits in my palm let 'em hit the flo' 
 Kept my eyeballs scopin' for them pigs po-po 
 I got to go on the ave see my parole by fo' 
 But I gotta steady freak these boys like Jojo 
 Consequence: 
 And I was doin' it, till I met Ike, Spike, and Mike 
 One roll, they had my pockets thirstier than Sprite 
 Q-Tip: 
 Yo, I know the feelin', when you feelin' like a villain 
 You be havin' good thoughts but the evils be revealin' 
 And the stresses of life can take you off the right path (No doubt) 
 Jealousy and envy tends to infiltrate your staff 
 We gotta hold it down so we can move on past 
 All adversities, so we can get through fast, like that 
 Verse two 
 Consequence: 
 You got the NWO (low cash flow) 
 Your baby's on the way (and you don't know who) 
 And cross-town niggas tryin' to (bust at you) 
 Aiyyo they got me stressed out (and you don't know what to do) 
 So frame this Kodak black, and vision to my contact 
 With a poultry scrap, workers get pistol smacked 
 The switch hittin Queens, niggaz liquid sword spittin' 
 With raw poppy, and now your first love is krill 
 Your vision of the mil got crept like Hey Lover 
 Tried to rise to the top, you just couldn't recover 
 And all I want is my laceration of the pie 
 To get this whip cream before the water runs dry 
 Niggaz flashdancin yo I don't know why 
 You're sick of snitchin, she got you cruisin to the pokey 
 Like Smokey, the stress be tryin' to squeeze out a homey 
 While I be tryin' to get star status like Shinobi 
 So we can build a dynasty, just like the Toby's 
 And all I want, is the world to know my steez 
 These money hungry niggaz is seven thirty 
 And got me stressed out like these frog MC's 
 Faith Evans:

 Dearly beloved, dearly departed

 Can you feel it when it hit right 
 Can you feel it when we do it 
 Truth, power, taste, devour 
 Niggaz in the street here comes the illest beat now 
 Move oceans wit' your mental 
 Think it, do it, be it, embellish 
 Here's another point for everyone to relish 
 When Ski busts his tools all y'all foes will embellish 
 For somethin' wicked at y'all faces 
 What I see is longin', needin' 
 Hey I got you with that goooooood stuff 
 And ya probably won't get enough 
 Ay-yo, lyrics I got it, lyrics, cadence 
 Do it with fun and patience 
 Funky, rhythmic, characteristic 
 Ebonically lingustic wit' the ghetto futuristic 
 Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay... 
 Beat me in the head, don't beat me in the head 
 Don't beat me in the head, don't beat me in the head 
 Don't beat me in the head, don't beat me in the head 
 Don't beat me in the head, head, head, head... 
 So here we are fam let's start,

58,A Tribe Called Quest,hiphop,Find A Way,"Now you caught my heart for the evening 
 Kissed my cheek, moved in you confused things 
 Should I just sit out or come harder 
 Help me find my way 
 Messin' me up, my whole head 
 Teasing me, just like Tisha did Martin 
 Now look, at what you starting 
 School boy crush, and it ain't on the hush 
 The whole world, see it, but you can't 
 My people's they complain, sittin' rave and rant 
 Your name is out my mouth like a ancient chant 
 Got me like a dog as I pause and pant 
 Speaking of which, got a leash and a wish, just to rock you miss 
 Make a militant move, peep my strategy 
 End of the day you're not mad at me 
 Not dealing with nobody now, that's what you told me 
 I said hey yo it's cool, we could just be friendly 
 Cause yo, picture me messin it up 
 Her mind I corrupt with the ill C-cups 
 Shiiit, I'm on my day off 
 Bullshittin, hopin' that the day go slow 
 Got me like a friend, what confuses me though 
 It's kisses when we breeze, tell me what the deal yo 
 Now why you wanna go and do that love huh 
 Making things for me towards you harder 
 Killing me, just when I think we there 
 You doubts the whole vibe and it floats in the air 
 Tellin' me, bout next man 
 But next man ain't the nigga wit the plans 
 Who, got your heart in mind 
 It's about time that you just unwind 
 And let it just happen, make it front-free 
 Just sweat me like money paney 
 Diggin' you, gettin' inside of your stee' 
 It's the quest cat, keepin' you company 
 Forever or however you want it 
 Word word 
 Now wait a minute ma, before you dead into the curb 
 Try to make impressions which is good, not the herb 
 But it, it it ain't me, and I, I ain't blurred 
 I'ma still just chill wit you 
 Maybe this'll change if you change your view 
 If not, then I guess it is cool 
 Just, keep to yourself and abide by the rules 
 Shake it out now (repeats)

 Flippin' on brothers just like Mary Lou Retton 
 Get off that ass and see what I'm settin' 
 Born with this inside, you just can't get it 
 This is the lethal pop and you have no weapon 
 Who is the native brother who keep asses steppin' 
 Make deep impressions and constantly be reppin' 
 (Phife) 
 When I was young I'd stretch gouch yo 
 Now I'm on Letterman, on the couch yo 
 The black thing with knives is called the back do' 
 Can't we be cool instead of being foul though 
 Ghetto child dreams of fast cars and fast dollars 
 Impressions of live sometimes makes ya holler 
 Scream all that devil shit and talk like a scholar 
 You dumb as a doorknob, and why do you bother

 Phife Dawg puttin' the bite back in yours 
 Top dog, puttin' it up, flick his balls

 Zombies, do it from dusk to the light

 Rock to the beat, yo it's never the same 
 Good girls usually got good game 
 Hot cats tearin' that ass out the frills 
 Block ass, you had no skills, that's the reals

 Take this honey, there goes your diction 
 Rappers better retreat, fix your joints 
 My whole crew got bumps on they points 
 (Phife) 
 Rumors being spread 'bout me and my click 
 We can't rock shows and our rhymes ain't shhh 
 Might not've heard it, or maybe you have 
 Between me and you, they can kiss my ass 
 Used to get angry, used to get quite vexed 
 But say what you may, just cash my check

 Doing shows galore, and bringin' it raw"

 She attended UMASS and she passed every class 
 Walked down the hall with her stuffed up sass 
 Told the basketball players, she liked how they pass 
 But when I use to hit it, the ball cat, she quit it 
 She wouldn't ad-mit it, but shorty was addicted 
 (Say Word) Word, Nigga you heard 
 Like a fiend with a queen when he catches the bird 
 (Q-Tip) 
 Knowing how we living I'ma talk about Mayo 
 ?Sagartery and mommy? Her love was a KO 
 We was on the under, had to stay on the lay low 
 Use to go so deep, she had to say Aiyyo 
 Rock with her friend, but her friend drove both way 
 Asked her about it and she used to say No way 
 Just let it go yo, I used to say OK 
 Just another day but fight anyway 
 (Q-Tip) 
 I put it down man, whatcha gonna do 
 (Phife) 
 Well hell, I put it down son, whatcha gonna do 
 (Together) 
 We put it down for the area crew 
 All the shortys that smoking y'all whoo 
 Looking good it you sipping on your brew 
 Come here ma, we make it hot for you 
 Come here ma, we make it hot for you 
 Come here ma, we make it hot for you 
 (Phife) 
 Met a shorty named Kenny from East Saint Louie 
 Body good and plenty, the finest in Missouri 
 If you had no money, you better hit the highway 
 Even in her own right, she had to do it her way 
 (Q-Tip) 
 It was an ill situation when I met Dantanya 
 Worked in Saint Louis in her mother's hair parlor 
 Use to hit her man for cake to come see me 
 Her and her man from home, they sold heemey 
 We had it hemmed, locked, sold and shit 
 When I thugged it yo, she said I was the ultimate 
 Broke her up kid, driving the drill like Truck Turner 
 All of things they did not concern her 
 People that we love yo, we love for a passion 
 I'm the type of cat that brings forth the action 
 You feeling me yo? I hope you hearing me yo 
 One more thing before you start cheering me yo 
 (Q-Tip) 
 I put it down Phife, what we gonna do 
 (Phife) 
 Well hell, I put it down son, whatcha gonna do 
 (Together) 
 We put it down for the area crew 
 All the shortys that smoking y'all whoo 
 You're Looking good it you sipping on your brew 
 Come here ma, we make it hot for you (repeat till end)"
68,A Tribe Called Quest,hiphop,Against The World,"(Intro: Phife and Tip) 
 Back at you, 
 Right back at you, 
 (Verse 1: Tip and Phife) 
 Drove around the block, drove a lot, 
 Lookin' all around, don't see no cops, 
 Whispered in your ear, a ghetto star, 
 Sittin' on my lap inside of my car, 
 Lookin' at my lips, take a taste, 
 Taste yours too, rub your back, 
 Run your fingers on the logo of my baseball hat, 
 Moonlight dancin' inside of your eyes, 
 Close your legs, I start to sigh, 
 Now I reach down to unlace my Nikes, 
 Kick off your Adidas 'cause that's what you like, 
 Chris Tucker joke passed inside of my head, 
 Put the thought away think of you instead, 
 Hot outside, it's hot in here, 
 Roll down the window the breeze in your hair, 
 Your earrings shake, you a baby doll, 
 You say you want me but did you want them all?? 
 Make me feel special, I know that you can, 
 Make me feel special like a prominent man, 
 Prominent, dominant McCoy and I'm real, 
 Another brotha's fan? Forget how he feel 
 Chorus: Tip and Phife 
 Me and you girl go against the world, 
 Against the world?, 
 (Female voice) Hell yeah the world 
 (Female voice) 
 Yeah the world, 
 Yeah the world, 
 Yeah the world, 
 Whole wide world, 
 Yeah the world, 
 Yeah the world, 
 Yeah the world, 
 Whole wide world, 
 Yeah the world, 
 Yeah the world 
 Verse 2: Tip and Phife 
 Zonin' undress ya? ??Still hold play??? 
 Or can you hold my hand, it's better that way, 
 If we was on video I'd press rewind, 
 A nigga think about you all the time, 
 Pidgeon dropped a note on top my head, 
 R&B, pop girl's a thoroughbred, 
 Run around the track, let me slow you 
 Dowwwwnnnnnn... 
 Pick you up, 
 Raise your cups, let's double up, 
 Bomb came known, natural disas, 
 Fall in love with me? huh, well that's that ass, 
 Wanna get you, inside my world, 
 Process, straight, afro or curl, 
 Stretch me out, fades me in, 
 Forever you in need let me see you grin? 
 He fucked you, I'm a tap his chin?? 
 Make me feel special, I know that you can, 
 Make me feel special like a prominent man, 
 Prominent, dominant McCoy and I'm real, 
 Another brotha's fan? Forget how he feel!"

 And we do our thing for the one nine two 
 And the rest of the country 'cause we from there too 
 Makin' sure love is givin' when I get it from you 
 Everybody, we regulate the party and shit 
 Love it when I get a little rugged wit' it 
 Love the circumstance to make my dough flow right 
 Love rockin' mics plus the ill style nights 
 She does it real good but love'll make it mo' better 
 Got me kind of open in the DK sweater 
 Love when my peoples come home from jail bids 
 Really love women and I really love kids 
 Love tight gloves where the music just bang 
 Camp-ass with gas women or shorty got bangs 
 Lovin' it Yo yo, I'm lovin' it 
 Love a women when she got a tight outfit 
 Outfit meaning outlook and disposition 
 You love it when a nigga cause a love composition 
 Love peanut butter and jelly on wheat 
 Wylin' out, makin' hot shit to hot beats 
 From Ohio to Poughkeepsie 
 From Phoenix to NC 
 From Cali to DC 
 Love it when the pressure falls righ on me 
 Love it when God keeps on overlookin' 
 Do a tight show so promoters keep bookin' 
 We do it all for the love y'all

 From the heart inside of the heart y'all

 All my peoples in the ghettos, for the love y'all 
 All my peoples all around, for the love y'all for the love love 
 For my crews bomb, where my peoples still at 
 If they call me and I don't call back 
 For weeks at a time, love is still intact 
 Let's be big about it, and realize the fact 
 Love it, when the underdog comes through 
 Ghetto revalizer, overthrow these rules 
 Love it, when I get spared another day 
 Used to drink zay while my niggas weighed yay 
 Love it, when I gain control over this 
 Life is really bigger than the rolly on my wrist 
 Got a twist to this shit and the answer's inside 
 Sho as the world's small and the Mississippi's wide 
 Had to rock a vest over unchoosed fest 
 Now I see people rockin' theirs in jets 
 Love it when my loved one really hold me down 
 Brand new flight and I'm takin' off ground 
 We do it all for the love y'all 
 Check it out, we do it all for the love y'all 
 For the love, for the love, for the love y'all 
 We get the paper but it's still for the love y'all

 We want y'all all to know, that it's time... 
 CHORUS (all): 
 Rock rock y'all 
 Freak freak y'all 
 To the beat y'all 
 It's unique y'all (2x) 
 (Punch) 
 A-yo praise the master, make plans wit' your pastor 
 My rap'll blast ya, send you to the hereafter 
 I push a tractor, for horses grazin' in the pasture 
 Ya heard I was trickin', the whole room filled with laughter 
 In ciphers, I'm the one you don't rhyme after 
 You only know half of the math, it don't add up 
 The lead batter, my hits make ya frame shatter 
 Watch me now! Just begun like Jimmy Castor 
 I'm bad luck just like walkin' under ladders 
 Mad rappers, book of life, last chapter 
 Me and my squad build just like contractors 
 I break shit, you only give hairline fractures 
 Women flash us, don't know ya better ask us 
 A bastard, wit' more contacts than Lens Crafters 
 Tear down the rafters, venerials couldn't clap us 
 You need practice, hit chicks then I'm Casper 
 (Jane Doe) 
 The church of scientology, feminine biology 
 Manic depressive psychologically, A.D.D. alive and we 
 Polluted by technology, the fumes and its ecology 
 While your thought you was out of copy I get nastier than sodomy 
 Probably an oddesey, started back on robbery 
 Was the degree of the economy that do the sovereignty 
 Regarded as a prodigy, leery in sociology 
 Let the wallabees always conceal my gynecology 
 Rhymin' pathologically, that's how it gotta be! 
 Never makin' no apology, worshippin' my anthropology 
 Fuck modesty, studyin' microbiology 
 Causin' verbal lobotomy, it's in my genealogy 
 Six months of sobriety, movin' very methodically 
 Like a unicorn, more ways than oceanography 
 Guard technology, rip shows antibiotically 
 True thugs bionically, give birth to criminology 
 (Words) 
 Yo as a youngin', I swear to God you couldn't tell me nothin' 
 I swore I was gettin' somethin', clothes or humpin' 
 For girls with the church, slacks with some shirts tucked in 
 I set it up for money, my mom worked when I was cuttin' 
 Unsigned strugglin', for the heat I lit the oven 
 One would by the CD, the other would do the dubbin' 
 Before I met Rob, I was in the clubs frontin' 
 Oh yeah I know the Tip, when I see him I be duckin' 
 But now when I'm clubbin', those that used to dis were buggin' 
 Overweight chicks, spandex, they stomachs sucked in 
 Stay interruptin', dance and try to cut in 
 Told people you got in free when you really snuck in 
 (Q-Tip) 
 We never get concerned about who's in the league 
 We just stay workin' so no one will need 
 An unconcerned outsider givin' niggaz feed 
 My niggaz puff weed but negotiate the seed 
 The family is granite and you can't intercede 
 I try to switch lanes at this operatin' speed 
 Cats in the game be gamblin' with greed 
 We the house, you the player and we gonna catch these 
 Who's the Sam Sneed makin' microphones bleed 
 Poker face creed while my mind just read 
 Shorty got rhythm but her freak got freed 
 That's insignificant but this take heed 
 (Mos Def) 
 They say I'm pretty like Clay is, bright like the day is 
 Beats from my fleet be sweet like Sugar Ray is 
 I'm swingin' this from Bay Ridge to where the Oakland Bay is 
 My game is tough to play, I'm tough to weigh like your safe is 
 The aim is, to make you recognize what the name is 
 Mos Def gon' set it straight from where the 718 is 
 The place with the great superiginate the flavors 
 An all-star block with some all-star laymans 
 (Turn the music down!) This is probably some haters 
 Achin' 'cause they hear us rotatin' on the playlist 
 From B-boy laces to Detroit gators 
 Yo Tip I got to bail, where the scale? Help me weigh this... 
 Yo! We wan't y'all to know... that this is the family, right? 
 And what we want everybody out there to do... on the dance floor... 
 Is get ready... because noooowwwwww we gonna...

 Here in 1992, we present... 
 The fabulous what's the Scenario remix 
 Whereas there are seven MC's 
 Six which are in physical form, one which is in spiritual essence 
 And he goes by the name of, uh... HOOD! 
 (Hood) 
 Check the vibe, walk that ass or get got 
 Eff it (shiiit!) I lick buckshots 
 Hood, madman, I rip up stages 
 Lay down all your wages, I'm wild like Larry Davis 
 Extra, extra, pick up a clip 
 I'll tear ass out the frame (HA!) and grab my dick (Oh!) 
 I'm a Rock'Em Sock'Em robot kid, I drop bombs 
 I'm rugged and deadly, so I shit on the petty 
 I baseball bat a bastard, I'm bad news 
 I'm crazy and clever, cut those of crews 
 Death on the phono, my skills are polo 
 You say ""oh no"" you bitch ass homo 
 I bag up waste, electrifyin, I'm prime-time 
 I slaughter a slime, I'm the greatest of all time 
 Sick-ass brother, nasty-ass nigga 
 Pump slugs in your face, and dump that ass in the river 
 Two tears in a bucket, fuck it, kick the can 
 (SAY WHAT, SAY WHAT?!?!) I'm a baaad, baaad man! 
 (Phife Dawg) 
 Quick is how I flip from the tip of the lip 
 Punchin out hits like Gladys Knight and the Pips 
 The five-foot assassin has just raided your area 
 Your booty rhymes are wack and that's the reason I ain't hearin ya 
 (SO!) Roll out the red carpet 'cause I'm kickin this 
 Vanilla Ice platinum? That shit's ridiculous 
 Excuse my French, but profanity is all I knew 
 And to you other sellouts, oh yeah, eff you too 
 And let it be known, I'm not the one to step to 
 You're better off callin D-Nice ""To Your Rescue"" 
 Freestyle fanatic, probably the best around 
 As for corny MC's, like Chuck D, I ""Shut 'Em Down"" 
 The Artical Don of hip-hop and I won't stop 
 The five-foot assassin has come to wreck 'nuff shop 
 So do like Michael Jackson and ""Remember the Time"" (DO YOU REMEMBER?) 
 Put on your dancin shoes or somethin' cause ya sho' can't rhyme 
 (Cut Monitor Milo) 
 (BIG UP, BIG UP!) Into new identity 
 Next was said somethin' that complies onto me 
 What does it take to check a technique? 
 (Many styles, many styles!) 
 Hostile heat, brings forth the energy 
 Milo in the dance is the new identity 
 One-two mic check, select for the ruffneck 
 Set 10 to 1, bet, I come CORRECT! 
 In my cyphers on blocks, I bring box to connect with knots 
 So I can grow dreadlocks 
 Maintain to rock (DON'T STOP THE ROCK) 
 Maintain to rock (DON'T STOP THE ROCK) 
 Kick it right, then not, E. Watt said not 
 I put my mug up, but fair is fair 
 So C. Brown are we in the clear? (Yeah!) 
 C. Brown are we in the clear? (Yeah!)

 Makin' moves y'all (MOVES Y'ALL!) On and on and on 
 (CHECK IT, CHECK IT OUT!) To the break of, break of dawn 
 (WHO'S THAT?!) Guess, one of the L.O.N.S. 
 And a Tribe Called Quest (EAST COAST) to West 
 Remixed mad kick, more than Metallica 
 Till all MC's fall like the Battlestar Gallactica 
 Stampin, stompin, rompin Compton 
 (PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD) I'm promptin (STYLE!) 
 Pick a style, any style, Strong Isle 
 Representation, sensationalization 
 ""Scenario"" for the radio, 'BLS and KISS, so 
 (HERE WE GO, YO!) Yeah 
 Force, Main Source LP on the rise 
 ""In Living Color was"" seen through original eyes 
 And I'm out like shout, Ooh Ah, Ooh Ah 
 (Ooh Ah, Ooh Ah!) There it is baby pah 
 (Dinco) 
 Lying limp on a limb, slim trim, D I am 
 There I am (THERE I AM!) don't run from a friend 
 Sight we be right, be polite for the mice 
 Like a like (SEE SICK, SEE SYKE) 
 And slip away, and off to the Poconos 
 Spot picked the clothes, Hype swing the pretty pose 
 Yamaha (HEY HA MAY!) 
 Let's split the funk, now it all spells (HEY!) 
 Enough enough, Ms. Fitted I'm with it 
 If I did it, I was blitted, and probably shouldn't have quit it 
 Cause yo, my vocal status at Knight is like a Gladys 
 Bed rest, spread test, and yo I'm like the maddest 
 Male, not female, hail from Unidel 
 Bounce the b-ball cause beats are being yelled 
 In the hallways always ringing with a HO! 
 This one two times nine on the Scenario 
 (Q-Tip) 
 Check it out, everybody, grabs the mics 
 Black mens gettin' hip, DOIN' WHAT THEY LIKE! 
 Eight black brothers in the public eye 
 If you listen very close, I will tell you why 
 (HOOD!) Phife, Milo, Dinco and C. Brown 
 Shaheed, myself, and Busta Bust Down 
 Will commence to rock (ROCK!) so bring on the flocks (FLOCKS!) 
 In-terrogation for the knockin' of the box 
 The boom-box ruler, controls the medula 
 None come cooler, I win like Shula 
 So bust out the moves as you start to pursue her 
 Intensified mind, nine-blunt consumer 
 Tip will come booty (WELL IT'S ONLY A RUMOR!) 
 The meaning so deep that it starts brain tumors (TUMORS!) 
 Peace to Hood baby from the midnight crooner 
 Smoke 'em up later, if not then sooner 
 (Busta Rhymes) 
 Hey what we gon DOOO in ninety-TWO 
 Even though we had FUUUN in ninety-ONE 
 Wonderful my days, all things comin' down 
 Run up on the new sound, leavin' cracks in the ground 
 What's goin' on my man? (GOD DAMN!) 
 And now my brain is hurtin' 
 Listen up, Bust-up, straight gon' hit 'em then I get 'em 
 Rip on 'em, shit on 'em, hit on 'em, then I will sit on 'em 
 Open up your mouth if you want the food 
 To get rude, Flipmode, 'cause I'm in the mood 
 Ah-heh, ah-heh! Yeah man, that's how it goes 
 Body drippin with blood comin' out your nose 
 Give me a Band-Aid, what are you askin for? 
 (MORE!) Only your sacred and pure 
 Adverse, Zig-Zag, check it came to bust a new rep 
 Rap, Busta Rhymes, or bust this wicked rhyme 
 Yeah y'all in '92, 
 I'm packin my roach spray, ANYWAY! 
 Ding-A-Ling - Tribe Called Quest, Leaders of the New School 
 Mad brother when stealthy - RRRAAAOW RRAOW RRAOW!

 Live your life right when you be corrupt 
 Volcano about to erupt 
 Get it up, Get it up, Get it up 
 Got the motivating joints that keep your ass jumping 
 Why when a nigga get on, you want something 
 Yo I got the posinious traps for little rats that fiend 
 In come the bedroom dream 
 I kick it at a slow or at a quick tempo 
 A ladies' disposition won't fuck with the mental 
 I'm built for conflicts with chicks with issues 
 I can lick the wounds bring ease with miss yous 
 Bringin' all the pain and makin' things shiver 
 The beat make you bite your nails and shit your liver 
 And we gonna give a encore performance 
 Haters seem doormant while my presence is enormous 
 Tarnations, I went gold 
 Streesed out with Faith but told cats to get a hold 
 Who is the nigga who's mic is stronger 
 Rock for an hour and he might rock longer 
 Kid you're perplexed, seems I better get to gongin' 
 The clean up man, hang you up like on and 
 Don't step in the arena, that's a stern warning 
 I'm the pops, I raise the sun like morning 
 Seems you're still sleeping, hey, stop the yawning 
 Open up the blinds and witness the dawning 
 The new application and I'm the applier 
 And I'm a set it off like fire 
 Yeah yeah, that's where it's at 
 Make it hot and phat and like Puff (I like that) 
 Now I got to urge you on to move ahead 
 Don't dread, 'cause I keep the stock in the shed 
 And if you need a boost, then I got the jump 
 Because we prone to make the party go 
 Bump bump bump bump bump bump bump where you is, 
 If you the baby daddy then uplift the kids 
 Get back and plan, don't be on front flossin' 
 Incognito, you heard the name quite often 
 You dressed in black and been issued a coffin 
 I thrive on this plain, you off to the lost one 
 Like cayon pepper, it gets hot to the better 
 From each little dash it get the whole smash 
 It's tasty too, so satisfy your whole pallid 
 Fake ID's are revoked, they're invalid 
 Infractin' bodies out on the dance floor 
 Is what I wanna see, not less but much more 
 The lyrics just spewed, he got good reviews 
 The kid made the news, how he left no clues 
 On how he just murderlized the whole damn jam 
 He just got results that's smiles and waved hands 
 The mission could never be accomplished, however 
 Until we bounce to a autumn where hot weather 
 And still we'll be able to rock and rip crowds 
 While other emcees say nothin' and talk loud 
 While other emcees say nothin' and talk loud 
 If you with the Tribe, chest out and be proud 
 Shake your money maker 
 Shake your money maker 
 Shake your money maker 
 Shake it, shake it"

 Ayo who wanna pull on Phifer long time no hear from 
 Suckers walkin' around talking about they could get some 
 But that pop is non cypher, no can do 
 And if you think I'm a dope, then ask the other crew 
 And I proceed to let you know, exactly how to flow 
 I'm not Lawn Doctor so just step off with the hoe 
 Oops my mistake I didn't know you went with her 
 Should I run down the line of the all the kids that done hit her 
 Don't be bitter, I hear that honey resembles a critter 
 I heard she likes to do one-one my man John Ritter 
 But back to the subject you can't catch wreck 
 You must get respect, to earn respect 
 Suckers think they could herb me 'cause know I wear specks 
 You're full of jokes, but you your name ain't flex 
 I got the riches, the bitches, I'm large like a Huxtable 
 You think you're all that but you're girl's quite doable 
 Yeah, I'm tellin' you G, to back up off me 
 I'm not a mad cohort, but I'm not Mr. Softee 
 Rappin' is an art, coming straight from the heart 
 So forget the chart because the action can start 
 Q-Tip 
 Where ya at? To all my peoples with the funk 
 I'm the undercover brother dump your hoe in the trunk 
 Save all the sad songs and the tearjerkers 
 Niggaz step back it's the lyrical worker 
 The poems that I create ain't in paper back books 
 The poems that I create are for hookers and the crooks 
 My mental is excelling 'cause I dabble in the books 
 I'm not the one to front on, so suboops-suboops 
 Yo I gets the pickens, I'm such a damn Dickens 
 If you step to this then the plot just thickens 
 I'll run you around the track like a bunny and a dog 
 To me, your just another MC on the log 
 A link on the chain, fluid on the brain 
 I boast of hype lyrics, and yours are mundane 
 See I can't maintain, especially if you come back 
 I'm the lyrical master blaster, yeah I can do that 
 I can also do your girl, so leave the hoe at home 
 'Cause when I get done, I'll have her strung on bones 
 It's the no-joke pressure, that elevates my mind 
 Makes me pick up and go when it's time to drop my rhymes 
 My title is locked, the Abstract poetic 
 I'm in the idle mode but my energy's kinetic 
 So smooth and debonair, especially for the ear 
 Gotta keep my thing in gear 'cause it's evident and clear 
 That I will rock, rock, rock (fades away)"

75,A Tribe Called Quest,hiphop,One Two S**t,"Intro: Q-Tip, Phife Dawg, Busta Rhymes 
 One two, one two 
 One-wa-wa-one, one two one two (3X) 
 Yo it's the Q-Tip, you know I get down 
 Yes I rock to the rhythm of a funky sound

 One-wa-wa-one, one two one two (2X) 
 And it's the, Phife Dawg, and I do the same

 Aiyyo you know it's Busta Rhymes, ev-ery time 
 Oh yes, I'm comin' wicked with the new design 
 I'm sayin' 
 One-wa-wa-one, one two one two (2X) 
 Verse One: Q-Tip 
 MC's ain't coming equipped with the rhymes 
 Don't do the crime if you can't do the time 
 The time is eternal when you play with the miser 
 Soul is in my body, and the health make me wiser 
 The tantalizing wordplay yeah that's the joint 
 Sometimes I have to cuss just to prove my damn point 
 Brothers need to come, with better, compositions 
 I write and recite to make good position 
 In this, rap game here, we en-gineer 
 Stabbin up the jam yeah son shit's clear 
 And I be kickin rhymes in my own damn way 
 Beatin' niggaz to the punch like Sugar Ray 
 Got the cool-ass style, that's cooler than the cool 
 My lyrics is the bullet and the mic is the tool 
 Peace to C-Seventy-Three, and C-Seventy-Fo' 
 Do a little somethin' when I'm out on tour 
 Comin' through like narcotics for the antibiotics 
 Flappin shorty's stockings to the Space-like Sprockets 
 What you really need to do is just boogie your ass 
 It's not gassed, we got to make the good times last 
 Let the good times roll, 'cause we in control 
 Take you out on your high less you payin' a toll 
 Let the good times roll, let the good times toll 
 Take you out on your high less you payin' a toll 
 Verse Two: Phife Dawg 
 Question Why is that, MC's be wack 
 And major labels wanna sound like crap, Aiyyo Funk Dat! 
 Word to life I'm comin' rugged 
 'Cause once you add the hip to the hop kid, it equals out to love 
 If the beat's fat I use it, some wack shit, I lose it 
 Refuse it, how could you chose it, it stinks Renuse it 
 Put down the mic kid, 'cause you gets no dap 
 How long did it take for you to see you can't rap 
 The name is Phife Dawg, and I got nuff styles 
 It doesn't take long for me to get buckwild 
 So bust what I'm swingin' what I'm swingin' when I swing 
 I rap when I rap 'cause I never wanna sing 
 Go ask the last MC what happened when he said battle 
 I bust his ass in Cleveland now he's Sleepless in Seattle 
 Rude bwoy official comin' with the ill grammar 
 Comin' back on kids, like Joey Montana 
 We be the three MC's to make your mind go batty 
 Mad play, on WKRP in Cincinnati 
 So lord send a hon, if ya kyant send a han sen a man 
 An if ya kyan sen a man, come yaself 
 'Cause all deez bitin MC's, lawd dem somethin' else 
 See I kick the styles that'll make ya ass melt 
 Money on my mind so never mind a trick 
 New York is the town and the team is the Knicks 
 World's greatest five footer rippin parties apart 
 Here comes Shaheed with the big green shark 
 Never had to rhyme about feelin' what with lead 
 Never mind dat mon here come de dread 
 Verse Three: Busta Rhymes 
 We comin' farrrr farrrr farrrr 
 Busta Rhymes is comin' farrrr farrr farr 
 Ya know ya hear me Star! Bet your bottom dollah 
 Right after this jam about one million one two niggaz go follow 
 Whether it be today or tomorrow 
 Niggaz be collaboratin sickening you beat them like they father 
 Oh shit check out what I saying 
 Ah-hah ah-hah oh ah-hah ah-hah You know my niggaz don't be playing 
 Once upon a mah-hah-hacking time 
 I received the opportuni-ties to represent my first rhymes 
 To define, lyrical sensations 
 Black masons blowin' up the spot Just to represent the Nations 
 Three dimensions, tryclops, 
 Mr. Busta Rhymes three eyes 
 Fat like a burger and fries Mama-so-mama-saa-mamma-ma-ko-sah 
 Go back to the country to go check my grandmama 
 Eeeyah! Bring it to the table at the meetings 
 Gathering large receivings delivering intellectual ass beatings 
 As I carry on with my proceedings 
 Greetings! Watch a nigga debut on premier movie screenings 
 But before I be face to face 
 With my eternal resting place 
 I hope you find civilized every soul and every race 
 Sit dog sit! Busta Rhymes forever on that ultrasonic shit!"

 But not Hip-Hop yo, hahah 
 And let it be known... that we are on some umm... 
 Eh ah, uh, a-chicka-uh 
 Eh ah, uh, a-chicka-uh 
 And this ain't on the pop tip yo! 
 Are y'all kids tucked in? (Yeah!) 
 Here we go... 
 People in the audience, they cry out ""hoe"" 
 People with a gun, yo they'll cry out ""bo!"" 
 I don't like a cop, I don't sell a rock 
 But still the kanga's clock me, after a show 
 Standin on the stage and we're pourin with sweat 
 To people in the crowd I give what they get 
 Papers make paid, babies make laid 
 I don't really worry, nor do I fret 
 Waitin for the gimme and boy I got some 
 Sweat like a peach and tart like a plum 
 I thought what I think, I rock a bead-link 
 Legally I'll sip when I turn twenty-one 
 A letter to the homeboy that freaked the head dome 
 The army wants me to drop my microphone 
 Gotta be brief; no orders from a chief 
 Hot butter on what, say what, the popcorn 
 On the tour bus we hit the truck stop 
 A dollar for some chips, a quarter for some pop 
 We laugh and giggle some, Phife kiss the honeybuns 
 Ali Shaheed Muhammad keeps talkin' that shop 
 The brothers cruise on as we Quest, for the check 
 Callin up Famous to see, if it's there yet 
 Not a bourgeoise, hate the seminar 
 Ignorant flip, hey Miss you must jet 
 Flex for the funkiest, buts start to bounce 
 Measure Hip-Hop for weight, by the ounce 
 Bush on the tush, you're pullin while I push 
 Play me for the punk then puss, feel the pounce

 If the papes come yo yo I won't riff 
 I just sit down and get me a spliff 
 With mines I was born, a child of the corn 
 Molecules of the land they uplift 
 Levels is straight, in fact they're rectified 
 Adrenaline now is crazy multiplied 
 Four and four is eight, the fraction makes the plate 
 I make sure the Tribe is innnnnnnn... 
 With the quickness you bare the witness 
 Flexin and pumpin with the fitness 
 Movin it - UHH, doin' it - UHH 
 Those who oppose must hit the ??s-list?? 
 Doin' it and doin' it with the whole frame 
 Look what's in the mind and not in the brain 
 On this you can quote, we on a diffy note 
 Quest for the future, 'stead of the fame 
 One ninety-one brothers grabbin they thingies 
 Forgot the name; oh, equivalent to Jimmy 
 Slip a little bit, you think I have to quit 
 Ali Shaheed Muhammad, with the singy-singy 
 Slammin' with a slammy you front, on the case 
 Right or left nut Ali plays the ace 
 Do what you do, flam for a crew 
 Bonita Applebum blows smoke in Sha's face 
 Slang for the ?? I must, if ya have 
 Dribble hops out giggle yo proper term is laugh

77,A Tribe Called Quest,hiphop,I Left My Wallet In El Segundo (Vampire Mix),"Left my wallet in El Segundo 
 Left my wallet in El Segundo 
 Left my wallet in El Segundo 
 I gotta get it, I got-got ta get it 
 I left my wallet in El Segundo 
 Left my wallet in El Segundo 
 Left my wallet in El Segundo 
 I gotta get it, I got-got ta get it 
 My mother went away for a month-long trip 
 Her and some friends on an ocean-liner ship 
 She made a big mistake by leaving me home 
 I had to roam so I picked up the phone 
 Dialed Ali up to see what was going down 
 Told him I pick him up so we could drive around 
 Took the Dodge Dart, a '74 
 My mother left a yard but I needed one more 
 Shaheed had me covered with a hundred greenbacks 
 So we left Brooklyn and we made big tracks 
 Drove down the Belt, got on the Conduit 
 Came to a toll, we paid and went through it 
 Had no destination, we was on a quest 
 Ali laid in the back so he can get rest 
 Drove down the road for two days and a half 
 The sun had just risen on a dusty path 
 Just then a figure had caught my eye 
 A man with a sombrero who was four feet high 
 I pulled over to ask, were we was at 
 His index finger he tipped up his hat 
 ""El Segundo,"" he said, ""my name is Pedro 
 If you need directions, I'll tell you pronto"" 
 Needed civilization, some sort of reservation 
 He said a mile south, there's a fast food station 
 Thanks, senor, as I start up the motor 
 Ali said, ""Damn, Tip, what you drive so far for?"" 
 (Well describe to me what the wallet looks like) 
 Anyway a gas station we passed 
 We got gas and went on to get grub 
 It was a nice little pub in the middle of nowhere 
 Anywhere would have been better 
 I ordered enchiladas and I ate 'em 
 Ali had the fruit punch 
 When we finished we thought for ways to get back 
 I had a hunch 
 Ali said, ""Pay for lunch"", so I did it 
 Pulled out the wallet and I saw this wicked 
 Beautiful lady she was a waitress there 
 Put the wallet down and stared and stared 
 To put me back into reality, here's Shaheed: 
 ""Yo, Tip, man, you got what you need?"" 
 I checked for keys and started to step 
 But, what do you know, my wallet I forget 
 Yo, it was a brown wallet, it had props numbers 
 Had my jimmy hats I got to get it man 
 Lord, have mercy 
 The heat got hotter, Ali starts to curse me 
 I feel bad but he makes me feel badder 
 Chit-chit-chatter, car stars to scatter 
 Breaking on out, we was Northeast bound 
 Jettin' on down at the speed of sound 
 Three days coming and three more going 
 We get back and there was no slack 
 490 Madison, we're here, Sha 
 He said, ""All right, Tip, see you tomorrow"" 
 Thinking about the past week, the last week 
 Hands go in my pocket, I can't speak 
 Hopped in the car and torpe'ed to the shack 
 Of Shaheed, ""We gotta go back"" 
 When he said ""Why?"" I said, ""We gotta go 
 'Cause I left my wallet in El Segundo"" 
 Yeah, I left my wallet in El Segundo 
 Left my wallet in El Segundo 
 Left my wallet in El Segundo 
 I gotta get it, I got-got ta get it 
 Left my wallet in El Segundo 
 Left my wallet in El Segundo 
 Left my wallet in El Segundo 
 Come on, let's go... 
 Come on, let's go... 
 Come on, let's go..."
78,A Tribe Called Quest,hiphop,Pubic Enemy (Saturday Night Virus Discomix),"Q-Tip: 
 In the morning, woke up from sexual pleasures 
 Looked at her sexual partner 
 Who acquainted her acquaintance 
 Five hours ago at a disco 
 She went lower than low, into limbo 
 A thought crossed the mind, her, a bimbo 
 She answered no, so she had to go... 
 On with the program 
 Creedence, it seems that I've forgotten your name 
 But it seems that she's done the same 
 And now something has happened 
 Suddenly, she's been distracted 
 By something that has been attracted 
 She poked and poked and smacked at it 
 Then she broke down and she scratched it 
 Now, I think you understand 
 Clinic, saw the doctor flex his biceps 
 Then he picked up a pair of forceps 
 Her pretty face showed fright 
 Right then and there, she fainted 
 A really grim picture is painted 
 The brotha who she acquainted 
 Was the enemy, scary ain't it? 
 The Pubic Enemy 
 Q-Tip: 
 Old King Cole was a merry old soul 
 Had a lady queen, married since 18 
 He protested, that he was infested 
 Get lots of love and he couldn't digest it 
 All propaganda, one big fat lie 
 'Cause I see the king with my very own eye 
 Schemed and schemed like a crack fiend king 
 And poppin' up on the teammates scene 
 And poppin' and pimpin' hunnies with moneys 
 Whole situation to Tip, was kinda funny 
 He hold the crown but not the jimmy hat 
 Now he wears a frown and the jimmy hates that 
 So the fair maiden in the royal bedroom 
 Caught the king scratchin, so she had to assume 
 That he got vicked by the enemy's trick 
 The thought of cheatin' made the maiden so sick 
 That she screamed and screamed, went on and kept screamin 
 Threw a pot and his dome was beamin 
 You could hear him yellin' in the motherland 
 ""Baby, baby please. Baby, understand."" 
 She ignored and walked through the gate 
 The king is in the kingdom to await his fate... 
 Of the enemy: the Pubic Enemy 
 Q-Tip: 
 Everybody get sweaten, a deep is still a threaten 
 About the ??, that hate the ???, but still will be forgetten 
 About the ??? like the rocky picture horror 
 Don't move tracks, cause the pubic had the hour 
 You can get it from sleepin' in nasty dirty sheets and 
 Wearin' nasty cothes for all about the weekend 
 I suggest You do yourself a big favour 
 The ??? keep questin, I'ma damn ??? savior 
 Please remember this: a kiss is just a kiss 
 A hug is just a hug, but a bugging gets the bug 
 If You get the bug, oh boy, You'll be buggin' 
 ??? Home ??? started lovin' 
 Damn, after loving, just take it out 
 Don't get so far to Q, man 
 Inspect Yourself, trotect Yourself 
 Respect Yourself, then correct Yourself 
 Make sure, You don't get hand by the man"

 Before this did you really know what life was, 
 Comprehend to the track for its wide 'cause, 
 Gettin' mentions on the tip of the vibe buzz, 
 Rock 'n' roll to the beat of the funk fuzz, 
 Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug, 
 If you feel the urge to freak do the jitter bug, 
 Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug, 
 Afro-centric living is a big shrug, 
 A life filled with *horn* that's what I love, 
 A lower plateau is what we're above, 
 If you diss us we won't even think of, 
 Will nipper the doggy give a big shove, 
 This rhythm really fits like a snug glove, 
 Like a box of positives it's a plus love, 
 As the Tribe flies high like a dove...

 Bonita Applebum, remember way back woo 
 When you used to play your knickers and your pigtail do 
 I used to be all on it like a fly 
 Back in the days, Bonita was a hit 
 I flirted and I flirted till there was no end 
 But she kicked the diabolical and said we was friends 
 Honey, you was funny, but I'm tired of that 
 It's three years later, I got a new rap 
 Got a little older, a tidbit wiser 
 I gained twenty pounds, six inches higher 
 Speakin' of high, I saw you smoke the hootie mack 
 Your ex-boyfriend claims he gets the booty back 
 But I'm here to testify, it'll be a hard try 
 Slappin' my knees, lettin' out sighs 
 Wanna keep you slammin' like a hip hop song 
 Bonita Applebum, gotta put me on

 I'll never shed a tear, but then again I won't steer 
 You wrong, I'll steer you strong, for affection steer ya here 
 I'll take you to a place that's farther than the you know 
 What do you know, if we go to El Segundo 
 Your presence should be close, so like on ""Buddy"", I'll toast 
 To the ever-clever you, to say the least, you're the most 
 Honey, you're my honey, A-yo dip, you're my dip 
 Treasure and forever, velvet pleasure with Tip 
 As we glide and move, cushy like a pillow that's soft and smooth. 
 Ricky D said we got to show and prove. 
 Do it to the music that's the raw butt groove. Intimidate the boy, 
 Cupid, that's his name. Pickin' on us suckas 
 It's his flippin game, but Tip won't fall for that. 
 Instead, I'll get the Natives and we rush 
 To the latest lambskins store get a six pack of hats for...

 For non-conformists, one-hitter quitters

 Word to Phifer, gonna bring it to the overlord 
 Drinking Cisco, chilling with the gold microphone cords 
 And we grip our balls every time we stuntin' on tour 
 'Cause we never bore, responding to the ready crowd's roar 
 And promoters try to hit us with the art of war 
 We about our business, we not quitters 
 Not bullshitters, we deliver, we go get it 
 Don't be bitter 'cause we not just niggas 
 Jarobi, my fiber wove into different cloth 
 Ain't nothing forbidden, this nigga get his written off 
 Hardest spit in the city y'all niggas spitting kitten soft 
 Confused and amazed, shook up with your brain missing lost 
 They planning for our future, none of our people involved 
 Pouring Henny and Smirnoff to get it cracking off 
 Cracking off a Smirnoff to quickly turn to Molotov 
 Molotov the spaceship doors before that bitch is taking off 
 It always seems the poorest persons are people forsaken, dawg 
 No Washingtons, Jeffersons, Jacksons on the captain's log 
 They'd rather lead us to the grayest water poison deadly smog 
 Mass un-blackening, it's happening, you feel it y'all? 
 Rather see we in a three-by-three structure with many bars 
 Leave us where we are so they can play among the stars 
 They taking off to Mars, got the space vessels overflowing 
 What, you think they want us there? All us niggas not going 
 Reputation ain't glowing, reparations ain't flowing 
 If you find yourself stuck in a creek, you better start rowing 
 Used to see the TV screen as the place to land my dream in 
 And the car stereo where they would promote the show 
 Optimistic little brother with a hope you know 
 (Move on to the stars) There ain't a space program for niggas 
 Yeah, you stuck here, nigga 
 (Move on to the stars) There ain't a space program for niggas 
 Yeah, you stuck here nigga 
 (Move on to the stars) There ain't a space program for niggas 
 Yeah, you stuck here, nigga 
 (Move on to the stars) There ain't a space program for niggas 
 Yeah, you stuck, stuck, stuck 
 (Move on to the stars) 
 Sit and wonder sometimes, I read the paper every day 
 All these happenings is cycular, just happen different ways 
 And the president's refined, in her wing she's confined 
 With about thirty Percocets and five bottles of wine 
 Carolina, nothing finer than a Black woman who climbs 
 To the top of the State building claiming that that flag is mine 
 Now, people on top of people, feels like we can't breathe 
 Put so much in this mutha-fucka, feel like we shouldn't leave 
 Put it on TV, put it in movies, put it in our face 
 These notions and ideas and citizens live in space 
 I chuckle just like all of y'all, absurdity, after all 
 Takes money to get it running and money for trees to fall 
 Imagine for one second all the people are colored, please 
 Imagine for one second all the people in poverty 
 No matter the skin tone, culture or time zone 
 Think the ones who got it would even think to throw you a bone? 
 Moved you out your neighborhood, did they find you a home? 
 Nah cypher, probably no place to 
 Imagine if this shit was really talkin' about space, dude 
 Imagine if this shit was really talkin' about space, dude 
 Imagine if this shit was really talkin' about space, dude

 Are still here in the rear, ayo, we don't need you 
 You in the killing-off-good-young-nigga mood 
 When we get hungry we eat the same fucking food, the ramen noodle 
 Your simple voodoo is so maniacal, we're liable to pull a juju 
 The irony is that this bad bitch in my lap 
 She don't love me, she make money, she don't study that 
 She gon' give it to me, ain't gon' tell me run it back 
 She gon' take the brain to wetter plains, she spit on that 
 The doors have signs with, don't try to rhyme with 
 VH1 has a show that you can waste your time with 
 Guilty pleasures take the edge off reality 
 And for a salary I'd probably do that shit sporadically 
 The OG Gucci boots are smitten with iguanas 
 The IRS piranha see a nigga gettin' commas 
 Niggas in the hood living in a fishbowl 
 Gentrify here, now it's not a shit hole 
 Trendsetter, I know, my shit's cold 
 Ain't settling because I ain't so bold but ay 
 All you Black folks, you must go 
 All you Mexicans, you must go 
 And all you poor folks, you must go 
 Muslims and gays, boy, we hate your ways 
 So all you bad folks, you must go 
 The fog and the smog of news media that logs 
 False narratives of Gods that came up against the odds 
 We're not just nigga rappers with the bars 
 It's kismet that we're cosmic with the stars 
 You bastards overlooking street art 
 Better yet, street smarts but you keep us off the charts 
 So mother-fuck your numbers and your statisticians 
 Fuck y'all know about true competition? 
 That's like a AL pitcher on deck talking about he hittin' 
 The only one who's hitting are the ones that's currently spittin' 
 We got your missy smitten rubbing on her little kitten 
 Dreaming of a world that's equal for women with no division 
 Boy, I tell you that's vision 
 Like Tony Romo when he hitting Witten 
 The Tribe be the best in they division 
 Shaheed Muhammad cut it with precision 
 Who can come back years later, still hit the shot? 
 Still them tryna move we off the fucking block 
 Babylon, bloodclot 
 Two pon yuh headtop 
 All you Black folks, you must go 
 All you Mexicans, you must go 
 And all you poor folks, you must go 
 Muslims and gays, boy, we hate your ways 
 So all you bad folks, you must go"
83,A Tribe Called Quest,hiphop,Whateva Will Be,"Girl, this motherfucker's got rhythm 
 Say am I 'posed to be dead or doin' life in prison? 
 Just another dummy caught up in the system 
 Unruly hooligan who belongs in Spofford 
 Verse getting that degree at Stanford or Harvard 
 Threatened by my work ethic, the way I speak, yo 
 Should I be mentally weak, verse being Malik? Yo 
 Should I be trapped in the trap? Would you prefer that? 
 Fourth grade reading level but he knows how to rap 
 Are you amused by our struggles? The English that's broken? 
 The weed that I'm smokin'? The guns that I'm totin'? 
 The drugs that I'm sellin'? No need for improvement 
 Fuck you and who you think I should be, forward movement 
 Melanated shrouded in complexity 
 Brain charge shocking like 'lectricity 
 Mouth translate happens organically 
 The media relates it what it thinks it sees 
 Judging steps in shoes of a path they never walked 
 Shot down in a blaze of a phrases is how they talk 
 Dark skinned, walk with a bot portrayed villain 
 I'm chillin', felon down to the DNA crime willin' 
 Subliminate their youth, hyper-sexualize their women 
 They ain't got the strong enough hold, so they built the prisons 
 Pumping false religions to all of these niggas' systems 
 Every voice devoid of the truth, come on, listen 
 Man look at this, man look at this 
 Whatever will be will be 
 Like a billionaire investin' in a nigga's dreams 
 Certainly a head scratcher, like Pac and Big's killers' capture 
 Or a women with the wisdom who's leadin' the way 
 The rarity is in the rear, but never today 
 Man, picture a PD lettin' good records play 
 On the strength of what it is, not the finesse of your biz 
 And your lady calls you dirty, her dirts under rugs 
 You'll find out only if she tells you, take her kiss and hug, 'cause 
 In the answer for cancer in a prodigious kid's mind 
 Yes, the government will fund, learning is free for everyone 
 And from that lie, young leaders will rise in the eyes of despair and adversity 
 In some universe, this verse will be true 
 Everybody runnin' when they see the storm's comin' 
 But whatever's gonna be will be 
 Everybody runnin' when they see the storm's comin' 
 But whatever's gonna be will be 
 Some will dash to the mountain, some will crawl 
 And the weakest amongst them, they will fall 
 But the strongest in faith, they will stand tall 
 Everybody runnin' when they see the storm's comin' 
 But whatever's gonna be will be 
 I just wanna feel as liberated as lions in Liberia 
 'Cause recently my heart turned cold as Siberia 
 'Cause everywhere I go, bein' cold is the criteria 
 Let's see how well you know all your Tribe trivia

 If life's a obstacle then I'mma bike through it 
 I see it like a kiddie on the carousel 
 If I 'url while I go around, what the hell 
 And that went well, so I'm compelled 
 To have visions of getting chicken while my friends get jel 
 My young nigga motto was, ""Fuck it, I'm already grown"" 
 And I dream of when I'm sixteen, I'm out my home

 And girls scout thin mints, pardon my penmanship, but oh shit 
 Feel like I'm hungry now again 
 And I can't do nothing about it because my teeth are all rotted 
 And my mom and my pop, they just grin 
 And empathize with me 'cause they were little like Pygmies 
 But too bad they can't get back they 'member whens 
 Them grown-up stories don't work 
 In the court of the kiddies', the judgement is in 
 And while y'all doing all y'all your bids, y'all reminisce as kids 
 Fuck it, kids, the grown-ups won't own up 
 They stood on the corner, like you once upon a, time 
 And probably felt like a loner 
 And smelled like a stoner, and snuck to Daytona 
 So when they questioning you 'bout who or who you ain't boning 
 Complaining that you always moaning, never saying good morning 
 Storming out my house and slamming doors like you paying bills 
 They been through it too, though, they were kids like you, though 
 But what if they knew though and hit you with the cheat code 
 To a game you just start playing, no extra man 
 Leave you reckless on the court with no high percentage shot 
 Just a bunch of, ""You got 'em, nigga, just give it what you got"" 
 Yeah, it look a little different on a yacht but ain't gon' lie, I miss kayaking 
 I love the young niggas, and they do too, they just be acting 
 Like a bunch of retired tired thespians, a bit too salty

 They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya 
 They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya 
 They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya 
 They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya 
 They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya 
 They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya

 The old lady saw us on the lawn with the Henny 
 Turn the pool party into the one from McKinney 
 Might've been racist like the waitresses up in Denny's 
 Swore we had twelve gauges, automatics, and semis 
 Now they wanna condemn me for my freedom of speech 
 'Cause I see things in black and white like Lisa and Screech 
 Presidents get impeached and others fill in the throne 
 But veterans don't get the benefit of feelin' at home 
 So maybe those projections out at Silicon 
 Are what drove her to get injections made of silicone 
 I swear it's the killing season 
 'Cause killin' is still in season, yeah 
 Louder than a three pound, voices screaming mad to boot 
 It must be killing season, on the menu, strange fruit 
 Whose juices fill the progress of this here very nation 
 Whose states has grown bitter through justice expiration 
 These fruitful trees are rooted in bloody soil and torment 
 Things haven't really changed or they're dormant for the moment 
 Marks and scars, we own it, only made for tougher skin 
 Helps us actualize the actual greatness held within 
 Been on the wrong team so much, can't recognize a win 
 Seems like my only crime is having melanin 
 Connection to the sun so strong the relationship is lusted for 
 Causes men to suffocate, I can't breathe no more 
 Settle the score sadly, need an abacus to tally 
 Through all the peaks and valleys, yo, I recognize it sadly 
 Black soul bold enough, inner city cold enough 
 Watch me get all my goons, watch us get soldiered up 
 They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya 
 They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya 
 They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya 
 They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya 
 They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya 
 They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya 
 They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya 
 They sold ya, sold ya, sold ya"
92,A Tribe Called Quest,hiphop,Lost Somebody,"Yeah, Phife 
 For your life 
 Now, in the time when niggas wasn't supposed to be born 
 Best of us are left for dead in cities that looks war-torn 
 Vietnam going wrong, heroin going strong 
 Neighbors would whoop that bad ass just for running through their lawn 
 Walt met Cheryl, Cheryl met Walt 
 Trinidadian love sprouting through the asphalt 
 Love was consummated and the angels registrated 
 Two were to be born but only one of 'em made it 
 Inside a cloud of sorrow, a silver lining and joy 
 It's a bouncing baby boy, a king's name they would employ 
 And before he even squeaks, it's decided it's Malik 
 Now give him hope, give him care, raise him while his grandma there 
 Watch out momma, if you stare, light brown eyes'll keep you there 
 Let's progress the story just a little bit 
 Malik, I would treat you like little brother, that would give you fits 
 Sometimes overbearing, though I thought it was for your benefit 
 Despite all the spats and shits, cinematically documented 
 The one thing I appreciate, you and I, we never pretended 
 Rhymes, we would write it out, hard times: fight it out 
 Gave grace, face to face, made it right and now you riding 
 Out, out, out, out, damn 
 Have you ever 
 Loved somebody? (Phife dawg, man) 
 Way before you (Bow wow, woof woof) 
 Got to dream? 
 No more crying 
 He's in sunshine 
 Never thought that I would be ever writing this song 
 Hold friends tight, never know when those people are gone 
 So, so beautiful, opined indisputable 
 Heart of a largest lion trapped inside the little dude 
 Took me quick to granny house, now we eat the curry food 
 Talking hopes, dreams, plans, leak ice, never scared 
 Brand new pair of Nike Airs, avenue of Sayres 
 Mailbox mayors, all our rhymes was written there 
 A nigga wanna battle, you know Phifey didn't care 
 Jarobi with the beat, into new ass we tear 
 I'mma flash forward well, took a trip to ATL 
 Cooking in the kitchen, making sure my nigga eating well 
 Wedding in Tobago, you know exactly where I'm at 
 Standing on the side of black Malik Izaak 
 Have you ever 
 Loved somebody? 
 Way before you 
 Got to dream? 
 No more crying 
 He's in sunshine 
 He's alright now 
 See his wings 
 Have you ever 
 Loved somebody? 
 Way before you 
 Got to dream? 
 No more crying 
 He's in sunshine 
 He's alright now 
 See his wings 
 Have you ever 
 Loved somebody? 
 Way before you 
 Got to dream? 
 No more crying 
 He's in sunshine 
 He's alright now 
 See his wings 
 Have you ever 
 Loved somebody? 
 Way before you 
 Got to dream? 
 No more crying 
 He's in sunshine 
 He's alright now 
 See his wings 
 Have you ever 
 Loved somebody? 
 Way before you 
 Got to dream? 
 No more cry 
 No more cry"
93,A Tribe Called Quest,hiphop,Movin Backwards,"I hope my legendary style of rap lives on 
 A-fixed to the Earth like my feet, they got cleats on 
 I'm moving backwards never, that was never the plan 
 Pushing shit along, render stillness in the quick sand 
 Asphalt jumpin', lyrical, concrete 
 My Jedi mind be moving me throughout the many dark streets 
 Backwoods, boondocks, whatever terrain 
 Auf Wiedersehen, aloha, man, our feet ain't the same 
 I won't abuse these shoes, these shoes ain't made for reversing 
 Then trudging through these motherfuckers' first album Footprinting 
 Never ever ghostwritten, yo' shit free, bitten 
 Grab my shit with both hands, iron grip, steel mitten 
 Bloviated, Jarobi ate it and now it's gone 
 Closed mouths don't get fed or move ahead 
 To my hustlers with customers, scam my chicks just being petty 
 Trap lords with the fetty, don't be no backwards, no 
 No backward ass nigga, don't be no backwards, no 
 No backward ass nigga, don't be no backwards, no 
 Don't do it, nigga 
 I spun around without a care 
 When I stopped, I felt lost 
 I'm two heels from the top tier 
 Really want to be boss 
 I figured it out, figured it out somewhere 
 Maybe the answer's not out there 
 Maybe it's on the ground somewhere 
 When I stopped, I felt lost 
 Do you ever feel lost? 
 They wanna see my downfall 
 Turn a good day into a downpour 
 Thorns in the crown hit the cross I bear 
 Why they wanna see me hangin' like a towel somewhere 
 One eye, two bills, three tears, a heart still 
 How I'm feelin' in my mind right here 
 Think I'm moving, I ain't going nowhere, nowhere 
 Maybe why I feel lost, yeah 
 How I'm 'posed to know how home feels? 
 I ain't even on my home field 
 And again I feel lost 
 Was not a cruise that brought us here, again I feel lost 
 And I refuse to be stuck right here, yeah 
 I don't want to move backwards, no 
 Somebody just give me 
 Somebody just give me 
 Somebody just give me direction? 
 I don't want to move backwards, no 
 Somebody just give me 
 Somebody just give me 
 Somebody just give me directions? 
 I don't want to move backwards, no 
 Moving backwards never, that was never the plan 
 Can I vent? I was content being my own man 
 Up until that night ill-fated, walking home I was faded 
 Po puts braces on my wrist like he was clapping his hands 
 How demeaning, y'all? Who could be blind to racism? 
 Bring bro bro to me for the brotherly baptism 
 Instead of slaps, give him the dose of Ab wisdom 
 He'll make it out of the jungle some way 
 Hey, it's figurative, not a real place you stay 
 Ay, it's mind state filled with muck and malaise 
 Uh, I got direction without using Waze 
 Submitting myself to praying these days 
 Yeah, moonwalking backwards, it's only for stage 
 Feds lining up, we're right here and everybody's hands in the air 
 Four-five so get your ass found somewhere 
 Caught between hope and despair 
 Say it loud, what it take to make my niggas listen 
 Somebody just give me 
 Somebody just give me 
 Somebody just give me 
 Cool out, chill out nigga, I'm cool 
 Cool out nigga, nah, nigga I'm through 
 Head down, ain't no tellin' what you gon' do 
 Somebody just give me 
 Somebody just give me 
 Somebody just give me direction 
 I don't want to move backwards, no 
 Cops killing us niggas everywhere 
 Maybe we should get some guns too 
 She come around every now and a few 
 Man, I hope she really loves you 
 Living high ain't hard to do 
 She'll be in the clouds somewhere 
 Feeling fresh, I strut your bitches out of here 
 Might even take your broad too 
 Oops, I'm 'bout to get kicked out here 
 Tell mama I'mma slide through 
 Stealer, I'm trying to get out of here 
 But stuck up in the same room 
 Too many open miles in here 
 Sick of eating out at drive through 
 Hahaha, look at this motherfucker"

 Trump and the SNL hilarity 
 Troublesome times kid, no times for comedy 
 Blood clot, you doing, bullshit you spewing 
 As if this country ain't already ruined 
 In lieu of these mumbling, fumbling, swearing they're the greatest 
 Online they debate us, if we different, then we're haters 
 We ended our hiatus, the dogs looking for food 
 The nucleus is here now (ooh) 
 Toleration for devastation, got a hunger for sin 
 Every nation Obama nation, let the coroner in 
 Crooked faces, red and blue laces for the color of men 
 Just embrace it and die alone, song of Revelation

 Ego, ego (skippin', trippin' in my mind) 
 Ego, ego (trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin') 
 Ego, ego 
 I got one, you got one, and now we equal 
 Sometimes it makes you trip out on your people 
 Sometimes it has connotations of evil 
 Sometimes niggas call on it when they need to 
 It's called the ego 
 Ay, it's hard to really make the subject positively stated 
 Some may hate it and some may overrate it 
 It's a top story and you rarely see a trend 
 So all you psychoanalysts, pull out your pad and pen 
 It's called the ego 
 Come up with an idea, and no one seems to get it 
 Then every time you mention it, they stare like you're two-headed 
 But one day, in your cubicle, your idea really comes to view 
 Your boss is walking by, he sees it too and he takes it from you 
 She put you on the aces of all the stripper places 
 And has the kinda clientele where niggas trick off very well 
 You beg her and you plead her and you tuck away your ego 
 She knows you need the chicken and you know that she's your people 
 They call you fat and lazy, your commentary crazy 
 They photoshop your face on a box of McCormick gravy 
 And now that inner voice, that ego, making you get wavy 
 Change your diet, hit the gym and say, ""What were you saying to me?"" 
 The ego makes you do it, it makes you face the music 
 Or run away from life so fast that you'll outsprint Carl Lewis 
 It has you think your deceptive ways of being are the truest 
 Had the prettiest brown eyes but you change them shits to the bluest 
 It's the ego 
 Ooh, Jack White 
 Ooh, Jack White 
 A celebrated genius, my dick game is the meanest 
 I'll take the girl that's augmented, new me is invented 
 I'll take the biggest house in Calabassas 
 Anyone for Michael Phelps swimming classes? 
 You need it when you're balling, equally when you're falling 
 Or when those kids in school, on your locker they get to scrawling 
 Epithets that's racist is stupid and mean in nature 
 Something that can make you feel stronger when people hate ya 
 Ego make you violent or govern like a tyrant 
 Or switch a dictionary's word from vibrant to vivrant 
 Fool the thirsty people, selling tap water in bottles 
 Fooled a girl with NYU scholarship and now she models 
 Ego has no ending, has people pretending 
 Religious zealots get jealous 'cause guys want their defending 
 This is the last Tribe and our ego hopes that you felt us 
 And closing for our ego, we know only God can help us 
 Ego, ego (skippin', trippin' in my mind) 
 Ego, ego (skippin', trippin' in my mind)

 The best buddy's in evening wear 
 Long lovin' less Tru know (he's in there)

 Fly buddy told us all to get into a circle 
 Said don't worry 'cause I won't hurt you 
 All I really want to do is freak you (she freaked us)

 When I'm in motion it's just like the flow of the ocean

 My style flexes bigger than the state of Texas 
 Quick as a Lamborghini, smooth as a Lexus

 Oh yes I'm the most prime of all time

 On with the rapture, so that I can capture 
 Your mind with state of the art music made to adap to 
 To knowledge the God on the groove

 Or wobble, your rhymes is mixed up like boggle 
 Bingo! that was the damn dog's name 
 But yo I know another one with much more fame 
 The phife dawg, and that's my word to the cipher 
 About to bring it to your chest and cause strife check it out 
 You're doubling back, to your rhyming pad 
 What I represent is MC's gone mad 
 In a perfect world there's imperfect acts 
 We've come like a God to redirect alla that 
 So people with a gift can just flaunt and get money 
 So much, we in the bank that the shit ain't funny 
 Money is invested in real estate and stocks 
 But not inside the glamour 'cause all of that stops 
 Outro: consequence

 Listen to the abstract poetic, don't snub it 
 The midnight marauder is the hype beat arranger 
 Don't front on the lyrics or the two 'cause it's danger 
 Hook you like a junkie, you'll flip like a monkey 
 To the openness of the rhythm, so proceed because I'm funky 
 I get down, down like a fly hooker's panties 
 Make you catch a spirit and motivate a fanny 
 I be the fly poet, rappers, they get jelly 
 Upset when I rock, 'cause yo, they beats is smelly 
 See, I got it goin' on like a forbes tax return 
 Listenin to these lyrics when it's hot will make it burn 
 Baby burn, baby burn, up into the heavens 
 The skies up above, the one you think of 
 Is the highly regarded, hell of the people 
 Your mic and my mic? come on, yo, no equal 
 So if ya wanna do it to yourself 
 That is to mess around with the jazz, then just blame yourself 
 'Cause you made your bed, so now you lay in it 
 That's your (shit) on the floor, then go and play in it 
 I refuse to catch a 'l' in a battle

 I'm forever poppin' junk, it's like a fat invite 
 To any MC who wants to flex, yo, we can do this tonight 
 Gel up my posse up on linden and 1-9-2 
 Pull up my brothas from sayers ave., the brooklyn zoo 
 All my crew up in strong island, so yo, don't sleep 
 'Cause it only takes a peek to watch that (ass) get beat 
 Brothas wanna play rough, but they can all get some 
 Wanna be hero, but you're a zero, that means you gets none 
 Don't ever try to step to a kid you can't get with 
 Why mess with a brotha that your girl once slept with? 
 I'm a negro, he's a negro, wanna be a negro too? 
 But beatin' on a woman, is somethin' that a puss would do 
 I love jazz, but that doesn't mean that I'm timid

 (Verse 1: Q-Tip) 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 Mr. Incognito is back again 
 Now all I want is peace and papes, and a physical frame 
 Jotting down my list of positives in life 
 I want a ride, crib, mutt, wife 
 The look on my girl is filled with conviction 
 Gonna get what I need, to leave restriction 
 Babble on the Boulevard to brother hood buddies 
 Poking in my pocket it's the E for the moneys 
 Jay and all the jokes that jet in the jettas 
 While I'm at the boob tube watching Boo-Betta 
 Swig up on a forty 'cause I'm feeling thirsty 
 Mama says she taught me, better so she cursed me 
 Throwing on my hoodie low-profiling, what's up with the Twister 
 Brother man be wilding 
 While I be on mission that's beyond eye level 
 Questing out the devil and this styles that I sever- 
 Al Quest with the Questers, a Quest on a solo 
 Booming in a Benzo, Beamer or a Bronco 
 Boom pack a boom boom, boom pack a boom 
 If my sight isn't seen, silly saps will assume 
 That we falling off the earth with the Nina and the Pinta 
 The Five Foot Assasin with the shade of magenta 
 (Verse 2: Phife Dawg) 
 Magenta is the shade for the mystic parade 
 Physical Trini boy lyrically I enstrain 
 Living of Lyndon 1-92nd 
 Chilling at the rest other brothers wreck it 
 Easy like I'm on it, Commodore Sunday 
 Waited for Tuesday, for a manic Monday 
 When I woke Wednesday persons was grounding 
 Don't know the whereabouts can't be founding 
 Chilling for the villain the one they call the Phifer 
 Still on the smooth but a tidbit hyper 
 Get with the gat one as I hit the D-L 
 It's my thing what I bring I try to do it well 
 You can bet your bottom dollar that the Tribe will not be slipping 
 Making hit after hit as we commence to start ripping 
 People think I'm bugging or I have the heebiejeebies 
 The reason they can't find me is because they can't see me 
 (Verse 3: Q-Tip) 
 It's like the war's going on in the middle of your mind 
 But your mind can't contain Incognito's on the brain 
 So you chill by yourself don't really sweat nobody 
 Speak to all the brothers and say peace to every hottie 
 But lurking in the ghetto is a germ that insist 
 Should you back the germ away or utilize your fists 
 Neither of the two, just continue with your thoughts 
 And rush away your pain with the power of the thought 
 Ain't got no time for girls, cause girls be on some bull 
 Checking for a nigga who got crazy pull 
 On some deep rooted sexual, highly intellectual 
 Not checking for the fame although it's perpetual 
 I enter the world the same way I'll exit 
 If you really think the groove, than hey glad you checked it 
 Cause Incognito's strong not urking like a blister 
 Before you speak about me, make sure you call me Mister"

 Is peace, prosperity and a little paper 
 Objects that seem greater 
 But I'm sure well over come when we illin on a drum 
 Verse one: q-tip 
 We in a world that places heavy emphasis on money synthesis 
 Y'all can be my witnesses 
 That a fella fascination with money has grown 
 To the point that he will shit on his own 
 We got to have it y'all, it's not a spike lee cinematic 
 A piece of paper makin' niggaz get dramatic 
 But the money doesn't come automatic 
 Gotta motivate ourselves to go and grab it 
 We got to get it y'all, in an orderly fashion 
 Some cats go about it with too much passion 
 We got to mediate our greedy levels 
 'Cause the lust of currency can have us sleepin' with the devil 
 Gotta recognize it, realize the power 
 That this little ma-huckin piece of paper will devour 
 Man can be greater than the thing he creates 
 See, I'ma do my thing and see how much I can scrape 
 Yo I'd rather have respect than money, no doubt 
 But listen to me y'all, I want the mass amount 
 That the sesame street dracula can't count 
 So that I can give my people when that thing surmounts 
 To higher levels... of being... so when I'm MC-ing 
 I hope to see you there steady g-ing (say word) 
 But the only way we can truly reach that goal 
 Is finding true inner peace and prospering souls 
 It's like that 
 Verse two: phife 
 Here comes your royal highness, one of queens finest 
 Believe me, honest, you know you can't stop it 
 Come on son, never leave your mic round me 
 True MC for real ask my man shaheed 
 Strictly focused on what I'm in this rap game for 
 Not for fame and screwing every whore after whore 
 With all that aids stuff going round 
 Tell me how that sound 
 Rather hit the studio and hear some beats that pound 
 Now, don't get me wrong I love honeys galore 
 But see hip-hop's my bread butter 
 Cause that's what I get paid for 
 See this is what I wanted 
 Allah helped me to get it 
 And if the beat is wicked 
 You know malik will rip it 
 From the bottom of my heart 
 That's where the love starts 
 The love for breakdancing 
 My love for the art 
 And with this love I do hip-hop from the soul 
 A real MC, who never sweats how many copies are sold 
 Yeah I want to go gold, platinum, uh-huh etceteras 
 But why put out some wackness when no one will respect ya 
 I'm staying true nuff respect to those that paved the way 
 From bambaata down to shah; that be my DJ 
 Without my peeps I don't know how the hell I'd make it, word 
 Sometimes I feel that my career is headed for the curb 
 One love for the lendin hand and giving all your help 
 Believing in me when I didn't believe in my own self 
 The abstract with whom I'm always making rugged tunes 
 Kid hood restin in heaven, I hope to see you soon 
 I keep things hot and this year they're even hotter 
 Big mu and shah, one day I'll take my shahada

 To see who be the targeted uncle to be the first to fall and fumble

 Profound sentences to pure lyric dems 
 Some of my friends be like a people with stems

 And when I'm at a show chicks never pass out

 A tribe called quest make the party go down 
 Plus we make posite divots to fill up all your crowns 
 Lyrics come to cats like a hot and cold flash 
 So can come with ease if four and a smash 
 Held the fort down like the justice league all the super friends 
 But in the world turn more spins 
 Brothers walk the street with the ill pace face 
 City life breeze contempt for each race 
 All pages due to a law and I should say it 
 It' the abstract, motor, vader, making things, making things better 
 Puttin' things in perspective to rock and roll 
 'Cause you know this kid is got wild soul 
 Of every kind of drama 
 Like stars out pirhanna 
 Cold like ice jazzed hot like a sauna 
 It's the has verse the the half guess who's arrived in the hood 
 Exposing all wrongs it's all good 
 Yo word up, hip-hop is live like a wire 
 Let's get a little bit before the whole joint expire 
 I got to stress it again 
 You see it's for my ken 
 And all my babies 
 Children of the world, no maybe's 
 To you we got to move through 
 And push through 
 Because we got to make it happen keep the true blue

 Shocking female (MC's), shocking female (MC's) (Repeat 2x) 
 Verse 1: Phife 
 No need for, introductions, 'cause I know you know my name and 
 Knocking MC's out the frame and, putting them suckers to shame and 
 I live for hip-hop, so I have no time for fun and games and 
 So just come and peep the unique styles we are displaying 
 The beat's just ridiculous, the lyrics articulate 
 Feels good, as if a girl just touched her (tits) 
 Sucker MC's, I'm killing 'em, I'm so sick of seeing 'em 
 Silly (shit) when they rhyme, like that red rugby shirt worn by Gilligan 
 Plus the hat, they (shit) is wack 
 When you see me coming take ten steps back 
 I make usage of the pronouns, adjectives, verbs 
 My granny says ""You always had a way with words"" 
 And that's because my word is bond, lyrics are laws 
 Sucker MC's look at me like I'm friggin' eye sore 
 Verse 2: Posdnuos 
 Heere comes a brother hipping others on the style they lack 
 I've always rhymed abstract, I even know the brother named Abstract 
 I am the earner of the soul in mine 
 Forget the physical cause the physical will die with time 
 I'm shaped to vibrate in definite proportions 
 Of the kids who need the fix (Just listen to the mix) 
 I just imagine constant non-stop for the rubbishing 
 Like (niggas) use the Clinton loops as if they owned the publishing 
 Ducks be bleeding from illegal feeding on my verb 
 I bring the Mardi Gras to your face 
 I outwit vipers in my rhyme cipher 
 I can easily lick them 'cause they're victims of the subconscious race 
 Tossing periods in front of false reps? 
 It's not the 187 when the 360 slept 
 You swallow the cake from the plate of elevate 
 Or you might get sparked by the crew who got the weight 
 So recessitating rap like the hicks do with Presley 
 It's the kid who peed the jeans in Orleans off of Nesley 
 Just be MC number nine, if you let me rhyme nine times infinitely I will 
 Climb 
 I let my Walkman from Sony play cassettes from Raboni 
 Which guarantees to put me on the narrow road 
 Ayo, that's it from me, Plug 3, and Ali explode! 
 Verse 3: Q-Tip 
 When I rhyme, the effect just ripples 
 You sound sick, I hope your cells get sickles 
 You formulate into real stiff (shit) 
 Then I bet that it cut the chit chit 
 Cause the Ab will, be sharper than a Ginsu 
 Cutter or your bum (ass) head for the gutter 
 This is not a game and we ain't looking for the fame 
 That ain't the aim, we came to rip the jam out the frame 
 My inter-reaction with paper is amazing 
 So needless to say mad trails are left blazing 
 A whole lot of bull (shit) rhymes start to get play 
 But I'm here to say real rhymes to pay 
 I'm the type of brother that writes until my knuckles get nary 
 And through the domepiece, the rhymes will carry 
 Then transported to my throat then the quotes hit the air 
 As I stand dipped with the wares 
 Rhymes get slot times, move back from the jack 
 It's the verbal constructor, some MC's is wack 
 I make a girl do the bogle, doo doo brown and all 
 Make (niggas) jump up, drink Don, and have a ball 
 I ainimate the unlively with the verbal combat 
 The Abstract, never the wack 
 Motivator of the many like Moses 
 Moving through, bringing games into the dummies that pose us 
 That means you the sub relator of the sub culture 
 Like a vulture I swoop down on crowns, cause confusion all around 
 Mental burdens I bring to MC's who sing 
 They sad songs, money, the dough's not long 
 Mine on the other hand is lent me tight 
 The Abstract gets real, real, real 
 Verse 4: Dove 
 Real down to Earth I hit the Long Island Rail 
 You never see me tango with the horn and the tail 
 I got the kid for your mind I design it like sender 
 Smoking made hope from my neighbors, and the 
 50/50 luck takes the ""S"" off my chest 
 Cause the ""S"" on my chest makes a mess 
 Settling for Superman, stupid man, put on your glasses 
 Now your (ass) be slow guessing like molasass 
 Continue the menu, next on the platter 
 Hey where that (bitch) at? (He's right here boy!) 
 I gotta see what I got and who I'm getting it with 
 This ain't no nickel dime game that I'm peddling with 
 Mikie Rose said ""Stop riding, it be dividing 
 Taking me out how I be vibing"" 
 Packing hard like pistol but my pops got the crystal 
 Told me if I ever need it just *whistle* 
 Respects to Griff Dog for the razor 
 Much respects to Joe but for the favor 
 It's about a million brothers trying to make it in this world 
 I'm glad I got a baby girl"
108,A Tribe Called Quest,hiphop,Shaheed,"I don't eat no ham 'n' eggs, 'cause they're high in cholesterol 
 A yo, Phife do you eat em? No, Tip do you eat em? 
 Uh huh, not at all (again) 
 I don't eat no ham 'n' eggs, 'cause they're high in cholesterol 
 Jarobi, do you eat em? Nope, Shah, do you eat em? (Nope) 
 Not at all 
 Q-Tip and Phife (trading lines): 
 A tisket, a tasket, what's in mama's basket? 
 Some veggie links and some fish that stinks 
 Why, just the other day, I went to Grandma's house 
 Smelled like she conjured up a mouse 
 Eggs was fryin, ham was smellin 
 In ten minutes, she started yellin' (come and get it) 
 And the gettin's were good 
 I said, I shouldn't eat, she said, I think you should 
 But I can't, I'm plagued by vegetarians 
 No cats and dogs, I'm not a veterinarian 
 Strictly collard greens and a occasional steak 
 Goes on my plate 
 Asparagus tips look yummy, yummy, yummy 
 Candied yams inside my tummy 
 A collage of good eats, some snacks or nice treats 
 Apple sauce and some nice red beets 
 This is what we snack on when we're Questin' 
 (Both: No second guessin) 
 (Q-Tip: bridge) 
 Phife: 
 Now drop the beat, so I can talk about my favorite tastings 
 The food that is the everlasting, see I'm not fasting 
 I'm gobbling, like a dog on turkey 
 Beef jerky, slim jims, I eat sometimes 
 I like lemons and limes 
 And if not that, take it the road see and the salad sopped 
 Sit back, relax, listen to some hip hop 
 Q-Tip: 
 Gum drops and gummy bears tease my eyes 
 A sight for sore ones and some bore pies 
 And other goodies that are filled with goop 
 With fried apple roots 
 Delectable delights, control my appetites 
 Mine is for me, right, but I know what I like 
 Chicken for lunch, chicken for my dinner 
 Chicken, chicken, chicken, I'm a finger lickin' winner 
 When breakfast time comes, I don't recognize 
 Pig in the pan or a pair of bogey chides 
 Mixed with stewed tomatoes, home fried potatoes 
 Or anything with flair, cook it, I'm in there 
 Pay attention to the Tribe as we impose 
 This is how it goes 
 I don't eat no ham 'n' eggs, 'cause they're high in cholesterol 
 A yo, Phife do you eat em? Nah, Tip do you eat em? 
 Uh huh, not at all (come again, y'all) 
 I don't eat no ham 'n' eggs, 'cause they're high in cholesterol 
 Jarobi, do you eat em? Nope, Shah, do you eat em? 
 Nope, not at all 
 I don't eat no ham 'n' eggs, 'cause they're high in cholesterol 
 Afrika do you eat em? No, Pos, do you eat em? 
 Hell yeah, all the time 
 I don't eat no ham 'n' eggs, 'cause they're high in cholesterol 
 Phife, do you eat em? Nah, Tip, do you eat em? 
 Uh huh, not at all 
 Jarobi, do you eat em? Nope, Shah, do you eat em? 
 Nope, not at all

 Yeah, all the time (laughing)"

 Explaining all my problems to her, gettin' things off my chest 
 A li'l hug up, squeeze up and no more I vent

 Making sure I have my lettercations so I wouldn't pass out

 And we out..."
112,A Tribe Called Quest,hiphop,The Remedy,"Yo, we all got different things we got to deal with. we always are trying 
 To put the blame on something else rather than sometimes looking at 
 Ourselves, recognizing a lot of the stuff that happens... but if we look 
 Within ourselves, we could prevent a lot of this nonsense. it's about 
 Relating back to the essence, where it all stems from. I'm-a do my thing 
 Over this drum, like a native tongue. 
 Verse one 
 Q-tip: 
 Do what you will, if you feel that your steeze is real 
 Complicated with the skills over reel to reel 
 Brown skin is what I feel, my mind and body's appeal 
 Is to the no-frill mills, who hear the beats to chill 
 Constantly, I'm hearing black americans just sneering 
 Looking for a leader who can fill us up with either 
 Hitting us up with great emotional chat 
 About the fact 
 That the black 
 Is constantly held back 
 Like 50 tracks back in a relay race 
 And the white team's ahead 
 So let's keep up the pace 
 And I be needing something 
 To feed my logical taste 
 At the end of the race is there a paradise place? 
 Yo, we can't get involved in what the next man is doing 
 Material gain we put too much in pursuing 
 Yo duke, I need this dough so we can step to this party 
 But we can all mardi grati 
 Minus that shit in our body 
 What that got to do with that 
 'Cause kid that's the essence, 
 Your physical presence 
 Embodies every lesson 
 You can't run the rolls royce if the engine is busted. 
 Can't even life the knife to cut the mustard. 
 What we need to do first 
 Now listen to this verse 
 Let's concentrate on our spiritual plate. 
 Recognize your existence in this vast blue space 
 From a tiny cloud of blood 
 To the human beings with taste, sight, touch, smell 
 And sound 
 Let's deem it profound! 
 And prioritize this cause it was allah's wish 
 Allah? I'm god 
 No I ddon't believe that. that's a mystery 
 If God is so good why does shit be happening to me? 
 There's divinity within 
 Because we come from the divine 
 A froce that's not seen but you feel it every time 
 When the wind blows, and the world turns, 
 And the rain drops, and the baby cries 
 And the bird flies, and the ground quake, 
 And the stars gleam 
 So many things are eident of it's existence 
 What we need to do is link it with persistence 
 Once we recognize that, we can move ahead 
 Native tongue, common sense yo he's hip-hop bred... 
 Common: 
 From the spiritual world my former life has developed 
 First person I lost close to me was stella 
 Some of my mellows 
 Lost their mothers and their brothers 
 For them I feel empathy 
 But I ain't pouring out no liquor for no niggas 
 I pour my heart out when I see dot out on the deck 
 Knowing two weeks ago he slapped-box with death 
 I hear of niggas dying in the wind-in the news 
 But when it's somebody you know it hits you 
 And emotions get bruised 
 I ain't been in your shoes, 
 I won't judge you for knocking 
 Because the spirit of the ghetto says you gotta! 
 They snatch you again from rock flippin' 
 Give back into the neighborhood, you better start kickin' 
 Stickin' stores 
 On the strip 
 I'm tired of arabs giving me my change back 
 Devil bomb my yesterday 
 My tomorrow he never gave back 
 I lay back, looking at the ceiling 
 Wonndering what can I do 
 So my homie won't have to be dealing 
 Not cause you serving and I'm rapping I'm better 
 Just different pieces to the puzzle of black life 
 That we have to put together, better ourselves 
 Cause families we gotta raise 
 No matter how long the money 
 Shorter become the days 
 Men become like women 
 And no difference in the season 
 If you got popped five times 
 You breathing for a reason 
 Let's put the five tenure plan into progression 
 Before we count our paper 
 Count our blessings"
