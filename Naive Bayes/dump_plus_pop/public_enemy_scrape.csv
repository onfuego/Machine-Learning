 Oh-oh Chuck, they out to get us, man 
 Yo, we got to dust these boys off 
 (Chuck D) 
 In this corner with the 98 
 Subject of suckers, object of hate 
 Who's the one some think is great? 
 I'm that one (son of a gun) 
 Drivin' by wavin' my fist 
 Making 'em mad when I'm goin' like this 
 Top gun, never on the run 
 (They know not to come 'cause they all get some) 
 Goin' quicker in the speeding lane 
 Jealous can't do it and it's causin' them pain 
 Caught in my smoke, all they did was choke 
 Look at my spokes, you know I'm no joke 
 Out that window, middle finger for all 
 Jealous at my ride, stereo and blackwalls 
 Suckers they got the nerve and gall 
 (To talk about the car when they're walking tall) 
 Suckers to the side, I know you hate my 98 
 You're gonna get yours 
 Suckers to the side, I know you hate my 98 
 You're gonna get yours 
 (Chuck D) 
 Pulling away every day 
 Leavin' you in the dust so you know I get paid 
 On the mile ego trip and 5-0 tailing on my tip 
 Watch me burn rubber, fall in my flame 
 This episode is always the same 
 Seein' no comp coming like I'm blind 
 All left back trailing my behind 
 I go faster, cops try to shoot me 
 They'll get theirs when they try to get me 
 I'll let it go, my turbo 
 Run 'em in the river 'cause they're moving too slow 
 Laughing hard at their attempt 
 So what if the judge charges me contempt 
 I'll rub my boomerang 'cause I'm feeling proud 
 And I wouldn't even hear 'em cause my radio's loud 
 Suckers to the side, I know you hate my 98 
 You're gonna get yours 
 Suckers to the side, I know you hate my 98 
 You're gonna get yours 
 (Chuck D) 
 Cruisin' down the boulevard 
 I'm treated like some superstar 
 You know the time so don't look hard 
 (Get with it, the ultimate homeboy car) 
 All you suckers in the other rides 
 Wherever I'm coming get to my side 
 My 98 is tough to chase 
 If you're on my tail better watch your face 
 Smoke is coming when I burn 
 Rubber when my wheels turn 
 A tinted window, so super bad 
 Looking like the car the Green Hornet had 
 It's the reason I'm ahead of the pack 
 It's the reason I left them back 
 It's the reason all the people say 
 My 98 Olds blows 'em all away 
 My 98 Oldsmobile is 
 My 98 Oldsmobile's so 
 My 98 Oldsmobile is 
 My 98 Oldsmobile's like 
 Suckers to the side, I know you hate my 98 
 You're gonna get yours 
 Suckers to the side, I know you hate my 98 
 You're gonna get yours 
 (Chuck D) 
 Understand, I don't drive drunk 
 My 98's fly, I don't drive no junk 
 No cop got a right to call me a punk 
 Take this ticket, go to hell and stick it 
 Put me on a kickbutt line up, times up 
 This government needs a tune up 
 I don't know what's happenin', what's up 
 Gun in my chest, I'm under arrest 
 Sidewalk suckers wanted to spill me 
 So I got my crew and posse 
 Took the girls and got them to thrill me 
 Stepped outside, got in my ride 
 Drove 'em around and I looked around town 
 Caught 'em out there cold, ran 'em over and down 
 They didn't get me and that's the truth 
 (Cause the 98-O is bullet proof) 
 My 98 Oldsmobile's so 
 My 98 Oldsmobile is 
 My 98 Oldsmobile's so 
 My 98 Oldsmobile's like"
1,Public Enemy,hiphop,Sophisticated Bitch,"That woman in the corner, cold playin' the role 
 Just leave her ass in the corner till her feet get cold 
 Knowin' for a fact, that girl is whacked 
 If you hold your hand out, she'll turn her back 
 Better walk, don't talk, she's all pretend 
 Can't be her friend unless you spend 
 Wall to wall, after all 
 Get ready to throw only money at the bitch 
 'Cause she thinks she's so- 
 Phisticated 
 Peekin', seekin' inside a book 
 Her demands for a man with a chemical look 
 Wishes, desires, gettin' worse with age 
 She doesn't want a man, all she wants is a page 
 Ain't got a man so she goes to a club 
 She think it's classy but it's really a pub 
 But that's the kind of place she likes to go 
 The bitch got a problem 
 'Cause she thinks she's so- 
 Phisticated 
 Jackets, shoes, everyday ties 
 The girl only wants one of those guys 
 Suckers who front like it ain't no thing 
 Pretend to be friends, don't want that thang 
 Talk like this, don't talk slang 
 Do anything to get that thang 
 Tries to be chic and play it off 
 Peekin' through the window, I saw her take her clothes off 
 Nasty girl, stone cold freak 
 Stayin' in bed a whole goddamn week 
 Comin' and leavin' guys servin' up storms 
 From execs with checks, boys from the dorms 
 Never kept a name, never seen a face 
 She could pass 'em in the street like it never took place 
 I know she's a ho I'm on the go 
 Expose the funky bitch 
 'Cause she thinks she's so- 
 Phisticated 
 Now she wants a sucker but with an attache 
 And if you ain't got it, she'll turn you away 
 You can smile with stile but you lost your trial 
 Cause you got a gold tooth, she thinks you're wild 
 She don't want a brother that's true and black 
 If you're light, you're all right, better you stay back 
 Cause the sucker with the bag is out the catch 
 With something in his bag keepin' her attached 
 The man's got a plan, it's IBM 
 The devil at her level, yes it's him 
 His Audi she rides, his gold and clothes 
 The ill base method, turning up her nose 
 Lack a lack a lack, now beaming her up 
 She still got the nerve to turn her funky nose up 
 Her status looks at us from down below 
 Now the bitch is in trouble 
 'Cause she was so- 
 Phisticated 
 Little is known about her past 
 So listen to me 'cause I know her ass 
 Used to steal money out her boyfriends clothes 
 And never got caught, so the story goes 
 She kept doin' that to all her men 
 Found the wrong man when she did it again 
 And still to this day people wonder why 
 He didn't beat the bitch down till she almost died 
 So- 
 Phisticated"
2,Public Enemy,hiphop,Miuzi Weighs A Ton,"Yo Chuck, run a power move on them 
 (Yeah) 
 (Verse 1 - Chuck D) 
 Step back, get away - give the brother some room 
 You got to all turn me up when the beat goes boom 
 Lyric to lyric - line to line 
 Then you y'all understand my reputation for rhyme 
 Cause my rhyme reputation depends on what 
 Style of record my DJ cuts 
 His slice an' dice - super mix so nice 
 So bad, you won't dispute the price 
 'Cause it's plain to see - it's a strain to be 
 Number one in the public eye enemy 
 'Cause I'm wanted in 50 - almost 51 
 States where the posse got me on the run 
 It's a big wonder why I haven't gone under 
 Dodgin' all types of microphone thunder 
 A fugitive missin' all types of hell 
 All this because I talk so well 
 When I 
 Rock - get up - get down 
 Miuzi weighs a ton 
 Hold it 
 (Verse 2 - Chuck D) 
 The match up title - the expression of thrill 
 For elite to compete and attempt to get ill 
 If looks could kill - I'd chill until 
 All the public catches on to my material - you know 
 The ducks criticize my every phase of rapture 
 Can't wait to read the headlines of my capture 
 Accused of assault - a 1st degree crime 
 'Cause I beat competitors with my rhyme 
 Tongue whipped, pushed, shoved and tripped 
 Choked from the hold of my Kung Fu grip 
 And if you want my title - it would be suicidal 
 From my end - it would be homicidal 
 When I do work - you get destroyed 
 All the paranoid - know to avoid 
 The Public Enemy seat I've enjoyed 
 This is no kid and I'm not no toy boy 
 Rock - get up - get down 
 Miuzi weighs a ton 
 Hold it 
 (Verse 3 - Chuck D) 
 I'm a Public Enemy but I don't rob banks 
 I don't shoot bullets and I don't shoot blanks 
 My style is supreme - number one is my rank 
 And I got more power than the New York Yanks 
 If Miuzi wasn't heavy I'd probably fire it 
 I'd make you walk the plank if I was a pirate 
 If they made me a King - I would be a tyrant 
 If you want to get me - go ahead and try it 
 Snatcher, dispatcher, biter never been a 
 Instead of takin' me out - take a girl to dinner 
 The level of comp has never been thinner 
 It's a runaway race where I'm the winner 
 It's unreal - they call the law 
 And claimed I had started a war 
 It was war they wanted and war they got 
 But they wilted in the heat when Miuzi got hot 
 Rock - get up - get down 
 Miuzi weighs a ton 
 Hold it 
 (Verse 4 - Chuck D) 
 My style versatile said without rhymes 
 Which is why they're after me an' on my back 
 Lookin' over my shoulder - seein' what I write 
 Hearin' what I say - then wonderin' why 
 Why they can't ever compete on my level 
 Superstar status is my domain 
 Understand my rhythm - my pattern of lecture 
 And then you'll know why I'm on the run 
 This change of events results in a switch 
 It's the lateral movement of my vocal pitch 
 It eliminates pressure on the haunted 
 But the posse is around so I got to front it 
 Plus employ tactics so coy 
 And leave no choice but to destroy 
 Soloists, groups and what they say 
 And all that try to cross my way 
 When I 
 Rock - get up - get down 
 Miuzi weighs a ton 
 Hold it 
 Yeah, that's right 
 Public Enemy number one in New York 
 Public Enemy number one in Philly 
 Public Enemy number one in DC 
 Public Enemy number one in Cleveland, Ohio 
 Also where Public Enemy number one in St. Louis 
 Public Enemy number one in New Jersey 
 And bust it 
 Where also, Public Enemy number one in Cincinnati 
 In Atlanta"
3,Public Enemy,hiphop,Timebomb,"(Intro - Flavor Flav) 
 Hey, Chuck, we got some non-believers out there... 
 Yo, we got to do somethin' about that, man... 
 Yo, we got to get stupid 
 Yo, we gotta let 'em know what time it is 
 (Verse 1 - Chuck D) 
 You go ooh and ah when I jump in my car 
 People treat me like Kareem Abdul Jabbar 
 No matter who you are, when I'm up to par 
 I betcha go hip hop, hurray or hurrah 
 But the ahhs and ohhs is my kind of news 
 Pop your tape in, put your car in cruise 
 I never heard the boos, I never drank booze 
 'Cause I just rock the rhythm, left alone the blues 
 The L.I. mystique, You sneak to peek 
 A look and then you know that we're never weak 
 I know you can't wait, it's never too late 
 No fear I'm here, and everything is straight 
 Cycles, cycles, life runs in cycles 
 New is old, no I'm not no psycho 
 The monkey on the back makes the best excel 
 The people in the crowd makes the rock well 
 The people in the back lets you know who's whack 
 And those who lack, the odds are stacked 
 The one who makes the money is white not black 
 You might not believe it but it's like that 
 When you come to my show, watch me throw 
 Down with the other brothers toe to toe 
 When you make a move, new not used 
 And watch the bro here just bust a groove 
 A fat lady soprano, loads my ammo 
 And hear my jam, with a funky piano 
 Easy on the wall but hard on the panel 
 A fool smokes Kools 'cause he chokes on Camels 
 In effect, the crew's in check 
 Run by the posse with the gold around the neck 
 Homeboys in heat, lookin' for sweet 
 Ladies in the crowd so they can meet 
 Somebody to body, makin' a baby 
 Givin' it to grandma then makin' her crazy 
 I'm a MC protector, U.S. defector 
 South African government wrecker 
 Panther power, you can feel it in my arm 
 Lookout y'all 'cause I'm a timebomb 
 Tickin', tockin', all about rockin' 
 Makin' much dollars while the crazy one's clockin' 
 The rhythm, to shake the house downy down 
 Bounce to the ounce, sound so crown 
 The man, the enemy, Public King, no 
 All fall to the force of my swing 
 Like Ali, Frazier, Thriller in Manila 
 A pinpoint point blank microphone killer am I 
 No need to lie, got the Flavor Flav 
 To prove ill win and if not the save 
 I'll pick up, rack up - put your whole shack up 
 Just choose to lose the bet, emcee stick up 
 This is the wiz, but the mike's not his, it's mine 
 One time let the star shine 
 And I'm tellin' you, yelling at you you're through 
 Don't think you're grown because your moustache grew 
 I'm number one, you know it weighs a ton 
 And I'll be the burger, you can be the bun, girl 
 Surroundin', my steady poundin' 
 Get, get on down to my funky sound 
 And rock the rhythm rhyme, one time your mind 
 Rhythm roll, two times control 
 The mauler and the caller of your doom 
 And when I'm ready to leave, you're gonna know I go boom 
 Three times y'all, rhythm rhyme and rock 
 Then you'll that the D is on the block 
 Four times y'all and never ever the whack 
 It's the hour to the minute, time to blow BLACK"
4,Public Enemy,hiphop,Too Much Posse,"(Intro - Flavor Flav) 
 What do you got to say about this 
 A force so strong that you can't resist 
 You may as well join'em, you know you can't beat'em 
 Pack a hundred people, ya know ya gonna need'em 
 Straight with the system is down by law 
 Cause every half hour they get nine more 
 They run all dollars that come in town 
 Either join the crew or get beat down 
 I watched all the guys be so damn cruel 
 Try to get fast, you must be a fool 
 Blood through and through, the boys don't play 
 I seen'em tax and run an operation today 
 They had too, too, too much posse 
 Yeah, I had a party, much people came by 
 I'm talking to a 'g' cause the 'g' real fly 
 Chillin' in my room, chewin' off her ear 
 Chillin' stupid fly 'cause I got stupid gear 
 My door kicked open by her man and crew 
 The 'g' turned turned to me and said, ""Who you?"" 
 So I said, ""Yo fly, yeah the 'g' lied"" 
 Stuck in the corner while the 'g' cried 
 And then from the back, my homeboys came 
 Their uzis and nines and said ""don't blame"" 
 Ya lying ass girl with the fake tears 
 We got a big posse and we show no fears 
 We got too, too, too much posse 
 We got too, too, too much posse"
5,Public Enemy,hiphop,Rightstarter (Message To A Black Man),"Mind over matter, mouth in motion 
 Can't defy 'cause I'll never be quiet 
 Let's start this 
 Right 
 You spend a buck in the 80's, whatcha you get is a preacher 
 Forgivin' this torture of the system that brought cha 
 I'm on a mission and you got that right 
 Addin' fuel to the fire, punch to the fight 
 Many have forgotten what we came here for 
 Never knew or had a clue so you're on the floor 
 Just growin', not knowin' about your past 
 Now you're lookin' pretty stupid while you're shakin' your ass 
 Mind over matter, mouth in motion 
 Can't defy 'cause I'll never be quiet 
 Let's start this 
 Right 
 Some people fear me when I talk this way 
 Some come near me, some run away 
 Some people take heed to every word I say 
 Some wanna build a posse, some stay away 
 Some people think that we plan to fail 
 Wonder why we go under or we go to jail 
 Some ask us why we act the way we act 
 Without lookin' how long they kept us back 
 Mind over matter, mouth in motion 
 Can't defy 'cause I'll never be quiet 
 Let's start this 
 Right 
 Yes, you if I bore you, I won't ignore you 
 I'm sayin' things that they say I'm not supposed to 
 Give you pride that you may not find 
 If you're blind about your past then I'll point behind 
 Kings, queens, warriors, lovers 
 People, proud sisters and brothers 
 Their biggest fear, suckers get tears 
 When we can top their best idea 
 Mind over matter, mouth in motion 
 Can't defy, 'cause I'll never be quiet 
 Let's start this 
 Right 
 Mind revolution, our solution 
 Mind over matter, mouth in motion 
 Corners don't sell it, no, you can't buy it 
 Defy 'cause I'll never be quiet 
 Let's start this 
 Right 
 Our solution, mind revolution 
 Can't sell it, no, you can't buy it in a potion 
 You lie about the life that you wanted to try 
 Tellin' me about a head you decided to fly 
 Another brother with the same woes that you face 
 But you shot with the same hands, you fall from grace 
 Every brother should be every brother's keeper 
 But you shot with your left while your right was on your beeper 
 Mind over matter, mouth in motion 
 Can't defy, 'cause I'll never be quiet 
 Let's start this 
 Right 
 As the world turns, it's a terrible waste 
 To see the stupid look stuck on your face 
 Time bomb alarm for the world, just try it 
 Known to all zones as the one man riot 
 I'm on a mission to set you straight 
 Children it's not too late 
 Explain to the world when it's plain to see 
 To be what the world doesn't want us to be

 Can't defy, 'cause I'll never be quiet

6,Public Enemy,hiphop,Public Enemy No. 1,"(Intro: Flavor Flav) 
 Yo Chuck, bust a move man 
 I was on my way up here to the studio, you know what I'm saying 
 And this brother stopped me and asked me 
 ""Yo, what's up with that brother Chuckie D, he swear he nice?"" 
 I said, ""Yo, the brother don't swear he nice, he knows he's nice"", you know what I'm saying 
 So Chuck, we got a feeling you turning into a Public Enemy, man 
 Now remember that line you was kicking to me on the way out to L.A. Laurelton Queens 
 While we was in the car on our way to the shop 
 Well yo, right now, kick the bass for them brothers and let 'em know 
 What goes on 
 (Verse 1: Chuck D) 
 What goes on? 
 Well I'm all in, put it up on the board 
 Another rapper shot down from the mouth that roared 
 1-2-3 down for the count 
 The result of my lyrics, oh yes, no doubt 
 Cold rock rap - 49er supreme 
 Is what I choose and I use, I never lose to a team 
 'Cause I can go solo, like a Tyson bolo 
 Make the fly girls wanna have my photo 
 Run in their room, hang it on the wall 
 In remembrance that I rocked them all 
 Suckers, ducks, ho-hum emcees 
 You can't rock the kid, so go cut the cheese 
 Take this application of rhymes like these 
 My rap's red hot, 110 degrees 
 So don't start bassing, I'll start placing 
 Bets on that you'll be disgracing 
 You and your mind from my beating from my rhymes 
 A time for a crime that I can't find 
 I'll show you my gun, my Uzi weighs a ton 
 Because I'm Public Enemy number one 
 One, one, one, one 
 One, one, one, one! 
 (Verse 2: Chuck D) 
 You got no rap but you want to battle 
 It's like having a boat but you've got no paddle 
 'Cause I never pause, I say it because 
 I don't break in stores but I break all laws 
 Written while sitting, all bidding not hidden 
 Giving me the juice that you're not getting 
 I'm not a law obeyer, so you can tell your mayor 
 I'mma non-stop, rhythm rock, poetry sayer 
 I'm the rhyme player, the ozone layer 
 A battle what? Here's a bible so start your prayer 
 This word to the wise is justified 
 If they ask you what happened, just admit you lied 
 You just got caught up, for going out of order 
 And now you're serving football teams their water 
 You messed with the Master, word to Chuck 
 And I waxed cold taxed, make sure you got dunked 
 You just got dissed, all but dismissed 
 Sucker duck emcees you get me pissed 
 It's no fun being on the run 
 Because they got me Public Enemy number one 
 One, one, one, one 
 One, one, one, one! 
 (Verse 3: Chuck D) 
 Don't you know, don't you know... 
 I got a posse of a force to back me up 
 Watch out, we got metal to match 
 Ambush attack on my back, double-team you get creamed 
 So we have it, so you won't catch 
 Wanna hear it again we got a force, enemy down 
 The L.I. circuit sound 
 And Chuckie D, myself and K-Jee, Flavor, DJ Melo-D 
 Oh yes, I presume it's the tunes that make us groom 
 To make all the ladies swoon 
 But it's also the words from our direction, out the homeboy section 
 Kicking like Bruce Lee ""Chinese Connection"" 
 On stereo, never ever mono 
 On wax, yes, I'm talking about vinyl 
 They said ""Stop! Freeze!"" I got froze up 
 Because I'm Public Enemy number one 
 One, one, one, one 
 One, one, one, one! 
 (Verse 4: Chuck D) 
 For all you 
 Suckers, liars, your cheap amplifiers 
 Your crossed up wires are always starting fires 
 You grown up criers, now here's a pair of pliers 
 Get a job like your mother, heard she fixes old dryers 
 You have no desires, your father fixes tires 
 You try to sell your equipment but you get no buyers 
 It's you they never hire, you're never on flyers 
 Cause you and your crew is only known as good triers 
 Known as the poetic, political, lyrical son 
 I'm Public Enemy number one 
 One, one, one, one 
 One, one, one, one! 
 (Outro: Flavor Flav) 
 Yeah, that's right Chuck, man 
 That's what you gotta do 
 You gotta tell 'em just like that, you know what I'm saying 
 Cause yo man, let me tell you a little something man 
 These brothers running around, hard headed 
 They get a little jealous, you know what I'm saying 
 Just like that, you know, they're trying to bring you down with them 
 But yo Chuck, you got to let them know who's who in the world to be 
 You got to let them know, that this is the 80's 
 And we can get all the ladies 
 And in the backyard we got a fly Mercedes 
 And that's the way the story goes 
 That's just the way the story goes 
 Let me tell you a little something man"
7,Public Enemy,hiphop,M.P.E.,"I'm cold gettin' busy while I'm shakin' you down 
 I'm on the air, you're on the ground 
 Chuck D, the enemy, words you heed 
 Build for speed, but what you need is 
 Funky fresh lyrics fallin' down on time 
 Your enemy poppin' it, droppin' a dime 
 Comin' back rockin' a tomahawk slam 
 And still gettin' fly with the mike in my hand 
 I'm cold coolin' out, layin in the shade 
 Dealers buggin 'cause they're gonna get sprayed 
 Their intimidator, your Scarface 
 What's goin' on (huh) what's takin' place 
 I don't wear gold but I clock ducats 
 And I have the money overflowing out of buckets 
 You want crazy dollars, I make people holler 
 You stick 'em stupid and I'm snatching biters collars 
 I'll rebuilt the mine to alleviate 
 Unnecessary pressures that can create 
 The sting that stung Yama-Goochie Foo Yung 
 When he bit the Public Enemy he only got hung 
 Cause his brain was gettin' bigger than a pregnant toad 
 His heartbeat stopped cause of overload 
 I made the beat that broke his back 
 I cut his circulation made his world turn back 
 I find out things like E.S.P 
 Amazing world of Kreskin's brain velocity 
 Like Alexander Mundy, I'm in like Flint 
 Mercedes limousine with a hardcore tint 
 I'm captain of the ship, I make 'em walk the planks 
 Riding round the world, hundred sixty million francs 
 Not like the kind that you put on the grill 
 'Cause I only do it like that when I'm on a chill hill 
 When I get to the beach, the ground's so sandy 
 Girls on my jock like ants on candy 
 Checking out the fellas with the girls on the side 
 Put ya boat in the water, let's take a ride 
 To the land of party people rocking shocking to the beat 
 So keep ya eyes on ya girl cause ya know I'm gonna cheat 
 I'm gonna max and relax and chill my will 
 Body rockin', brain shockin' makes your heart stand still 
 I'm goin' for the money that man ever made 
 Gettin' thrill from orders, suckers obeyed 
 It's gettin' late and I can't wait 
 To drive by the bus and rock my tape 
 My car is movin', fast like a train 
 Never skid off the road, even in the rain 
 Cold dodgin' tickets, rockin' all the jams 
 Make biters step back and understand"
8,Public Enemy,hiphop,Yo! Bum Rush The Show,"I am taking no prisoners, taking no shorts 
 Breakin' with the metal of a couple of forts 
 While we're hearin' that boom supplement the mix 
 We're gonna rush 'em like the Bears in the 46 
 Homeboys I don't know but they're part of the pack 
 In the plan against the man, bum rush attack 
 For the suckers at the door, if you're up and around 
 For the suckers at the door, we're gonna knock you back down 
 Yo! Bum rush the show! 
 Searching my body for fuckin' what 
 Cause my gun's just for fun and knife don't cut 
 How can I make you understand 
 I get ill on a posse with my goddamn hands 
 Troubles, not me, I don't mean to cause 
 But you took one look and began to pause 
 Didn't holler at the dollar we willin' to spend 
 But you took one look and wouldn't let our ass in 
 Yo! Bum rush the show! 
 Cold bum rushin' doors like at first it's something 
 But all we realize that the show ain't nothin' 
 For the stunts and the blunts, whole world inside 
 The reason that the mighty used force supplied 
 No comp, we'll stomp all in our way 
 Gave me static so I won't pay 
 It might be a trick that you don't like 
 Comin' in the side door then grabbin' the mike 
 Walkin' and talkin' - fist full in the air 
 It might seem like that we don't care 
 A ho for an oh, a pow for an ow 
 Girls start screamin' all I say is wow 
 Get that sucker who shot that gun 
 Whip his monkey ass till it ain't no fun 
 5-O showed and wouldn't you know 
 They blamed it on the kid cause all I said was... 
 Yo! Bum rush the show!"
9,Public Enemy,hiphop,Raise The Roof,"Raise your hands, so we can 
 Raise the roof, so you can 
 Raise your voice, so we can 
 Raise the roof 
 Raise the roof because it's all on fire 
 Not done by the sun or electrical wire 
 Not done by sons striking matches with daughters 
 But done by scratches so save that water 
 This jam is packed so I just figure 
 All we need is the house to get bigger 
 So startin' with the roof down to the base 
 We're at your service to burn the place 
 Come on 
 Come on raise the roof 
 Come on 
 Raise the roof 
 Come on 
 With the spot as hot as it can get 
 The roof's on fire, you're soaked and wet 
 The puzzle on your face shows as you sweat 
 But your body keeps movin' with no regrets 
 Chandeliers shake, swing from front to back 
 Left to right all night, and the lights don't crack 
 Your minds on the time, hopin' it don't end 
 It's time to get stupid, here we go again 
 Come on 
 Come on raise the roof 
 Come on 
 Raise the roof 
 Come on 
 Stare at the strope, pull your earlobe 
 For the sights and sounds clear across the globe 
 This jam might hit or miss the charts 
 But the style gets wild as state of the art 
 Dazzling in science, bold in nerve 
 But givin' my house what it deserves 
 Served on the floor 'cause I got played 
 Make the fans that left, wished they had'a stayed 
 Realize my friend, ain't this a trip 
 As your body gets railed when you do the flip 
 And your mind gets rocked when we're on a roll 
 Then the freak of the week makes you lose control 
 A Swatch for a watch, so you'll know the time 
 Your crowd gets loud and you clock my rhyme 
 The messiah's on fire and I'm living proof 
 I'll quench your desire and raise your roof 
 Come on 
 Come on raise the roof 
 Come on 
 Raise the roof 
 Come on 
 In school I'm cool throughout the week 
 When the weekend comes, I'm down with the Greeks 
 Frat brothers known across the seven seas 
 Fly ladies of the 80's, sororities 
 Zetas, Deltas, AKA's 
 Women that keep me in a daze 
 Phi Sigma boys in the move 
 With the Kappas and the Ques and of course the Grooves too 
 And for real it's the deal and the actual fact 
 Takes a nation of millions to hold me back 
 Rejected and accepted as a communist 
 Claimin' fame to my name as a terrorist 
 Makin' money in corners that you'll never see 
 Dodgin' judges and the lawyers and the third degree 
 Nothin' wrong with a song to make the strong survive 
 Realize gave me five 'cause I kept 'em alive 
 Mislead what you read bout my devilish deeds 
 Mislead what I said so you're better off dead 
 Make 'em hear it and see it for the Def and blind 
 And command it and we'll plan it for incapable minds 
 Take for granted and demand it from the wave of my hand 
 Make the jealous understand it, just say damn 
 When they see me ask a question, ""How the hell can it be?"" 
 When they watch me pull a serpent straight out of the sea 
 Turn the winter into summer, then from hot to cold 
 Expand my power on the hour, make you all behold 
 From the slammer swing a hammer like the mighty Thor 
 God of thunder, you'll go under, then you'll all applaud 
 And fathom that distance that the mad must reap 
 Meet Namor sea lord, Prince of the deep 
 Here for you to fear at any cost 
 Tellin' you to get busy or you better get lost 
 Livin' lives civilized from the lessons I taught 
 Cities buried underground just because I went off 
 My friends, enemies, better be my friend 
 Is the question people guessin' is this the end? 
 End of the world, are you guessin' yes? 
 Just say don't delay it, get it off your chest 
 Houses of crack, I've seen too much 
 I go ready, aim, fire, then I'll blow 'em up"
10,Public Enemy,hiphop,Megablast,"Time is gettin' crazy, people clockin' out 
 They're robbin' all the cribs on a death wish route 
 Breakin' into cars trying to steal their system 
 20 pounds on the bar, betcha can't lift 'em 
 Ya throw two punches, now you got no wind 
 Hittin' mega pipes, gettin' super stupid thin 
 Crying all the tears, smokin' all the squares 
 Workin' for ya boy, ya came short and full of swears 
 Ya couldn't make the money cause ya smoked up the product 
 Walkin' round the town, skeptalepsy illaroduct 
 Can't be trusted 'cause you're living in the past 
 Ya should have kept yo ass away from that blast 
 Oh please, oh please, oh please, oh please 
 Just give me just one more hit 
 (Megablast) 
 I got a homeboy who is out on the block 
 He sells mo crack that they sell fish at the dock 
 He runs to every car, thinkin' he's a star 
 He gets his product snatched by some people in a car 
 The car pulls off, he hung onto the side 
 Of the car that is in motion, guess his product took a ride 
 He tried to sell a dime for a thirty dollar bill 
 Fake gold plate on the back, no frill 
 Fake Hawaiian suit, scratched up knees 
 In his fridgerator, bread, water, cheese 
 Antique fork, how long will it last? 
 We'll see in twelve minutes when he wants the blast 
 Oh please, oh please, oh please, oh please 
 Just give me just one more hit

 Cause we always knew this, haha 
 Yeah, boy 
 Bass, how low can you go 
 Death row, what a brother know 
 Once again, back is the incredible rhyme animal 
 The uncannable D, public enemy number one 
 Five-O said “freeze” and I got numb 
 Can I tell 'em that I never really had a gun 
 But it's the wax that the Terminator X spun 
 Now they got me in a cell cause my records, they sell 
 Cause a brother like me said, well 
 Farrakhan's a prophet and I think you ought to listen to 
 What he can say to you 
 What you ought to do is follow for now 
 Power of the people, say 
 Make a miracle, D, pump the lyrical

 Hey yo, Chuck, they say we too black, man (bring the noise) 
 Yo, I don’t understand what they’re sayin' 
 But little do they know, they can get a smack for that, man 
 Never badder than bad cause the brother is madder than mad 
 At the fact that's corrupt like a senator 
 Soul on a roll, but you treat it like soap on a rope 
 Cause the beats and the lines are so dope 
 Listen for lessons I'm saying inside music 
 That the critics are blasting me for 
 They'll never care for the brothers and sisters 
 Now across the country has us up for the war 
 We got to demonstrate, come on now 
 They're gonna have to wait, till we get it right 
 Radio stations, I question their blackness 
 They call themselves black, but we'll see if they'll play this

 Yo, Chuck, show 'em what you can do, boy 
 Get from in front of me, the crowd runs to me 
 My deejay is warm, he's X, I call him Norm, y'know 
 He can cut a record from side to side 
 So what, the ride, the glide much should be safer than a suicide 
 Soul control, beat is the father of your rock'n'roll 
 Music for whatcha, for whichin', you call a band, man 
 Making a music, abuse it, but you can't do it, y'know 
 You call 'em demos (but we ride limos, too) 
 Whatcha gonna do, rap is not afraid of you 
 Beat is for Sonny Bono (beat is for Yoko Ono) 
 Run-DMC first said a deejay could be a band 
 Stand on its feet, get you out your seat 
 Beat is for Eric B. and LL as well, hell (wax is for Anthrax) 
 Still it can rock bells

 Come on 
 Come on 
 Come on now 
 Come on 
 From coast to coast, so you stop being like a comatose 
 Stand, my man, the beat's the same with a boast toast 
 Rock with some pizzazz, it will last, why you ask 
 Roll with the rock stars, still never get accepted as 
 We got to plead the Fifth, you can investigate 
 No need to wait, get the record straight (hey) 
 Posse in effect, got Flavor, Terminator 
 X to sign checks, play to get paid 
 You got to check it out down on the avenue 
 A magazine or two is dissing me and dissing you 
 Yeah, I'm telling you 
 Ay yo, Griff, get the S1W 
 We got to handle this 
 We ain’t goin' out like that 
 Yo man, straight up on the Columbo tip 
 We can do this like Brutus

 Chuck D and Flavor Flav: 
 Back 
 Caught you looking for the same thing 
 It's a new thing, check out this I bring 
 Uh, oh, the roll below the level, 'cause I'm living low 
 Next to the bass, (C'mon), turn up the radio 
 They claiming I'm a criminal 
 But now I wonder how, some people never know 
 The enemy could be their friend, guardian 
 I'm not a hooligan, I rock the party and 
 Clear all the madness, I'm not a racist 
 Preach to teach to all ('Cause some they never had this) 
 Number one, not born to run, about the gun 
 I wasn't licensed to have one 
 The minute they see me, fear me 
 I'm the epitome, a public enemy 
 Used, abused without clues 
 I refuse to blow a fuse 
 They even had it on the news 
 Flavor Flav: 
 Don't believe the hype 
 Don't, don't, don't 
 Don't believe the hype 
 Don't 
 Don't, don't, don't 
 Don't believe the hype 
 Chuck D and Flavor Flav: 
 ""Yes"" was the start of my last jam 
 So here it is again, another def jam 
 But since I gave you all a little something that I knew you lacked 
 They still consider me a new jack 
 All the critics you can hang 'em, I'll hold the rope 
 But they hope to the Pope, and pray it ain't dope 
 The follower of Farrakhan 
 Don't tell me that you understand until you hear the man 
 The book of the new school rap game 
 Writers treat me like Coltrane, insane 
 Yes to them, but to me I'm a different kind 
 We're brothers of the same mind, unblind 
 Caught in the middle and not surrendering 
 I don't rhyme for the sake of riddling 
 Some claim that I'm a smuggler 
 Some say I never heard of ya, a rap burglar 
 False media, we don't need it do we? 
 (It's fake that's what it be to ya, dig me? 
 Yo, Terminator X, step up on the stand 
 And show these people what time it is boy) 
 Flavor Flav:

 Chuck D, Flavor Flav and Harry Allen: 
 Don't believe the hype, it's a sequel 
 As an equal can I get this through to you 
 My 98 booming with a trunk of funk 
 All the jealous punks can't stop the dunk 
 Coming from the school of hard knocks 
 Some perpetrate, they drink Clorox 
 Attack the Black, because I know they lack exact 
 The cold facts, and still they try to Xerox 
 The leader of the new school, uncool 
 Never played the fool, just made the rules 
 Remember there's a need to get alarmed 
 Again I said I was a time bomb 
 In the daytime radio's scared of me 
 'Cause I'm mad, plus I'm the enemy 
 They can't come on and play me in prime time 
 'Cause I know the time, 'cause I'm getting mine 
 I get on the mix late in the night 
 They know I'm living right, so here go the mike, sike 
 Before I let it go, don't rush my show 
 You try to reach and grab and get elbowed 
 Word to Herb, yo if you can't swing this 
 Learn the words, you might sing this 
 Just a little bit of the taste of the bass for you 
 As you get up and dance at the LQ 
 When some deny it, defy it, I swing Bolos 
 And then they clear the lane I go solo 
 The meaning of all of that, some media is the wack 
 As you believe it's true 
 It blows me through the roof 
 Suckers, liars, get me a shovel 
 Some writers I know are damn devils 
 For them I say, don't believe the hype 
 (Yo Chuck, they must be on the pipe, right?) 
 Their pens and pads I'll snatch 'cause I've had it 
 I'm not a addict fiending for static 
 I'll see their tape recorder and I grab it 
 (No, you can't have it back, silly rabbit) 
 I'm going to my media assassin 
 Harry Allen, I gotta ask him 
 (Yo Harry, you're a writer, are we that type?)

 (Yeah boy, part two bum rush the show) 
 Yo Griff get the green, black and red, and 
 Gold down, countdown to Armageddon 
 '88 you wait the S1's will 
 Put the left in effect and I still will 
 Rock the hard jams, treat it like a seminar 
 Reach the bourgeois and rock the boulevard 
 Some say I'm negative, but they're not positive 
 But what I got to give 
 Flavor Flav and Chuck D: 
 The media says this? 
 Yo don't believe that hype (Red black and green) 
 They got to be beaming that pipe you know what I'm saying (You know what I mean) 
 Yo them Megas got 'em going up to see Captain Kirk 
 Like a jerk and they outta work 
 Let me tell you a little something, man 
 A lot of people on daytime radio scared of us 
 Because they too ignorant to understand the lyrics of the 
 Truth that we pumping into them clogged up brain cells 
 That just spun their little wooden skulls they call caps 
 You know what I'm saying? 
 But the S1s'll straighten it out quick fast in a hurry 
 Don't worry, Flavor vision ain't blurry, you know what I'm saying? 
 Yo, Terminator X

 Casket cover clips, dead women hips you do the bump with -- bones 
 Nuttin' but love bones

 Honey drippers, you say you got it 
 You ain't got no flava, and I can prove it

 I think ya hungry 'cause ya starvin' for flava 
 Flavor most, put it on your toast 
 Eat it and taste it and swallow it down 
 Imperial flavor gives you the crown 
 Of the king called Flava, the king of all flavors 
 Rolls and rolls and rolls of Life Savers 
 Flavor Flav is in everything you eat 
 'Cause everythin' ya eat got flava 
 Flavor Flav is the first taste you get in the mornin'

 I stand accused of doing harm

 I say it once again 
 I'm called the enemy - I'll never be a friend 
 Of those with closed minds, don't know I'm rapid

 Am I buggin' 'cause they're buggin' my phone - for information 
 No tellin' who's sellin' out - power buildin' the nation so... 
 Joinin' the set, the point blank target 
 Every brothers inside - so least not, you forget, no 
 Takin' the blame is not a waste, here taste 
 A bit of the song so you can never be wrong 
 Just a bit of advice, 'cause we be payin' the price 
 'Cause every brother man's life 
 Is like swingin' the dice, right? 
 Here it is, once again this is 
 The brother to brother 
 The Terminator, the cutter 
 Goin' on an' on - leave alone the grown 
 Get it straight in '88, an' I'll troop it to demonstrate 
 The posse always ready - 98 at 98 
 My posse come quick, because my posse got velocity 
 Tappin' my phone, they never leave me alone 
 I'm even lethal when I'm unarmed 
 'Cause I'm louder than a bomb 
 'Cause the D is for dangerous 
 You can come and get some of this 
 I teach and speak 
 So when its spoke, it's no joke

 The place shakes with bass 
 Called one for the treble

 Here's a funky rhyme that they're tappin' on

 Won't be on a playlist 
 Bust the way that I say this: No Sell Out

20,Public Enemy,hiphop,She Watch Channel Zero?!,"Flavor Flav: 
 You're blind baby you're blind from the facts on who you are 
 'Cause you're watchin' that garbage. 
 The woman makes the men all pause 
 And if you got a woman 
 She might make you forget yours 
 There's a 5 letter word 
 To describe her character 
 But her brains being washed by an actor 
 And every real man that tries to approach 
 Come the closer he comes 
 He gets dissed like a roach 
 I don't think I can handle 
 She goes channel to channel 
 Cold lookin' for that hero 
 She watch channel zero 
 She watch, She watch [4x] 
 [Flavor Flav:] Yo baby, you got to cut that garbage off. Yo! I wanna watch 
 The game. {Where's your doin'} Hey yo, lemme tell you a little som'in: I'm 
 'A take all your soaps, an' then I'm gonna hang 'em on a rope. You know what 
 I'm sayin'? 'Cause that garbage your watchin' don't make no sense. Hey yo, 
 Lemme tell you a little som'in baby: I'm 'a take your set an' I'm 'a throw it 
 Out the window. G's. 
 2, 7, 5, 4, 8 she watched she said 
 All added up to zero 
 And nothing in her head 
 She turns and turns 
 And she hopes the soaps 
 Are for real - she learns 
 That it ain't true, nope 
 But she won't survive 
 And rather die in a lie 
 Falls a fool - for some dude - on a tube 
 (Refrain, chorus) 
 [Flavor Flav:] Yo baby, you think I'm jokin'? Do it look like I'm jokin'? I 
 Ain't jokin', word up, baby. Yo, cut that garbage off now. Yo, I got the 
 Tyson fight on, you know what I'm sayin'? Yo, so you can't be comin' in here 
 Stackin' {aid} like that, you know what I'm sayin'? Yo, we gettin' ready to 
 Watch the Super Bowl, we got a black quarterback so step back. 
 Trouble vision for a sister 
 'Cause I know she don't know, I quote 
 Her brains retrained 
 By a 24 inch remote 
 Revolution a solution 
 For all of our children 
 But her children 
 Don't mean as much as the show, I mean 
 Watch her worship the screen, and fiend 
 For a TV ad 
 And it just makes me mad 
 (Refrain, chorus) 
 [Flavor Flav:] Yo baby, can't you that's nonsense you watchin'? Look, don't 
 Nobody look like that, nobody even live that, you know what I'm sayin'? You 
 Watchin' garbage, not'in' but garbage. Straight up garbage. Yo, why don't 
 You just back up from the TV, read a book or som'in. Read about yourself,

 Bammm 
 And you say, Goddamn 
 This is the dope jam 
 But lets define the term called dope 
 And you think it mean funky now, no 
 Here is a true tale 
 Of the ones that deal 
 Are the ones that fail 
 Yeah 
 You can move if you wanna move 
 What it prove 
 It's here like the groove 
 The problem is this - we gotta' fix it 
 Check out the justice - and how they run it 
 Sellin', smellin' 
 Sniffin', riffin' 
 And brothers try to get swift an' 
 Sell to their own, rob a home 
 While some shrivel to bone 
 Like comatose walkin' around 
 Please don't confuse this with the sound 
 I'm talking about... BASS 
 I put this together to... 
 Rock the bells of those that 
 Boost the dose 
 Of lack a lack 
 And those that sell to Black 
 Shame on a brother when he dealin' 
 The same block where my 98 be wheelin' 
 And everybody know 
 Another kilo 
 From a corner from a brother to keep another - 
 Below 
 Stop illin' and killin' 
 Stop grillin' 
 Yo, black, yo (we are willin') 
 4, 5 o'clock in the mornin' 
 Wait a minute y'all

 Day to day they say no other way

 Yo, listen 
 I see it on their faces

 Standin' in line 
 Checkin' the time 
 Homeboys playin' the curb

 Now they're gone 
 Passin' it on 
 Poison attack - the Black word bond 
 Daddy-O 
 Once said to me 
 He knew a brother who stayed all day in his jeep 
 And at night he went to sleep 
 And in the mornin' all he had was 
 The sneakers on his feet 
 The culprit used to jam and rock the mike, yo 
 He stripped the jeep to fill his pipe 
 And wander around to find a place 
 Where they rocked to a different kind of... BASS"
22,Public Enemy,hiphop,Black Steel In The Hour Of Chaos,"I got a letter from the government 
 The other day 
 I opened and read it 
 It said they were suckers 
 They wanted me for their army or whatever 
 Picture me given' a damn - I said never 
 Here is a land that never gave a damn 
 About a brother like me and myself 
 Because they never did 
 I wasn't wit' it, but just that very minute... 
 It occurred to me 
 The suckers had authority 
 Cold sweatin' as I dwell in my cell 
 How long has it been? 
 They got me sittin' in the state pen 
 I gotta get out - but that thought was thought before 
 I contemplated a plan on the cell floor 
 I'm not a fugitive on the run 
 But a brother like me begun - to be another one 
 Public enemy servin' time - they drew the line y'all 
 To criticize me some crime - never the less 
 They could not understand that I'm a Black man 
 And I could never be a veteran 
 On the strength, the situation's unreal 
 I got a raw deal, so I'm goin' for the steel 
 They got me rottin' in the time that I'm servin' 
 Tellin' you what happened the same time they're throwin' 
 4 of us packed in a cell like slaves - oh well 
 The same motherfucker got us livin' is his hell 
 You have to realize - what it's a form of slavery 
 Organized under a swarm of devils 
 Straight up - word'em up on the level 
 The reasons are several, most of them federal 
 Here is my plan anyway and I say 
 I got gusto, but only some I can trust - yo 
 Some do a bid from 1 to 10 
 And I never did, and plus I never been 
 I'm on a tier where no tears should ever fall 
 Cell block and locked - I never clock it y'all 
 'Cause time and time again time 
 They got me servin' to those and to them 
 I'm not a citizen 
 But ever when I catch a C-O 
 Sleepin' on the job - my plan is on go-ahead 
 On the strength, I'ma tell you the deal 
 I got nothin' to lose 
 'Cause I'm goin' for the steel 
 You know I caught a C-O 
 Fallin' asleep on death row 
 I grabbed his gun - then he did what I said so 
 And everyman's got served 
 Along with the time they served 
 Decency was deserved 
 To understand my demands 
 I gave a warnin' - I wanted the governor, y'all 
 And plus the warden to know 
 That I was innocent - 
 Because I'm militant 
 Posing a threat, you bet it's fuckin' up the government 
 My plan said I had to get out and break north 
 Just like with Oliver's neck 
 I had to get off - my boys had the feds in check 
 They couldn't do nothin' 
 We had a force to instigate a prison riot 
 This is what it takes for peace 
 So I just took the piece 
 Black for Black inside time to cut the leash 
 Freedom to get out - to the ghetto - no sell out 
 6 C-Os we got we ought to put their head out 
 But I'll give 'em a chance, 'cause I'm civilized 
 As for the rest of the world, they can't realize 
 A cell is hell - I'm a rebel so I rebel 
 Between bars, got me thinkin' like an animal 
 Got a woman C-O to call me a copter 
 She tried to get away, and I popped her 
 Twice, right 
 Now who wanna get nice? 
 I had 6 C-Os, now it's 5 to go 
 And I'm serious - call me delirious 
 But I'm still a captive 
 I gotta rap this 
 Time to break as time grows intense 
 I got the steel in my right hand 
 Now I'm lookin' for the fence 
 I ventured into the courtyard 
 Followed by 52 brothers 
 Bruised, battered, and scarred but hard 
 Goin' out with a bang 
 Ready to bang out 
 But power from the sky 
 And from the tower shots rang out 
 A high number of dose - yes 
 And some came close 
 Figure I trigger my steel 
 Stand and hold my post 
 This is what I mean - an anti-nigger machine 
 If I come out alive and then they won't - come clean 
 And then I threw up my steel bullets - flew up 
 Blew up, who shot... 
 What, who, the bazooka was who 
 And to my rescue, it was the S1Ws 
 Secured my getaway, so I just gotaway 
 The joint broke, from the black smoke 
 Then they saw it was rougher thatn the average bluffer 
 'Cause the steel was black, the attitude exact 
 Now the chase is on tellin' you to c'mon 
 53 brothers on the run, and we are gone"

 They praised the music - this time they play the lyrics 
 Some say no to the album, the show 
 Bum rush the sound I made a year ago 
 I guess you know - you guess I'm just a radical 
 Not a sabbatical - yes to make it critical 
 The only part your body should be parting to 
 Panther power on the hour from the rebel to you 
 Radio - suckers never play me 
 On the mix - just O.K. me 
 Now known and grown when they're clocking my zone it's known 
 Snakin' and takin' everything that a brother owns 
 Hard - my calling card 
 Recorded and orderd - supporter of Chesimard 
 Loud and proud kickin' live next poet supreme 
 Loop a troop, bazooka, the scheme 
 Flavor - a rebel in his own mind 
 Supporter of my rhyme 
 Designed to scatter a line of suckers who claim I do crime

 That's the reason they're claimin' that I'm violent 
 Never silent - no dope gettin' dumb nope 
 Claimin' where we get our rhythm from 
 Number one - we hit ya and we give ya some 
 No gun - and still never on the run 
 You wanna be an S.1 - Griff will tell you when 
 And then you'll come - you'll know what time it is 
 Impeach the president - pullin' out the ray-gun 
 Zap the next one - I could be you're Sho-gun 
 Suckers - don't last a minute 
 Soft and smooth - I ain't with it 
 Hardcore - rawbone like a razor 
 I'm like a lazer - I just won't graze ya 
 Old enough to raise ya - so this will faze ya 
 Get it right boy and maybe I will praise ya 
 Playin' the role I got soul too 
 Voice my opinion with volume 
 Smooth - no what I am 
 Rough - 'cause I'm the man 
 No matter what the name - we're all the same 
 Pieces in one big chess game 
 Yeah - the voice of power 
 Is in the house - go take a shower boy 
 P.E. a group, a crew - not singular 
 We were black Wranglers 
 We're rap stranglers 
 You can't angle us - I know you're listenin' 
 I caught you pissin' in you're pants 
 You're scared of us dissin' us 
 The crowd is missin' us 
 We're on a mission boy 
 Terminator X 
 Attitude - when I'm on fire 
 Juice on the loose - electric wire 
 Simple and plain - give me the lane 
 I'll throw it down your throat like Barkley 
 See the car keys - you'll never get these 
 They belong to the 98 posse 
 You want some more son - you wanna get some 
 Rush the door on a store - pick up the album

 Bring the noise - my time 
 Step aside for the flex - Terminator X"

 Or harmonize it through Go-Go

 But God made it affordable 
 I say it, you play it

 Describes my scenario 
 Left or right, Black or White 
 They tell lies in the books 
 That you're readin' 
 It's knowledge of yourself 
 That you're needin' 
 Like Vescey or Prosser 
 We have a reason why 
 To debate the hate 
 That's why we're born to die

 Pumpin' what you're used to 
 Until the whole juice crew 
 Gets me in my goose down

 And the sellers a dweller in a cage

 And we're out to get it

 This party started right in 66 
 With a pro-Black radical mix 
 Then at the hour of twelve 
 Some force cut the power 
 And emerged from hell 
 It was your so called government 
 That made this occur 
 Like the grafted devils they were 
 J. Edgar Hoover, and he coulda proved to you 
 He had King and X set up 
 Also the party with Newton, Cleaver and Seale 
 He ended, so get up 
 Time to get 'em back

 Get back on the track

 Word from the honorable Elijah Muhammed 
 Know who you are to be Black 
 To those that disagree it causes static 
 For the original Black Asiatic man 
 Cream of the earth 
 And was here first 
 And some devils prevent this from being known 
 But you check out the books they own 
 Even masons they know it 
 But refuse to show it, yo

 How to get it on, it's quite simple

 We need a piece of this rock 
 Our goal indestructible soul 
 Answers to this quizzin' 
 To the Brothers in the streetSchools and the prisons

 They're super bad 
 Small chance a smart brother's 
 Gonna be a victim of his own circumstance 
 Sabotaged, Shellshocked, rocked and ruled 
 Day in the life of a fool 
 Like I said before to live it low 
 Life take you time, time yo go slow

 Teach a man how to be father 
 To never tell a woman he can't bother

 Now I'm ready to mike it 
 (You know I like it) huh 
 Hear my favoritism roll ""Oh"" 
 Never be a brother like to go solo 
 Lazer, anastasia, maze ya 
 Ways to blaze your brain and train ya 
 The way I'm livin', forgiven' 
 What I'm givin' up 
 X on the flex hit me now 
 I don't know about later 
 As for now I know how to avoid the paranoid 
 Man I've had it up to here 
 Gear I wear got 'em goin' in fear 
 Rhetoric said 
 Read just a bit ago 
 Not quittin' though 
 Signed the hard rhymer 
 Work to keep from gettin' jerked 
 Changin' some ways 
 To way back in the better days 
 Raw metaphysically bold 
 Never followed a code 
 Still dropped a load 
 Never question what I am God knows 
 'Cause it's comin' from the heart 
 What I got better get some 
 (Get on up) hustler of culture 
 Snakebitten 
 Been spit in the face 
 But the rhymes keep fittin' 
 Respects been givin' how's ya livin' 
 Now I can't protect a pad off defect 
 Check the record 
 An reckon an intentional wreck 
 Played off as some intellect 
 Made the call, took the fall 
 Broke the laws 
 Not my fault they're fallin' off 
 Known as fair square 
 Throughout my years 
 So I growl at the livin' foul 
 Black to the bone my home is your home 
 So welcome to the Terrordome 
 Subordinate terror 
 Kickin' off an era 
 Cold deliverin' pain 
 My 98 was 87 on a record yo 
 So now I go Bronco 
 Crucifixion ain't no fiction 
 So called chosen frozen 
 Apology made to who ever pleases 
 Still they got me like Jesus 
 I rather sing, bring, think reminisce 
 'Bout a brother while I'm in sync 
 Every brother ain't a brother cause a color 
 Just as well could be undercover 
 Backstabbed, grabbed a flag 
 From the back of the lab 
 Told a Rab get off the rag 
 Sad to say I got sold down the river 
 Still some quiver when I deliver 
 Never to say I never know or had a clue 
 Word was heard, plus hard on the boulevard 
 Lies, scandalizin', basin' 
 Traits of hate who's celebratin' wit Satan? 
 I rope a dope the evil with righteous 
 Bobbin' and weavin' and let the good get even 
 C'mon down 
 And welcome to the Terrordome. 
 Caught in the race against time 
 The pit and the pendulum 
 Check the rhythm and rhymes 
 While I'm bendin' 'em 
 Snakes blowin' up the lines of design 
 Tryin' to blind the science I'm snedin' 'em 
 How to fight the power 
 Cannot run and hide 
 But it shouldn't be suicide 
 In a game a fool without the rules 
 Got a hell of a nerve to just criticize 
 Every brother ain't a brother 
 Cause a Black hand 
 Squeezed on Malcolm X the man 
 The shootin' of Huey Newton 
 From a hand of a Nigger who pulled the trigger 
 It's weak to speak and blame somebody else 
 When you destroy yourself 
 First nothing's worse than a mother's pain 
 Of a son slain in Bensonhurst 
 Can't wait for the state to decide the fate 
 So this jam I dedicate 
 Places with racist faces 
 Just an example of one of many cases 
 The Greek weekend speech I speak 
 From a lesson learned in Virginia (Beach) 
 I don't smile in the line of fire 
 I go wildin' 
 But it's on bass and drums even violins 
 Watcha do gitcha head ready 
 Instead of gettin' physically sweaty 
 When I get mad 
 I put it down on a pad 
 Give ya somethin' that cha never had controllin' 
 Fear of high rollin' 
 God bless your soul and keep livin' 
 Never allowed, kickin' it loud 
 Droppin' a bomb 
 Brain game intellectual Vietnam 
 Move as a team 
 Never move alone 
 But 
 Welcome to the Terrordome"

 He don't believe he has it

32,Public Enemy,hiphop,Pollywanacraka,"She wants a lover right now 
 But not no brother 
 Her man gotta have a lotta money 
 To get under her cover 
 Now she's a fine sister 
 But up here she's missin' it 
 She says she wanna learn about life 
 No old black bull shit 
 At the age of 15 a brother gave her a baby 
 She's 19 now and it drover her crazy 
 And now every time 
 She turns around 
 All the people in the neighborhood 
 Look and get mad and sing 
 Meet Mr. Succesful 
 I guess he's blessed yeah 
 But he happens to be a brother 
 Who only wants blue eyes and blonde hair 
 Now this young mister 
 He don't like sisters 
 He couldn't find that special one 
 He know why he missed her 
 He says sisters wasn't good enuff 
 They only wanted his green stuff 
 That's why every time he turned 
 Around all the people 
 In the neighborhood 
 Looked and got mad 
 And sang 
 I try to tell my people 
 There should not be any hatred 
 For a brother or a sister 
 Whose opposite race they've mated 
 No man is God 
 And God put us all here (yeah) 
 But this system has no wisdom 
 The devil split us in pairs 
 And taught us White is good, Black is bad 
 And Black and White is still too bad 
 That's why every time I turn around 
 All the people in my neighborhood 
 Look mad and sing..."
33,Public Enemy,hiphop,Anti-Nigger Machine,"When I'm talkin' rhyme time

 It's nothing worse than a verse 
 To hear some nigger curse 
 They call me rude some dudes fiery attitude 
 Claimin' I boast and smoke 
 And sometimes sing the blues 
 I twang metal and settle 
 Try to never back pedal 
 From the power some got 
 To get a nigger shot 
 The null and void I avoid 
 I test the paranoid 
 Never had to be bad 
 My mama raised me mad 
 So what I got is hot 
 I love my life a lot 
 I'm never sad just glad 
 That's why I thank my dad 
 Once they never gave a fuck about 
 What I said 
 Now they listen and they want my head 
 Instead of peace the police 
 Just wanna wreck and flex 
 On the kid 
 What I did was try to be the best 
 So they fingered the trigger 
 Figured I was a bigger nigger 
 And started to search 
 An so I headed west 
 Went to cally a rally 
 Was for a brothers death 
 It was the fuzz who shot him 
 An not da blood or cuzz 
 I wondered why it was like 
 So I just held my mike 
 But in my mind I was blind 
 So I just tried to find 
 A reason we was quick 
 Just the way that we was 
 So I just stayed in the crib 
 Until I got a buzz..."

 Burn Hollywood burn I smell a riot 
 Goin' on first they're guilty now they're gone 
 Yeah I'll check out a movie 
 But it'll take a Black one to move me 
 Get me the hell away from this TV 
 All this news and views are beneath me 
 Cause all I hear about is shots ringin' out 
 So I rather kick some slang out 
 All right fellas let's go hang out 
 Hollywood or would they not 
 Make us all look bad like I know they had 
 But some things I'll never forget yeah 
 So step and fetch this shit 
 For all the years we looked like clowns 
 The joke is over smell the smoke from all around 
 Burn Hollywood burn 
 Ice cube: 
 Ice Cube is down with the PE 
 Now every single bitch wanna see me 
 Big Daddy is smooth word to muther 
 Let's check out a flick that exploits the color 
 Roamin' through Hollywood late at night 
 Red and blue lights what a common sight 
 Pulled to the curb gettin' played like a sucker 
 Don't fight the power ... the mother fucker 
 Big daddy kane: 
 As I walk the streets of Hollywood Boulevard 
 Thinin' how hard it was to those that starred 
 In the movies portrayin' the roles 
 Of butlers and maids slaves and hoes 
 Many intelligent Black men seemed to look uncivilized 
 When on the screen 
 Like a guess I figure you to play some jigaboo 
 On the plantation, what else can a nigger do 
 And Black women in this profession 
 As for playin' a lawyer, out of the question 
 For what they play Aunt Jemima is the perfect term 
 Even if now she got a perm 
 So let's make our own movies like Spike Lee 
 Cause the roles being offered don't strike me 
 There's nothing that the Black man could use to earn

36,Public Enemy,hiphop,Who Stole The Soul?,"Once again, this is it 
 Turn it up 
 Here we go 
 But this time the rhyme 
 Gonna ask who did the crime 
 Then let's get down to the nitty-gritty 
 Like I wanna know who 
 Picked Wilson's pocket 
 Afth, he rocket it 
 Fact, he shocked it 
 Same kinna thing they threw at James 
 An what did to Redd was a shame 
 The bigger the Black get 
 The bigger the feds want 
 A piece of that ... booty 
 Intentional rape system, like we ain't 
 Payed enough in this bitch, that's why I dissed them 
 I learned we earned, got no concern 
 Instead we burned so where the hell is our return? 
 Plain and simp the system's a pimp 
 But I refuse to be a ho 
 Who stole the soul? 
 Ain't, no, different 
 Than in South Africa 
 Over here they'll go after ya to steal your soul 
 Like over there they stole our gold 
 Yo they say the Black don't know how to act 
 'Cause we're waitin' for the big payback 
 But we know it'll never come 
 That's why I say come and get some 
 Why when the Black move it, Jack move out 
 Come to stay Jack moves away 
 Ain't we all people? 
 How the hell can a color be no good for a neighborhood 
 Help, straighten me out 
 'Cause my tribe gets a funny vibe 
 They I'm wrong for singin' a song 
 Without solutions 
 All the dancers answer questions 
 And try to be the best and... 
 Let everybody know before I blow 
 For the sake of what's right 
 I wanna know who stole the soul? 
 We choose to use their ways 
 And holidays notice some of them are heller days 
 Invented by those who never repented 
 For the sins within that killed my kin 
 But that's all right 
 I try do what a brother does 
 But I'll never know if you're my 'cause 
 That's why I try my best to unite 
 And damn the rest if they don't like it 
 Banned from many arenas 
 Word from the motherland 
 Has anybody seen her 
 Jack was nimble, Jack was quick 
 Got a question for Jack ask him 
 40 acres and a mule Jack 
 Where is it why'd you try to fool the Black 
 It wasn't you, but you pledge allegiance 
 To the red, white, and blue 
 Sucker that stole the soul!"

 Worry 'bout a thing 
 'Bout your daughter

 We're livin' in a land where 
 The law say the mixing of race 
 Makes the blood impure 
 She's a woman I'm a man

 See ya can't stand it 
 Man calm your ass down, don't get mad 
 I don't your sistah

 Or would you dismiss her

 Is it European state of being, I'm not sure 
 If the whole world was to come 
 Through peace and love 
 Then what would we made of? 
 Excuse us for the news 
 You might not be amused 
 But did you know white comes from Black 
 No need to be confused 
 Excuse us for the news 
 I question those accused 
 Why is this fear of Black from White 
 Influence who you choose? 
 Man c'mon now, I don't want your wife 
 Stop screamin' it's not the end of your life

 What's wrong with some color in your family tree 
 I don't know 
 I'm just a rhyme sayer 
 Skins protected 'gainst the ozone layers 
 Breakdown 2001 
 Might be best to be Black 
 Or just Brown countdown 
 I've been wonderin' why 
 People livin' in fear 
 Of my shade 
 (Or my hi top fade) 
 I'm not the one that's runnin' 
 But they got me one the run 
 Treat me like I have a gun 
 All I got is genes and chromosomes 
 Consider me Black to the bone 
 All I want is peace and love 
 On this planet 
 (Ain't that how God planned it?) 
 Excuse us for the news 
 You might not be amused

 Just a matter of race 
 Cause a black male's in their face 
 Step back for the new jack (swing!) 
 On the platter scatter huh 
 We got our own thing 
 Just jam to let the rhythm run 
 Day to day, America eats it's young 
 And defeats our women 
 There is a gap so wide we all can swim in 
 Drown in (uh! get down) an get it 
 Got it goin' on wit it 
 Sister (hey!) soul sister 
 We goin' be all right 
 It takes a man to take a stand 
 Understand it takes a 
 Woman to make a stronger man 
 As we both get strong 
 They'll call me a crazy Asiatic 
 While I'm singin' a song 
 Oh my god, oh my lord 
 I can't hold back 
 So I get exact on a track 
 It's an eye for eye, tooth for tooth 
 Forget about me 
 Just set my sister free 
 R-e-s-p-e-c-t, my sisters not my enemy 
 'Cause we'll be stronger together 
 And make 'em all say 
 (Damn!) this generation 
 They don't know what we got goin' is (sound) 
 To turn it all around 
 To my sisters I communicate 
 With the bass and tone 
 Through speakers and a microphone 
 'Cause I'm tired of America dissin' my sisters 
 For example like they dissed Tawana 
 And they try to say she's a liar 
 My people don't believe it 
 But even now they're getting higher 
 Of the feeling inspiration 
 We must know that in this nation 
 Every single generation 
 They teach us how to dis our sisters 
 Stange as you say, I say revolution 
 Need for change brings on revolution 
 The great book look see solution 
 God chooses what and who for the bruisin' 
 There's been no justice for none of my sisters 
 Just us been the ones that's been missin' her 
 Now we got to protect 
 And get together and (damn) this generation 
 I said so to what it is 
 Where it is 
 She needs a little respect 
 There it is 
 I would say she needs a lotta 
 Brother from a mother like me has gotta 
 Give it up 
 Give it now 
 And pass it all around 
 To my soul sister! 
 They disrespected mama and treated her like dirt 
 America took her, reshaped her, raped her 
 No it never made the paper 
 Beat us, mated us 
 Made us attack our woman in black 
 So I said sophisticated B (don't be one!) 
 Not to heed the warning crack of dawn 
 Or is it the dawn of crack? (uh oh!) 
 Stop the talk they say, but 
 We talk and say what's right or wrong 
 Some say we wasting time singing a song 
 But why is it there were many different shades? 
 Black woman's privacy invaded years and years 
 You cannot count my mama's tears 
 It's not the past, the future's what she fears 
 Strong we be strong 
 The next generation 
 It's not what/who we're facin' 
 The finger's pointed to us in our direction 
 The blind state of mind needs correction 
 Word to the mother we tighten connection 
 To be a man you need no election 
 This generation generates a new attitude 
 Sister to you we should not be rude 
 So we come together 
 And make 'em all say

 And you search the stores 
 Attack the racks with your claws 
 For the rebels without a pause

 Wins again, again, again 
 Yo Black, some of you are all in 
 To make sure the crowd 
 Get loud wit' it on the dance floor

 To start a riot, we ain't quiet 
 Kickin' a thunderstorm with a song 
 Why would we dare you to come along 
 Pump up the music, pump the sound

 And any other nigger wit an attitude see 
 And any other rapper whose a brother 
 Who try to speak to one another

 I rather do it at 45 
 Went west in the quest for my intelligence 
 Climbed a fence took a teacher on 
 Ain't seen him since, hence he winced 
 And convinced that the Black 
 Was back revolving to a renaissance 
 Bronze to gold I told felt bold 
 Taught a so called teacher our role 
 In civilizin' the whole globe 
 Banned unplanned as I said 
 I don't break down religion why? 
 There ain't a smidgen for a pigeon 
 Nature for bird, dog, worm or lion 
 So my question to man is 
 So why the lyin' 
 God's law I saw is natural factual 
 Only man creates a waste 
 Defiance in his haste 
 Based on scheme a scam 
 From some mastermind damn if we read it 
 And we see it and still be blind

 Lookin' all around at my so called friend 
 Light skin to the brown 
 The black 
 Here we go again 
 Homey over there knows Keith an 
 But he be thiefin' 
 I don't trust him 
 Rather bust 'em 
 Up out goes his hand and I cough 
 He once stole from me 
 Yeah I wanna cut it off 
 The black thing is a ride I call the nighttrain 
 It rides the good and the bad 
 We call the monkey trained 
 Trained to attack the black it's true 
 'Cause some of them look just like you 
 Stayin' on the scene 
 Sittin' on the train 
 See all the faces 
 Look about the same 
 There go the sellout who's takin' a ride like Cargo 
 'Cause he deal 
 The keys from Key Largo 
 Runnin' Nat narcotic 
 By George he got it 
 Takin' makin' the G erotic 
 And the fiends they scheme 
 So he can put 'em down 
 But his method is wreck 'em 
 Put 'em in tha ground 
 Got tha nerve as hell 
 To yell brother man 
 He ain't black man 
 Known to murder his own 
 Traitor on the phone 
 Ridin' the train 
 Self-hater trained 
 To sell pain 
 The master's toy 
 Little boy 
 Hard to avoid he look wit' it but he null 'n' void 
 'Cause he ridin' the train you think he down for the cause 
 'Cause his face looks just like yours 
 More of the same insane who sayin' 
 Like flowin' like nighttrain 
 Runnin' the pain of the black reign 
 You look, you laugh 
 You doubt and go out 
 And I'm gone 
 But the bass goes on 
 To talk the talk, but walk the walk 
 The king of New York 
 Crack a lack attack the black 
 To crack the back 
 Once again I test a friend wit' sincerity 
 Or consider him an enemy 
 Who am I to tell a lie 
 Rather push da bush 
 Hope da cracker get crushed 
 I'm rollin' wit' rush 
 Leader of the bum rush 
 Russian I ain't 
 Spreadin' like paint 
 Lookin' at the put I got 
 And its kickin' 
 But it ain't chicken 
 But it's livin' for a city 
 So sick 'n' tired 
 Of a scene buckwild, piled in a file 
 Senile or chile 
 They said it never been no worser 
 Than this, I'm on the nighttrain 
 They hope ya don't miss it 
 Give ya what dey gotta give you just go 
 You musn't just put your 
 Trust in every brother yo 
 Some don't give a damn 
 'Cause they the other man 
 Worse than a bomb 
 Posin' as Uncle Toms 
 Disgracin' the race 
 Blowin' up 
 The whole crew 
 Wit' some of them lookin' 
 Just like you"

 Not an eight track 
 Gettin' it good to the wood 
 So the people give you some a dat 
 Reactin' to the fax 
 That I kick and it stick 
 And it stay around 
 Pointin' to the joint 
 Put the Buddha down 
 Goin', goin', gettin' to the roots 
 Ain't givin' it up 
 So turn me loose 
 But then again I got a story 
 That's harder than the hardcore 
 Cost of the holocaust 
 I'm talkin' 'bout the one still goin' on 
 I know where I'm from 
 Not dum diddie dum 
 From the base motherland 
 The place of the drum 
 Invaded by the wack diddie wack 
 Fooled the black, left us faded 
 King and chief probably had a big beef 
 Because of dat now I grit my teeth 
 So here's a song to the strong 
 'Bout a shake of a snake 
 And the smile went along wit dat 
 Can't truss it 
 Can't truss it (no no no no) 
 Can't truss it (no no no no) 
 Can't truss it (no no no no) 
 Can't truss it (here I go) 
 Kickin' wicked rhymes 
 Like a fortune teller 
 'Cause the wickedness done by Jack 
 Where everybody at 
 Divided and sold 
 For the liquor and the gold 
 Smacked in the back 
 For the other man to mack 
 Now the story that I'm kickin' is gory 
 Little Rock where they be 
 Dockin' this boat 
 No hope I'm shackled 
 Plus gang tackled 
 By the other hand swingin' the rope 
 Wearin' red, white and blue 
 Jack and his crew 
 The guy's authorized beat down for the brown 
 Man to the man 
 Each one so it teach one 
 Born to terrorize sisters and every brother 
 One love who said it 
 I know Whodini sang it 
 But the hater taught hate 
 That's why we gang bang it 
 Beware of the hand 
 When it's comin' from the left 
 I ain't trippin' just watch ya step 
 Can't truss it 
 Can't truss it (no no no no) 
 Can't truss it (no no no no) 
 Can't truss it (no no no no) 
 Can't truss it (here come the drums) 
 Can't truss it 
 Can't truss it 
 Can't truss it 
 Can't truss it 
 An I judge everyone, one by the one 
 Look here come the judge 
 Watch it here he come now 
 I can only guess what's happ'nin' 
 Years ago he woulda been the ships captain 
 Gettin' me bruised on a cruise 
 What I got to lose 
 Lost all contact 
 Got me layin' on my back 
 Rollin' in my own leftover 
 When I roll over, I roll over on somebody else 
 Ninety damn days on a slave ship 
 Count 'em fallin' off 
 1, 2, 3, 4 hun'ed at a time 
 Blood in the wood and it's mine 
 I'm chokin' on spit feelin' pain 
 Like my brain bein' chained 
 Still gotta give it what I got 
 But it's hot in the day 
 It's cold in the night 
 But I thrive to survive 
 I pray to god to stay alive 
 My attitude boils inside 
 And that ain't it 
 You think I'll ever quit? 
 Still I pray to get my hands around 
 The neck of the man wit' the whip 
 Three months pass, they brand a label on my ass 
 To signify owned 
 I'm on the microphone 
 Sayin' 1555 
 How I'm livin' 
 We been livin' here 
 Livin' ain't the word 
 I been givin' 
 Haven't got 
 Classify us in the have-nots 
 Fightin' haves 
 'Cause it's all about money 
 When it comes to Armageddon 
 Mean I'm getting mine 
 Here I am turn it over Sam 
 427 to the year 
 Do you understand 
 That's why it's hard 
 For the black to love the land 
 Once again 
 Bass in your face 
 Not an eight track 
 Gettin' it good to the wood 
 So the people give you some a dat 
 Reactin' to the fax

48,Public Enemy,hiphop,How To Kill A Radio Consultant,"Pusher of the button 
 Talkin' loud ain't sayin' nuttin' 
 The mack of the format gettin' fat 
 Ain't funny 'cause my neighborhood 
 Is flowin' money 
 Thank God 4 the boulevard 
 They keep the motor runnin' 
 The rap shows coincide wit' the tape flow 
 Bootleggers go inside and record the record low 
 They get me, get this now can you freestyle 
 Freestyle no styles free except da radio 
 But the radio controlled by the sucker move 
 Who moved away got away after plannin' a getaway 
 An now he wanna play what he wanna play 
 An got say on what is bumpin' of course he's gettin' somethin' 
 Never know what's good to tha neighborhood 
 Swear I never seen da sucker 
 In my necka da woods 
 The ass is connected to the brain stem 
 So I sing a simple song 
 So you can see the sucker in 'em 
 People got to make a call 
 To hear the yes y'all (yes y'all) 
 While the phone keep ringin' 
 You hear some singer singin' 
 Why don't dey play the jammy in the daytime 
 People think it's slammin' plus the rhyme 
 Is hot an got me tunin' 
 The afternoon is FM in the PM 
 Oh if that they could see 'im 
 Out-of-towner not down I think they'll dis him 
 Up goes the season, pop goes the weasel 
 Damn gimme rap no band I want some x-clan 
 I know dey even got it from the giddy 
 Stacked in the back 
 Only black radio station in the city 
 Programmed by a sucker in a suit 
 Slick back hair he don't even live here 
 Raps the number one pick so I draft it 
 I don't care about all the other demographics 
 When the quiet storm come on I fall sleep 
 What dey need is Arbitron on the funky jeep 
 Too bad it's goin' on in fact my word is bond 
 To pull a disappearin' act attack until he gone 
 The whacker jam he play they pay I'm in da day 
 I don't think we gonna miss 'im we don't need 'im anyway 
 Can I kick it 
 Who the hell is on the radio 
 Or who's behind 
 Do you really think they'll mind 
 To play the funky jams 
 That everybody wit' 
 Some Def Jef or Ice T 
 Show they rollin' wit' the syndicate 
 Or can dey get funky 
 Wit' the underground 
 Master ace get a taste 
 Bomb squad gettin' hard 
 Marley mart makin' hipper 
 Trax for Jack The Ripper 
 Pumpin' Eric B or Papa San 
 Still rollin' wit' run 
 Did you think that ever 
 In fact you thought that never 
 Control of your soul 
 Is by a suit and tie 
 Then you wonder why why you never hear a rhyme 
 I say we do 'im 
 Till it's done"
49,Public Enemy,hiphop,By The Time I Get To Arizona,"I'm countin' down to the day deservin' fittin' for a King 
 I'm waitin' for the time when I can get to Arizona 
 'Cause my money's spent on the goddamn rent 
 Neither party is mine not the jackass or the elephant 
 20.000 niggy niggy brothas in the corner 
 Of the cell block but they come from California 
 Population is none in the desert and sun 
 Wit' a gun cracker runnin' things under his thumb 
 Starin' hard at the postcards isn't it odd and unique? 
 Seein' people smile wild in the heat 
 120 degree 'cause I wanna be free 
 What's a smilin' face when the whole state's racist? 
 Why want a holiday? damn it 'cause I wanna 
 So what if I celebrate it standin' on a corner 
 I ain't drinkin' no 40 thinkin' time wit' a nine 
 Until we get some land call me the trigger man 
 Lookin' for the governor huh he ain't lovin' ya hah 
 But here to trouble ya he's rubbin' ya wrong 
 Get the point to come along he can get to the joint 
 I urinated on the state while I was kickin' this song 
 Yeah, he appear to be fair You sucker over there 
 He try to keep it yesteryear the good ol' days 
 The same ol' ways that kept us dyin' 
 Yes, You me myself and I indeed 
 What he need is a nosebleed read between the lines 
 Then You see the lie 
 Politically planned don't understand that's all she wrote 
 When we see the real side that hide behind the vote 
 And they can't understand why he the man 
 I'm singin' 'bout a King they don't like it when I decide to mike it 
 Wait I'm waitin' for the date for the man who demands respect 
 'Cause he was great c'mon 
 I'm on the one mission to get a politician to honor 
 Or he's a goner by the time I get to Arizona 
 Well I got 25 days to do it if a wall in the way 
 Just watch me go through it 
 'Cause I gotta do what I gotta do 
 PE number one gets the job done 
 When it's done and over was because I drove 'er 
 Through all the static not stick but automatic 
 That's the way it is he gotta get his 
 Talkin' MLK 
 Gonna find a way 
 Make the state pay lookin' for the day 
 Hard as it seems this ain't no damn dream 
 Gotta know what I mean it's team against team 
 Catch the light beam 
 So I pray I pray everyday I do and praise Jah the maker 
 Lookin' for culture I got but not here from Jamaica 
 Pushin' and shakin' the structure bringin' down the Babylon 
 Hearin' the sucker that make it hard for the brown 
 The hard boulevard I need now more than ever now 
 Who's sittin' on my freedom opressor people beater 
 A piece of the pick we picked a piece of land that we deservin' now 
 Reparation a piece of the nation and damn he got the nerve 
 Another nigga they say and classify we want too much 
 My people plus the nine is mine don't think I even double dutch 
 Here's a brother my attitude is ""hit 'em hang 'em high"" 
 I'm blowin' up the 90s started tickin' in 86 
 When the blind get a mind better start fearin while we sing it now 
 There will be the day we know those down and who will go go go go go... 
 ...By the time I get to Arizona... 
 ...By the time I get to Arizona... 
 ...By the time I get to Arizona..."

 Shorty can't remember what day it was 
 Say I'm yellin' is fact 
 Genocide kickin' in yo back 
 How many times have you seen 
 A black fight a black 
 After drinkin' down a bottle 
 Or a malt liquor six-pack 
 Malt liquor bull 
 What it is is bullshit Colt 
 45 another gun to the brain 
 Who's sellin' us pain 
 In the hood another up to no good 
 Plan that's designed by the other man 
 But who drink it like water 
 One and on till the stores reorder it 
 Brothers cry broke but they still affordin' it 
 Sippin' it lick drink it down oh no 
 Drinkin' poison but they don't know 
 It used to be wine 
 A dollar and a dime 
 Same man, drink in another time 
 They could be hard as hell and don't give a damn 
 But still be a sucker to the liquor man"

 I own loans 
 Suckers got me runnin' from the bank

 Look 'em dead in the eye 
 And they wince 
 Defense is pressurized 
 They don't want it to be 
 Another racial attack 
 In disguise so give some money back

 Money in it

 New York Post right here 
 Come on y'all 
 Get the bost stubost stubost 
 Coasta coasta New York Post 
 Yo New York Post don't brag or boast 
 Dissin' flavor when he's butter that you put on your toast 
 Put my address in the paper 'cause I smacked that girl 
 She's the mother of my kid's that I took around the world 
 Disagreements having scuffles when you share upon 
 You shouldn't try to drain subjects in a duck pond 
 If you're gonna tell a story about people's worries 
 Watch what you tell 'em 'cause they don't bring you glory 
 It only brings agony, ask James Cagney 
 He beat up on a guy when he found he was a fagney 
 Cagney is a favorite he is my boy 
 He don't jive around he's a real McCoy 
 Chuck D yeah, you tellin' Flav we got to let 'em know 
 Here's a letter to the New York Post 
 The worst piece of paper on the east coast 
 Matter of fact the whole state's forty cents 
 In New York City fifty cents elsewhere 
 It makes no goddamn sense at all 
 America's oldest continuously published daily piece of bullshit 
 Flavor Flav is the one that makes The Post money 
 Writers making violence in headlines funny 
 Tryin' to undress my past until it's naked 
 Post got Flavor from sellin' no records 
 Europe Asia to the street of New York 
 Flavor Flav known for his finesse talk 
 Do it to ya for The Post to employ me 
 New York Post can't destroy me 
 Rapper of Public Enemy, rapstar beats lover 
 With the headline of a fucked up cover 
 Out the pot took plate New York Post 
 Get your story straight motherfucker 
 It always seem they make our neighborhood look bad 
 Here's a letter to the New York Post 
 Ain't worth the paper it's printed on 
 Founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton 
 That is 190 years continuous of fucked up news 
 Yo one can play the game, two can play the game 
 Yo Flav read on can't forget you either Jet 
 Flavor Flav is your best Jet yet 
 My own people own the most business 
 Write on faith of value'sness 
 Should have checked with me before you wrote it 
 Got it from another source and quote it 
 Put it out like the new year bull drop 
 In every beauty parlor and barber shop 
 Flavor Flav world renown 
 Can't keep a man like Flavor down 
 Yo Jet be a good host 
 Don't print bull like the New York Post 
 Augh, looks like somebody slipped up here 
 Anyway here's a letter to the New York Post 
 Black newspaper and magazines are supposed to get the real deal 
 From the source y'all 
 Sorry, Jet you took the info straight out of The Post 
 Burned us just like toast 
 When it comes to getting you facts straight about P.E. 
 Get your shit correct"

 I'm straight up and I'm straight 
 So how you like me now 
 But I know how you do 
 You're straight from Babylon 
 But I know how you do 
 You're straight from Babylon 
 They said turn it down 
 'Cause it's a new law 
 You never seen us before 
 But we're raw like a war 
 They warned me once 
 They warned me twice 
 So I knew I was warned 
 They had it goin' on 
 I got the f--- outta Dodge 
 Wit' my Bronco 
 60 miles per hour 
 50 miles to go 
 And I be pumpin' the sound 
 Drownin' out the cars 
 Which tape should I rock 
 L.L.'s or R.A.'s 
 I'm in the streets of New York 
 (Go away) 
 So I pop in my Kool G Rap 'n' Polo tape 
 And they was at it again 
 Sirens in the air 
 Ah sh-t 
 So I'm outta here 
 But the blue in the front 
 Called the blue in the back 
 They cut me off 
 Stopped me dead in my tracks 
 But this is minimal 
 I'm not a criminal 
 I always did what I did 
 Because I'm not a kid 
 But they looked me down 
 They stared me down 
 Told me what I did 
 I ain't wit' it 
 'Cause word around town was a stickup 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 B-boy niga in a pickup 
 But I was jeepin' and creepin' 
 Just a keepin' it down, sound 
 Here we go the run around 
 Blamin' me for the hardcore roar 
 But they the ones wit' the 44's 
 So I'm coolin' 
 I know the beat is rulin' 
 Too loud for the crowd 
 The bass is large yeah 
 So I'll get the f--- outta Dodge 
 That's right y'all, el commando 
 El commando you're in demand-o 
 Sgt hawkes: 
 Sgt. Hawkes and I'm down wit' the cop scene 
 I'm a rookie and I'm rollin' wit' a swat team 
 Packin' a nine can't wait to use it 
 Crooked cop yeah that's my music 
 Up against the wall don't gimme no lip son 
 A bank is robbed and you fit the description 
 And I ain't your mama and I ain't your pops 
 Keep your music down or you might get shot 
 This is a warning so watch your tail 
 Or I'm a have to put your ass in jail 
 I'm the police and I'm in charge 
 You don't like it get the f--- outta Dodge"
56,Public Enemy,hiphop,Tie Goes To The Runner,"Here a track I found underneath 
 Findin' beats is a treat 
 An' I don't care if it top pop 
 Abracadabra can't keep a tab a 
 This stickin' around like D an' it stuck Chuck 
 Into a mode, unloadin' pop, pop, pop 
 Go the weasels that dropped from the hip hop 
 Kissin' the good bye 
 Goin' goin' gone 
 Keep it flowin' on 
 Like a lemon I ain't livin' 
 Like a lime here's a line 
 To those here's a rose keep the casket closed 
 Gone and in check 
 The next is from the X 
 Wrecked and affected by the rest huh 
 How I'm gonna go I gotta flow 
 'Cause they figure I'm a gonna... 
 Tie goes to the runner 
 Politikin' I be wreckin' 
 I reckon he's the electrician 
 Pullin' the switches on brothers 
 Who be in disposition 
 I never got along wit' the long 
 Arm of the law 
 I saw where they place the hardcore 
 To them it doesn't matter 
 Where it splatter 
 Our blood from the bullet 
 Not ballot I vote for Jim Brown 
 I know it don't rhyme 
 Does it matter that he 
 In fact he won't find 
 Excuses inside of Murphy Brown 
 I'm on a level livin' low 
 Here we go I know 
 If this was Africa I'd try to give a necktie 
 To those runnin' and lyin' disguisin' 
 Three guys (surprise) 
 Tie goes to the runner 
 Not surprised at all 
 About the riot zone 
 And I moan 
 I wish they leave me alone yo 
 This was predicted not self-inflicted 
 By the rapp outta the 'hood 
 They picked it good 
 Hittin' heavy critical aim at all the phony names 
 Prez rembezzlers 
 Who gettin' voted mayor 
 Lookin' at 'em wit' an 
 Evil eye (why lie) 
 I don't buy the fly look 
 As the fall guy 
 I'm livin' low across the tracks 
 Politikin' who stickin' had better 
 Watch their backs 
 In another long hot summer 
 Tie goes to the runner 
 An' I quote 
 I freak da notes 
 I double the dose 
 All she wrote 
 Devour got the power of a double man 
 Get excited just don't bite it or you're in trouble man 
 Got a rhythm to ride 
 A thought provoke 
 'Cause I don't joke 
 Here's a brother wit' an attitude 
 Don't get me rude 
 Chew it up was up it's like food"
57,Public Enemy,hiphop,Hit Da Road Jack,"I remember when us blacks 
 Were on our backs 
 Across tracks 
 Where we live 
 Now we packin' in Cadillacs 
 Or Pontiac if you know 
 What I'm sayin' 
 Po' old nigg thinks it's a Caddy 
 And now he's playin' mack daddy 
 But that's all right I blame it 
 All on Jack 
 Who's Jack you ask me 
 You say, I say it every time 
 But the rhyme goes 
 Into your head down to your toes 
 And you missed me 
 Play it off like a diss, yo 
 Let's go and diss the 
 Wick wick wack 
 Wiggedy whack in fact 
 I'm sayin' hit the road Hack 
 For the hook 
 I'll play it by the book 
 For the track 
 I'll bring it back 
 Look out: Hit the road Jack 
 Black is black 
 White is white 
 That's all right 
 If you're right 
 That's all right 
 No need to fight, yo 
 Much respect if your nature's in check 
 A little 
 If not expect me to cock a doodle do 
 A riddle 
 Just actin' cracka proves to be a 
 Killer to me like I refuse to be a negro 
 But we grow to be people 
 People 
 But our color had 'em playin' us out 
 Like we was Cinderella 
 But if you take it and break it down 
 Full of noise but Jack and his boys 
 Keep doin' what they wanna do 
 But hear me out 
 Jack goes under color 
 To kill one another 
 'Cause some blacks act devil too 
 And if you see him 
 You can tell by his act 
 Not his word but his deed 
 And we bleed all because of that 
 Lifestyle of a dirty rat 
 And if you act like that 
 Step back and hit the road Jack 
 Not Jack the Ripper 
 Or the jack of spades 
 I'm not jackin' for beats 
 Let's get Jack the raper 
 Mothers cried while forefathers died 
 From the whip 
 And not a bit ever made the paper 
 When I come they all 
 Run and hide 
 And they quit 
 And yell loud 
 Here he come wit' dat black s--t 
 I'm through wit Jack 
 Bein' the quarterback of the scene 
 He's played out like bell-bottom jeans 
 I took a line from the Main Source 
 For that 
 I know they feel the same 
 Thank you 
 Hit road Jack"
58,Public Enemy,hiphop,Get Off My Back,"The monkey ain't no joke 
 So you want to mess with the coke 
 Boy oh boy oh boy oh boy 
 The monkey ain't no joke 
 You better leave 'em alone 
 He's home grown, he's the cyclone 
 He's the moan groan, Capone, the clone 
 The broken bone, tone 
 You've got to get off my back 
 We got the real Flavor Flav 
 Gettin' down with the sound 
 And he's tellin' you to get off his back 
 He's on your back gives you no slack 
 Don't give me no flack, because I know 
 Toe to toe, go to go

 So who the hell is you 
 To tell me how my song is wrong 
 You don't know 
 Layout and let the drummer go 
 You think my rap's about stealin' 
 But it's about feelin' 
 Sometimes drug dealin' 
 But few know how my flow 
 Don't get the proper review 
 I gotta do what I gotta do 
 Do whatcha gotta do first 
 Ooh 
 Here go da verse 
 I gotta do what I do best (uh) 
 Kick da Nitti and Ness 
 The danger zone 
 They better leave me alone 
 I got posse 
 Lus the feds had better watch me 
 I picked a bone wit' Arizona 
 Droppin' kickin' a mission 
 Wit' no permission 
 I let 'em know why I did what I did 
 I got dialogue 
 Got 'em to even sing along 
 And got the semiautomatic 
 Tongue to da young 
 When there's static 
 They come and try to get some 
 They had the nerve to call the president 
 An' I wasn't hesitant 
 To scream I was a resident 
 So-called power of the people 
 Lookin' for the truth 
 Like guessin' my vest was never bulletproof 
 I'm edgin' close to the line 
 And it's fine time to know 
 Why the hell and da fuck 
 I try to battle so 
 Much to touch never feedin' 
 A crutch to lean on me 
 Excuses is weak 
 That's why my look is mean 
 To the devils 'bout God 
 Another reason why it's comin' hard 
 My intellect doin' wreckin' effect 
 Till it's through 
 Gotta do what I gotta do 
 I Gotta do what dey don't like 
 'Cause I got a mike 
 The more I push 
 And the more you learn 
 And dey burn, you get another turn 
 To take the helm recreate 
 The realm of leaders 
 Not to say you never need us 
 But in da mirror 
 You can do it, it's so easy to start 
 Yeah baby you can see it on 
 A flow chart 
 And just in case 
 They ever get me in da middle 
 Of things before I go 
 You know I'm gonna take a swang 
 Until dey give what dey never 
 Gave I refuse to be 
 A slave I hijacked 
 The airwaves 
 Let ya know the dirt 
 Swept under the rug 
 Give the brothers a pound 
 My sisters a lil' bigger hugs 
 My rat a tat comin' right 
 And exact 'cause it's true 
 I gotta do what I gotta do"
60,Public Enemy,hiphop,Air Hoodlum,"(Flav) Yo Chuck where you at G?? 
 I think he went upstairs y'know 
 (DJ) A very furious mixture of noise 
 What Public Enemy producer Hank Shocklee calls 
 Music's worst nightmare 
 ""Hey, he's a good kid"" 
 (Chuck D) Air Hoodlum (repeat 2X) 
 (Tony D) Check check, check the elevation (repeat 4X) 
 ""A player, that can leap, with the best of them"" 
 Verse One: 
 Risin' up in the 'Velt, Strong Island, New York 
 The hood in case you did not know my base 
 There was a ballplayer who had all the skills 
 Wit the pill to pay the piper, plus all the bills 
 Mick his first name, Mack the awesome game 
 Practiced in the heat, in the rain or in pain 
 Mick so quick, at six foot six 
 Down to be picked by anyone but the Celtics 
 Oh what a handle could score from the floor 
 With people bangin' on him, or even hangin' on him 
 But what he did best, above all the rest was... 
 ""A player that can leap, with the best of them"" 
 ""As a high school standout..."" 
 ""The skywalker himself!"" 
 ""I felt, he could do, to make this an effective basketball team"" 
 Verse Two: 
 Grades nine and ten, Mickey Mack was all that 
 But in class his ass sat way in the back 
 How I know, 'cause I know, I used to flow wit the bro 
 He didn't mind I used to read him his own headline 
 'Cause he could not read 'em his school wouldn't need em 
 If the lines wouldn'ta went like this 
 Mickey Mack jumped over the candlestick 
 His stack was his stats but his D was still wack 
 Grades eleven and twelve he found the wrong clientele and all 
 During class, he would dribble in the hall 
 But never got in trouble in school, but the trouble was 
 It was cool if your brain was just another bubble 
 As long as he could score fiddy-two 
 Get thirty-three rebounds, fuckin' around 
 Temas lost to him he went right through em 
 Division, county, state, that's three count em 
 Championships for a small town bro 
 That's bound to go pro 
 ""He gets free, turn on the jumper, good!"" 
 ""Streak of lightning when he breaks loose..."" 
 ""We all felt in our hearts we could win this ballgame"" 
 ""They just required me to have the game that I did 
 I'm just... that's all I that's all I that's all I can say"" 
 ""That's all I can say"" 
 ""He hauled down fifteeen rebounds, and kept the ball away from everybody"" 
 ""Then he had a triple double!"" 
 ""A-a-a sensational player..."" 
 Verse Three: 
 SAT's didn't matter 'cause he was all that 
 You know the pat on the back 
 He was always in the news you gotta know what it means 
 It means revenue, and I'm tellin' you 
 I saw cars and G's come to our school please 
 Approach Hell with the principal, where's the coach 
 Went to college four years wit a scholarship... 
 ...And won the championship 
 But when it came to his life he didn't care... 
 ...'Cause he took it to the air 
 ""Cross and a hook, he scores, he's fouled!"" 
 ""From the far corner, breaks West and here's the jumper, good!"" 
 ""There's the jumper, it's not gonna go, rebound batted back..."" 
 (Chuck D) Air 
 Verse Four: 
 The fall began when Mickey Mack fell 
 Hell ripped his kneee drafted last by personnel 
 Oh how he loved the game, it was fantastic 
 Until he was cut, and couldn't stick 
 Times got tighter and tighter 
 He had an attitude was rude, so he turned into a fighter 
 School wouldn't give him the job that he needed 
 Assistant to the assistant coach, they didn't need it 
 Then he resorted to a stick up kid 
 Ski-mask and gat, but this game he wasn't good at 
 And the drugs on the side 
 Police ambushed his ride *gunfire* another homicide 
 He was over, ghost y'know 
 Hometown hero, but now a zero 
 To those hypocrites who ripped him blind 
 For his skills without the will to develop his mind 
 Forever in the news the community views him 
 Only as Air Hoodlum 
 ""I don't understand it, the kid coulda been another Jordan!"""
61,Public Enemy,hiphop,Hazy Shade Of Criminal,"Reach uppity reach gotta reach 
 Power to the people and the beats

 Dumb diggetty dumbb diggetty dumb

 Play a fool 
 While the real thief cools in a pool 
 He who got the finger on the war button 
 Talkin' loud ain't sayin' nuttin 
 TV got 'em bigger than life 
 All he needs is a knife 
 Who's the criminal? 
 To the blind def and dumb 
 Hard to see 'em comin' 
 Don't be dumb diggety dumb 
 Politikin' writin' bad checks 
 Still dey gettin' wreck 
 Goin' fo' a nigga neck 
 Rollin' in a blue 'n' white gang 
 Ready to bang biggedy bang 
 Hangin' 'round da hangin' rope

 I ain't bendin' for the soap 
 Never understood why the 'hood 
 Half od who's in da joint 
 Now dey got me losin' my point 
 Gotta have it goin' on 
 Born criminal born 
 Take a piece of America back 
 But who had it first 
 Hear the Indian curse 
 Robbed and stole so many so much 
 It ain't funny 
 Now who got 'em face on money 
 Politician passin' a bill paid in full 
 C-note rockin' in a pocket 
 How they livin' makin' sure they 
 Lockin' us up I got a feelin' I'm... 
 When it come to somethin' we say 
 What dey don't like is a brother like me 
 On da mike 
 In fact to the gritty ain't none of us wack 
 Noriega had back 
 Jeffrey Dahmer enter the room without cuffs 
 How the hell do we set stuffed 
 In da back of a cell 
 On an isle 
 Ain't it wild 
 What's a criminal? 
 Only if I had one more time to kick 
 The rhythm that keep rippin' down the door 
 So the real crominals get exposed behind the clothes 
 Doors 'n' the suits that make 'n' break da law 
 Lookin' for my own 'cause I had enuff bull 
 I can't understand it must be crooked 
 Way they planned it 
 Police supposed to keep the peace 
 But I can't truss 'em 
 So I keep my piece 
 Loaded and cocked 
 'Cause I don't miss the block 
 I'm talkin' about the ones who don't get chained to the rock 
 While we go away for the neighborhood crime 
 Never liked what I saw in the law 
 Indiana tress hangin' us instead of leaves 
 We hangin' the rope 
 Real criminals..."

 About the other guys 
 Fantasi 'n' gettin' nat rep

 While they disturb the groove 
 Now the partys over ooops! 
 Outta time 
 Yo my brother can you spare a crime 
 Some wanna take me out 
 I even call 'em my own 
 (Can't we all just get along?) 
 Rap iz a contact sport 
 Can I get support 
 When I hum to da maximum 
 What I talk is straight 
 From da sidewalk strong 
 The velt new york 
 112 beatz a minute 
 An I'm flowin in it 
 Have no mercy 
 On da ones that curse me 
 And when I'm in da paint 
 The feuding might be over 
 But the fussin ain't 
 Some hate the way I say em 
 'Cause I block 'em like 
 Zo to da am 
 Beginning of an end of an error 
 Incredible shrinking race 
 Fiend without a face 
 Still got love for em 
 But some ain't got love 
 For the rest of us 
 So my boys get iller than 
 Illinois (terminator) 
 Return to da noise 
 I'd rather fall off 
 Than fall victim of crime 
 And a low percentage rhyme 
 If I go down they goin' wit me 
 So come and get me... c'mon"

 When I'm takin' his sound to bring you down

 Some gangsta lying - I'd rather diss Presidents 
 Dead or alive, bring 'em and I'll swing em

 Flick em, and I fling em, you can go with em 
 Hall of Fame for the game for the points I Dave Bing em 
 Go Grandmama, close but no cigar 
 I got mine, for I'm using my rhyme 
 The flow go wherever I want, and that's clever 
 Give a piece of my time, to prevent some crime 
 And who behind puttin' the guns to the young ones 
 The ones that make 'em is the ones that take em 
 Rugged for no reason, down in duck season

 The day the whole world couldn't do it 
 Repent 
 Oh no! 
 Check the preacher what he spent 
 One way ticket to God to fix scars 
 Woman and man runnin' the land, sea and air poor 
 Do we all go the way of the dinosaur? or 
 To hell and back attack 
 The new clear fog got us sniffin like 
 Atomic dogs 
 Pocket fulla pimp daddy moves 
 Put a code on a can 
 Whatta hell of a man, shootin 
 Trigga pollution, planet prostitution 
 Uprootin da third 
 We go to the way of the bird 
 Can't do whatcha want to da place 
 Don't waste my place 
 Where you from?

 We want justice 
 From public enemy number one 
 To can't trust this 
 Like F Jim or Hyatt 
 Because we're sick and fuckin' tired 
 Of being mistreated by the undefeated 
 Power to the seat that can't be beat 
 Probably gone is the head that make Clinton defeat 
 Do all the talkin' 
 Plus crooked walkin' 
 Blind to the fact 
 That the enemy is stalking 
 Ways for days 
 Search United States quite 
 Were not a full power

 In my neighborhood 
 We attempt to kill each other

 Be strong be righteous 
 Don't be no sinister

 To put your life in full of fear 
 By the favor skies 
 We are flying 
 Truth we be buying 
 To buy out all the lying 
 How you livin' 
 Were you livin' 
 Were you livin' 
 It ain't got to be like that 
 By doing the givin' 
 It was your own choice 
 Scratched up your Rolls Royce 
 Every dum friend you had 
 Was glad to rejoice 
 And turned into a nut 
 Trying to make the pockets fatter 
 One shoot in the head 
 Everybody scatter 
 The worlds gonna 
 Catch on fire 
 A funeral buyer 
 Is a hard heads people desire 
 Every night you tryer 
 You turn into a cryer 
 Who was just in bed 
 Thinkin' higher, higher 
 Friends will always move 
 Till you get the bob wire 
 Ever common law gets a flat tire

 I got tangled 
 In the Star-Spangled Banner 
 In the middle of Alabama 
 Or was it Tennessee or Arkansas 
 New York and Cali got the same 
 Amount of race rallies

 Straight around the neck 
 So I'm knockin' off the hand checks 
 So you can 
 When I say what it is 
 It ain't nutting but a song 
 Krackas, killas, kidnappas 
 KKK tries to blame it on the rappers

 That bounce to the 40 ounce 
 Or the runts dat get stunted

 So many be singin' it 
 Strangled tangled 
 Caught in a Spangled

 A beatdown in a slamma 
 Oh say can you see 
 But you can't 
 Uncle Sammy wears the pants 
 Tom's his bitch 
 When he's swingin' a switch 
 Rather stick da poor up 
 And give it to da rich 
 I always thought dat power 
 Was to the people, we the people 
 Oh say can I see we ain't people 
 When I pledge allegiance 
 I shoulda got a sticka 
 1st grade/2nd grade 
 I shoulda just kicked a 
 Verse in the middle of class 
 Instead of singin' bout bombs 
 Like a dumb ass 
 Land of the free 
 Home of the brave 
 And hell with us niggas we slaves 
 That shoulda been the last line 
 Of a song that's wrong form to get 
 So when everybody stand 
 I sit 
 The red is for blood shed 
 The blue is for the sad ass songs 
 We be singin' in church while white man's heaven is black man's hell 
 The stars what we way when we 
 Got our ass beat 
 Stripes whip marks in our backs 
 White is for the obvious

 They talkin' shit 
 An laughin' like its somethin' funny 
 I aim to make changes 
 An never change 
 Unless its for the better 
 'Cause I always been a go better 
 Clean hustler 
 Rhyme instead of muscle ya 
 Born when ya thinkin' I'm gone 
 The terror era is on... 
 I stand accused 
 To the crews 
 I paid my dues 
 I stand accused 
 I refuse 
 To stand and lose 
 I stand accused 
 To the news 
 I kick da blues 
 I stand accused 
 I refuse 
 I hear 'em talkin' and walkin' 
 Behind my back I'm attacked 
 Fuck the knife in the back 
 Cause it feels like they got an axe 
 Yeah I can dig it wit a shovel 
 I never dig dirt wit the devil 
 Instead I'm on that other level 
 But I took time to reach down 
 To help the black and brown 
 I never stood around 
 I hear 'em talkin' behind 
 My mind 
 In a ocean of sharks 
 And a back full a hackmarks 
 They say I'm fallin' off 
 Yeah, they better call it off 
 And get muscle 
 And find another hustle quick 
 Sick 'n' tired of critics 
 But I can take a hit 
 I'm all man 
 Alley oopin the vocal on jams 
 But they don't know it 
 They can blow it 
 And take a puff of dis joint 
 I see I'm kissin' it off the cuff 
 Behind the back 
 I'm pullin axes and blades out the arms and the legs 
 Still my fellas get paid 
 The terror era is on 
 Fuck a critic/fuck fuck a critic 
 All the fuckin' critics 
 Can get the did dit 
 All a fuckin' critic does is 
 Draw a fuckin' line 
 Cross a line and dis my rhyme 
 And then they ass is mine 
 If you find a critic dead 
 Remember what I said 
 Who killed a critic 
 Guess the crew did it 
 Say paybacks a crazy ass message 
 Sent to the writers who criticize 
 They're fuckin' wit afreedom fighter 
 Who raises flags 
 And dragged the klan in bodybags 
 I hung 'em up in Mississippi and bum fuck 
 This is Chuck so what the hell 
 You think I did it for 
 To open doors from Carolina to Arkansas 
 And lemme let 'em I met em 
 I told my boys forget em 
 An what they did got rid of me 
 Negative 
 But 94 got stunts and blunts in da mix 
 I hear the crowd fallin' vic 
 To old ghetto tricks 
 But if I wasn't your cousin 
 Wed leave 'em in the dozens 
 Of sellin out and bellin out 
 Half pint 40 ounce 
 Announce to the rest 
 We had a fall out 
 I never took a drink 
 Never took a hit or bribe 
 Or got spread by what a silly 
 Rumor said 
 Never sang or gang banged 
 Sold out or rented hip hop 
 'Cause I know when to stop"

79,Public Enemy,hiphop,Hitler Day,"500 years ago one man claimed 
 To have discovered a new world 
 Five centuries later we the people 
 Are forced to celebrate a black holocaust 
 How can you call a takeover 
 A discovery 
 Mass murderer 
 This side of the planet 
 Most people take it for granted 
 502 and still doin' 
 Give a reason I'm hatin' 
 October celebratin' 
 The dead 
 Of the black the brown and red 
 Sick an tired 
 Of bein sick 'n' tired 
 Don't jump to conclusions 
 Before I clear the confusion 
 Ashes to ashes, dust to dust 
 I'm talkin' bout Columbus 
 Hit me one 
 I don't hate nobody 
 I hate that day 
 Its as crazy as Hitler day 
 Hangin' heads and snappin necks 
 Splittin up kin 
 Makin' familys wrecked 
 Turned this planet to a sewer 
 Provin to all just a lil grab 
 Will do ya 
 Or do us 
 So my disgust 
 Got credit from the ones that 
 Read it 
 Ain't blind to the fact 
 Of a whack headline 
 And if you didn't I pay 
 No mind 
 That's how I feel 
 That's how I feel 
 This iz madd real 
 But these days 
 Is crazy as Hitler day 
 I don't hate nobody 
 It's impossible to discover a land 
 When people are already living there 
 Some thanks for the givin' 
 When times are hard 
 And some got the nerve to pray to God 
 Ain't about turkey 
 And cider that gets me sick 
 It's that take from the Indian trick 
 Lookin' pretty grim 
 When they takin' da pill 
 From the sucker seekin' somethin' to kill 
 Now he got a day to celebrate 
 Ain't that a trip 
 Cause the indians ain't got shit 
 May 31st when it comin' it hurts 
 Remember the dead and it makes me curse 
 When they don't include 100 million 
 Of us black folks 
 That died in the bottom of boats 
 I can carry on 'bout the killin' till 
 Dusk and dawn 
 And war ain't the reason they gone 
 Fourth of July a fuckin' lie 
 When did we ever 
 Get a piece of the pie 
 Gotta whole day comin' 
 Without no pay 
 Cause a fuckin' job 
 Can't gimme no play 
 Even had enuff I huff and puff 
 At brothers sellin the stuff 
 Takin' in washingtons 
 Lincolns 
 Not they birthdays 
 Payback for 'em makin' us slaves"

 Sliding down broadway beneath the j line 
 Slumped in the incline position 
 Mind travellin beyond the shell 
 Which holds the soul controlled by the Allah 
 I be most humble but also punishable 
 For those who are unlawful to righteousness 
 I strive to stay alive and live this 
 Many fell victim to the wisdom 
 I mastered this 
 The track ovulates the mic like prostate gland imperegnates 
 Onto the paper the pain pours 
 For the love of my brother that hurts just the same 
 Fuck fame 
 My gun I bust to maintain 
 Moods are insiduous 
 Baffels and eludes those who label the God being anti-social 
 Chose not to apply their third eye 
 I travel at the speed of thought rate 
 It's fatal 
 What will enable a man to levitate 
 Flava Flav: 
 And you can take that and put that on the back of your brain 
 Coming straight to you from Masta Killa

 To make your head fat boy"
82,Public Enemy,hiphop,He Got Game,"If man is the father then the son 
 Is the center of the earth 
 In the middle of the universe 
 Then why is this verse coming 
 Six times rehearsed 
 Don't freestyle much so 
 I write 'em like such 
 Amongst the fiends 
 Controlled by the screens 
 What does it all mean 
 All this shit I'm seein 
 Human beings scream vocal javelins 
 Signs of a local nigga unravelin' 
 My wandering 
 Got my ass wondering 
 Where Christ is 
 In all this crisis 
 Hate and Satan 
 Never knew what nice is 
 Check the papers 
 While I bet on Isis 
 More than your eyes can see 
 And ears can hear 
 Year by year 
 All the sense disappears 
 Nonsense perseveres 
 Prayers laced wit fear 
 Beware 
 2 triple 0 is near 
 It might feel good 
 It might sound a lil' somethin' 
 But damn the game 
 If it don't mean nuttin' 
 What is game who got game 
 Where's the game

 Behind the game

 I got game 
 She got game 
 We got game

 It might feel good 
 It might sound a lil' somethin' 
 But the fuck the game if it ain't saying nothin' 
 Damn was it somethin' I said 
 Pretend you don't see 
 So you turn your head 
 Race scared of it's shadow 
 Does it matter? 
 Thought areparations 
 Got 'em playin' wit the population 
 Nothing to lose 
 Everything's approved 
 People used 
 Even murders excused 
 White men in suits 
 Don't have to jump 
 Still there's 1001 ways 
 To lose wit the shoes 
 God takes care of ol' folks and fools 
 While the devil takes care 
 Of makin' the rules 
 Folks don't even own themselves 
 Payin' mental rent 
 To corporate presidents 
 1 outta 1 million residents 
 Be a dissident 
 Who ain't kissin' it 
 The politics of chains and whips 
 Got the sick 
 Missin' chips and championships 
 What's love got to do 
 Wit what you got 
 Don't let a win get to your head 
 Or a loss to your heart 
 Nonsense perseveres 
 Prayers heed wit fear 
 Beware 
 2 triple 0 is near 
 It might feel good 
 It might sound a lil' somethin' 
 But damn the game 
 If it don't mean nuttin'

 Hey yo my man sing it 
 There's something happening yeah 
 What it is ain't exactly clear 
 There's a man with a gun over there 
 Telling me I've got to be ready 
 It's time we stop chilling 
 What's that sound 
 Everybody look what's going down 
 It's time we stop chilling 
 What's that sound 
 Everybody look what's going down 
 Hey yo these are some serious times that we living through g 
 And a new world order is about to begin 
 You know what I'm saying 
 Now the question is are you ready 
 For the real revolution 
 Which is the evolution of the mind 
 If you seek then you shall find 
 That we all prove from the divine 
 You dig what I'm saying 
 Now if you take heed 
 To the words of wisdom 
 That are written on the walls of life 
 Then universally we will stand 
 And divided we will fall 
 Cause love conquers all 
 You understand what I'm saying 
 This is a call to all you sleeping souls 
 Wake up and take control of your own cipher 
 And be on the look out for the spirits tonight 
 Trying to steal your light 
 You know what I'm saying 
 Look what beside yourself 
 For peace 
 Give thanks 
 Live life 
 And release 
 You dig me 
 You got me"

 Black to black 
 You should a seen 'er 
 Long and winding road to the arena 
 Crystal ball 
 I prophesized 
 What was on the horizon 
 Forewarned y'all 
 Is it any wonder 
 What kind of ground you goin' under 
 A September ender 
 To march madness remember? 
 You never heard a murder 
 Take for example 
 Unsolved mystery 
 Life lost in a funk sample 
 Enter the bandwagons 
 Braggin hangin' banners 
 Clearin the way for younger MCs 
 And new hammers 
 What was criticized six years back 
 Is now back 
 With New York on the jersey front and back 
 Feel like Tiger Woods 
 Got madd goods 
 Way up from the cheap seats 
 Comin' outta the hood 
 Race to the black seats 
 Amongst the wack seats 
 Be the hardcore 
 Alongside the deadbeats 
 The world lookin' on 
 Like spectators 
 At crucified gladiators 
 Feels like a jungle inside 
 Where fish swim birds fly 
 Man got a tendency to die 
 Man falls to the hands of man 
 But damn if I'll ever try 
 To survive at courtside 
 Four tickets to fly 
 Rap or play ball do the game 
 Or duck the drive by 
 Same league that defends 
 Be the same ones that do us in 
 Spys 
 Cia - fbi 
 And them suits in that 
 Corporate sky 
 Eye for an eye 
 The target is the bad guy 
 Heard the war is on 
 >From the announcer 
 Bound to get the crowd 
 Bouncin' 
 Yes and it counts and 
 In this corner representin the 
 Best in the west 
 Died from four bullets 
 Two in the chest 
 Worshipped on the other side 
 Of TV sets 
 Had madd fans 
 Comin' outta both sex 
 Sold, multi platinum 
 Eight times gold 
 But died of homicide 
 Twenty five years old 
 Heard he died in debt too 
 I ain't seen a winner yet, you? 
 The confused crowd boos 
 The move shit 
 In that corner 
 Number one in the east 
 The peace cursed for life 
 By the mark of the beast 
 Raised by peeps rode jeeps 
 Deep in Brooklyn beats 
 Praised as a hero 
 Who came up off the streets 
 The crowd looks on 
 Claimin sides they don't own 
 A house built up on 
 Their skulls and bones 
 Knew it be a matter of time 
 The play by play 
 Two rappers slain 
 Main 
 So let us pray 
 Wit all the gunnin 
 Crowd goin' crazy 
 Gettin' bigger 
 Proud to be called a bunch 
 Bitches and niggas 
 The ghetto stage fulla 
 Field nigga goals 
 Hip hop shoot outs vs those house negros 
 Five bodies got on the shot clock 
 Runnin' down in the count made 
 The scoreboard rock 
 The referees the LAPD 
 The LVPD 
 Said they couldn't catch 
 What they couldn't see 
 Question 
 Was it bigger than the names 
 Not only in the game 
 But the game behind the game 
 Down to the remaining 
 Seconds of this record 
 Anatomy of a murder 
 Intensity of a mystery 
 Dead and gone 
 As the heads looked on 
 Helpless 
 As the atmosphere preyed on 
 Investigating 
 And the winner be 
 Interscope/UNI Arista/BMG 
 Lost in overtime 
 Da tombstone trophy for people that shit 
 The rhymes that died 
 Beats that deceased 
 Fuck best 
 Rest in peace 
 Rainy days from stormy nights 
 Though the stars shined 
 Days were bright 
 That was then this is now 
 That was them this is how 
 Rainy days from stormy nights 
 Though the stars shined 
 Days were bright 
 Live and die by the sword 
 Come playoff time 
 Is your lord a god 
 Or is your god a dog?"

 Hard to live without we 
 Catchin hell without he

 Human highlight flicks 
 They wanna be 
 Hobbys turned to robberys 
 They killin' me 
 The gun didn't know I was loaded 
 Devil attempts to get heroes railroaded 
 Stole the ball from lost souls

 Confused wit moses in street clothes

 Blessed to do this

 Where the shot clock at 
 Don't back me if I come 
 Wit milky raps 
 Smack me if I rhyme on 
 Silky tracks 
 Takes a nation to get back - huh 
 Mike sometimes the opposite 
 Of watcha like 
 I'm tired of taps within 
 Sometimes your brain's your cell 
 Prisons the skin you in 
 Gettin' change beyond the point

 Soldiers of the future 
 We are approachin with to be Earth's last battle 
 The war fever's on the rise 
 The lives of many are in the hands of fate 
 Armageddon is the destiny we await 
 In the trenches of the ghettos we meditate 
 Developin our defense, I'm gettin' tense 
 I hear the bombs of time tickin 
 As the smoke of fear thickens in the air 
 I cock my glock and give thanks 
 For the peace that will exist, when this war is over 
 Revolutions, revelations will be revealed 
 Babylon has fallen, now time to build, labwars

 Make you flip to the music with your shit half-lit 
 Harder than time and convicts 
 Rhymes never be basic, afraid of the dark 
 Twenty-five to the L, no I just can't face it 
 Need a mill for two passports and face-lifts 
 Ain't tryin' to see handcuffs and steel bracelets 
 Twisted politics, high speed chases 
 On the races, locked down places 
 Prophet of rages, reincarnation as gauges 
 Set to show off in the blazes 
 Revolution, revelation, resurrection stages 
 Raw like wild dogs locked up in the cages 
 And my brain cell with ice picks under the floor 
 Plottin the war I'll sign a Shakur for sure 
 Revisited, hear the shorties be quizzin it 
 Geronimo Platt, politically incarcerated cats 
 I dwell on all the black males doin' time 
 And got me wanderin who invented motherfuckin crime 
 Goin' in a tantrum lyrical fits 
 Spread like cancer on tracks that hit 
 Feel the pulse in the boom in the night song 
 Rally up all the people like a Farrakhan 
 Spittin' words that'll send 'em back to Peningon 
 Hittin cats in the head out in Lebanon 
 Through the New World order I'ma carry on 
 Hittin brothers with jewels they can grow on 
 More than wack videos in a dance song 
 If you don't believe it so long and so on 
 So on, prove the player haters so wrong 
 I don't care who the fuck is out there yeah 
 My militant mind stay guerilla zone 
 Shorties feelin' me in the chest like a silicone 
 Get ya home with a honeycomb 
 Go to any Coast I'ma bet ya I'ma bust chrome 
 Once again in Terrordome I'll show em

 It is time, time for a drastic change. 
 Time to retaliate and wake up 
 I've had enough, enough of the lies 
 Enough of the destruction, information and corruption's. 
 False religions, doctors and puddy compoundin and who gets in trouble? 
 And I won't stop no, no 
 No more violence, no, no, no more induses 
 And no more two-face politicians who stab you in the back 
 Plus, mother is too long and I'm densing. 
 And I'll attack and I won't hold back 
 I'm gonna trouble you, hold you and squeeze you 
 Until the truth is told

 Hey yo, Chuck, yo the world if sleepin', G 
 We got to wake everybody up yo 
 Hey yo, it's goin' down, baby 
 Let everybody know how it's goin' down, baby 
 (Verse 1: Chuck D) 
 The way this goes down is simple, from this day forth 
 Anything to deal with rap, STAY OFF 
 It's just the players, no pay offs, strictly skills (uh) 
 If you're brain's the same you'll stick to your deals 
 And this field ain't about sellin' a mil' 
 With the run of the mill, so just be tellin' the real 
 It ain't like a third time fella's appeal 
 Till the GOD scolds him and tells him to deal 
 I'll allow you to write, maybe allow you to bite 
 If you're down to fight the power here's the power to fight 
 Overpower the mic, hit the crowd with the bomb diggy 
 Ring the alarm, now the squads with me 
 From way back I show now weakness when I speak this 
 Mentally strong to keep this hit in my speeches given 
 Now listen from the beginnin' till I reach the endin' 
 My short stories winnin' and keep the beats spinnin' 
 (Chorus: Public Enemy) 
 You know the name, P.E.! 
 You know the game, P.E.! {*scratches*} 
 We ain't for the game 
 We for the change 
 I wake up everyday with my game face on 
 You know the name, P.E.! 
 You know the name, P.E.! {*scratches*} 
 Yeah we ain't for the fame 
 We for the change 
 I wake up everyday with my game face on 
 (Verse 2: Chuck D) 
 Break harder than ever, follow my lead 
 Through the fast lane in the game, they follow my speed 
 Either ease off the gas or floor it 
 You ain't ready to get it, I dunno why they keep askin' for it 
 This the real P.E., ain't no castin' for it 
 Cop lights, news camera, no action for it 
 Get the uncut raw, we somewhat sure 
 Hip hop's like a chess game, discussin' the war 
 Strategize, move like masterminds 
 When it's your go and your do', just cash mine 
 Last time we welcomed y'all to the Terrordome 
 Used the mic to reach out and touch, instead of the phone 
 I appear from the rear, stayin' from clear 
 Nobody can say if I'm here so they play it by ear 
 But here's the way I lay the idea 
 From this point on, the rest of '98, put it in high gear 
 (Chorus: Public Enemy) 
 You know the name, P.E.! 
 You know the game, P.E.! {*scratches*} 
 We ain't for the fame 
 We for a change 
 I wake up everyday with my game face on 
 You know the name, P.E.! 
 You know the game, P.E.! {*scratches*} 
 We ain't for the fame 
 We for a change 
 I wake up everyday with my game face on 
 (Verse 3: Professor Griff) 
 I saw it comin', premeditated world domination hesitated 
 Rough this nuclear war head, detonate it 
 I'm forbidden, so I stay hittin' up forgiven 
 For givin' the livin' the truth, 360 proof 
 So world look before this world's took 
 I curl books under my arm 
 Smoke charm and learn about this world's (???) 
 Revelation the world cooks 
 I spit gold versus the pearl hooks 
 The first album made the world crooks 
 Got 'em snatchin', robbin', thievin', stealin' ideas 
 Believe in pleadin' reason for treason, conceal it for years 
 My criminal (???) attract an accomplice to grub something 
 Results DRASTIC MEASURES 
 And the death of joy, the death of casket treasure 
 From the abyss, the greatest trick I played on the world 
 Was leadin' them to believe my mother's clit didn't exist 
 Then I extended the list 
 Revolutioned every flag raised by a clenchin' fist 
 (Outro: Flava Flav) 
 Yeah that's right, once again 
 Smooth the Hustler, and he ain't no crowd buster 
 Straight up Iceberg Slim

 To score on anybody, its war on everybody 
 The new guys come in blood shot between the eyes 
 As long as their sellin that merchandise 
 And one what goes in don't come back 
 The color may be green but its also black 
 And red I know many heads that spent bloodshed 
 Cursed in converses, dead in Pro Keds 
 Now every Tom, Dick, Harry or Joe Smith 
 Skip the spauldings, pony's, and k-swiss 
 High school and college coaches gettin' 
 Kickbacks from scholarships and them slave ships 
 Hey Dr. J where you got those moves 
 Was it gettin' high in the schools 
 Can it be the shoes? 
 Truth is truth, I tear the fuckin' roof off the house 
 Expose them foes with my mouth 
 I see corporate hands up in foreign lands 
 With the man behind the man gettin' paid behind the man 
 I hold the rocket stop the hand in my pocket 
 200 a pair but I'm addicted to the gear 
 They'll make me do things on the court to amaze ya 
 I heard they make 'em for a buck 8 in Asia 
 They came a long way baby since 
 Clyde Frazier had pumas, pullin mad consumers 
 Them Filas I'm feelin' but I can't touch the ceiling 
 Them New Balance hits 120 million 
 The last thing I need is Adidas terminatin my contract 
 For wearing those old pair of wack 
 Reebok low tops covered up by floppy socks 
 Gave me a jump shot before I got jumped and shot 
 Duckin a word from my sponsor 
 Trying to end my year like Kwaanza 
 Been paid since the 8th grade 
 11th grader, pop the champagne 
 12th grade start the campaign 
 Gettin' fame sign my name in the dotted frame 
 Nike got me pullin re's and g's 
 Shit, I can get shot for these 
 Please god give me 20 more years on these knees 
 To maintain without this game I gotta do keys 
 And I don't wanna go there because its fuckin' everywhere 
 Factories wanna be me kids wanna see me 
 Behind the wheels and endorsement deals 
 It's the politics and the tricks behind the kicks"

 Thin line between getting bucks and gettin' wild. 
 Brooklyn style, hundred thousand miles. 
 Parque tiles, leavin' ankles broke in a pile. 
 Son got a ticket to fly, he can make it if he try, 
 To the sky, like a Coney Island ride. 
 Gettin' pages, from his super agent, 
 Community raises at the clout or the cages. 
 No doubt, center stages, mad phases, 
 >From behind crazies flippin through the faces. 
 Paper chases, love that many places. 
 Pros and cons, flics between the races. 
 He hold the rock, call for sweat shops. 
 Guard the set shop replaced by sex shops. 
 The highest bidder, no room for the quitter. 
 Gave seven tickets, under counterfittas. 
 Three cities a week, droppin' needles.

 Jesus (Check it out)

 Smack the back ups, pack them pick ups. 
 Resurrection of the two man vocal section. 
 The spirit in your dark ass direction. 
 Duckin' them spray ups on my way that I thought be lay ups. 
 Won the battle wars, a thousand one push ups. 
 Here marks the return of them rules about Ruff Ryders. 
 Risin', chargin' hard from the point guard. 
 Watch what you prey for, but know the team that you play for. 
 Need I say more? 
 Uh, scared of the resurrection, 
 Sacrifice yours, them maybe the revolution is basketball. 
 Changes, generanges. Which means rearrange shit, 
 Erase shit, stuck on Playstations. 
 Then the new plantations, I said a millions heads. 
 Waitin' for another nation. 
 To make your world be free. 
 No shoppin' sprees, there ain't no stoppin' me. 
 Here's the fee, not the weed. 
 Got to see, God speed. What you need is... 
 Sticky D gives you fits, on them turnaround hypocrites. 
 Comin' and goin' like flics.

 Gettin' all the chips musta been a road trip against the Knicks. 
 On TV showcasin' kicks. 
 Must be the fan cause his video gettin' all the chicks.

 So I parallel the brains of cobain 
 Show no shame like the pain of kane 
 Gettin' madd opposition hip to the game 
 It's that gran ol' pe ammo 
 Different time different channel 
 Funky piano 
 Here to witness get on up with a quickness 
 S1's in the house 
 Wit the thickness that get dis 
 1 2 3 4 5 attackin they frat 
 Griff is back got 5 on it black 
 The track got x on the decks 
 Terminators back cause a dat is whack 
 On the 1 and 2 
 Yeah go flavor 
 Pe hit the road gettin' set to explode 
 Fight the power for peace 
 Can't forget the war mode 
 Overload 
 There she blows 
 Here we go 
 Now you know 
 Damn another alamo 
 Do you wanna go our way 
 This the way we puttin' this down 
 Do you wanna go our way

 Fell to the ground like folgers 
 Couldn¹t hold the boulder 
 Fancy dancer paralyzed for an answer 
 In the hip hop game but the rap got cancer 
 Tumors poppin' from the middle of rumors 
 Generation x be the end of baby boomers 
 Is the next generation headed for doom 
 Control the soul and you got a got a 
 Truck fulla fertilizer blowin' up the spot 
 Think it¹s terrorism the border line¹s hot 
 Check the passports tap the telephone 
 Surprise they home grown 
 And one of your fuckin' own 
 It¹s dat same ol shit - dat same ol game 
 From that same ol gang up to that same ol thing 
 Now what I see say you know me 
 I pour a metaphor of lsd 
 I don¹t know what y'all thinkin' about 
 But if you know like I know 
 You better strap on your seatbelt 
 Cause you in for a long ride 
 Now I be damn I been a man 
 Figure I never call myself a nigger 
 To get benjamans 
 What¹s love got to do wit what you got 
 Not a whole lot / no forgot oh this shit is hot 
 Spendin all the cheddar for clothes 
 Wit a sign foreclosed on the front mud 
 Lost in dominoes 
 Now the heads tell tales 
 How the dead bled and fled 
 Now they livin' up in the bed 
 Instead they seize us like Jesus 
 Married to the mob did a sloppy job in hempstead 
 Lord had mercy wanna curse me 
 New world order got my ass drownin in the water 
 Now what you stuck to the west 
 That funk to the east is phat 
 Atl be krunk dirty south 
 Thirty thou crankin trunks 
 Try to pass the test but to the rest they flunk 
 Now what be indebted 
 Better get over it 
 Those times and raps ain¹t never comin' back 
 No future without a pass I kick ass 
 Rock the sox offa pandora¹s box 
 Is itany wonder why the clocks flavor got 
 Between rehearsin a verse my jaw lox 
 I set the bomb between the r & b scene 
 Go against the grain run up on the train 
 And so I parallel the brains of cobain 
 As hip hop brain made 'em spill the champagne 
 Make it plain the sound remains insane 
 Come the same no holes closin up the lane 
 Don¹t ask no questions on the simple level 
 Can the magic get shaq back 
 Knicks get van exel 
 Bold rap lyrics fuck whatcha heard 
 Not no lost and found nouns or half ass words 
 Turnaround funk power moves ruffs 
 I ain¹t never been cuckoo for no coco puffs 
 Lsd, set it free make 'em see the tricks 
 Rather try at 37 than die at 26 
 Lawyers no loyalties accountants no royalties 
 Lie for a lie I look 'em in the eye 
 History speaking lawyers should die 
 Kissed the companies and made them all cry 
 A new rap song and a real drive by 
 Why o why did the video die 
 The narcs and the feds got the pimp niggas fraid 
 Threat of the aids got the bitches afraid 
 The god damn white man got you afraid 
 Social service got your mama afraid 
 Scared of the fact before a niggas black 
 Some of you say nigga before you say crack 
 You got no back is what you lack 
 Just say black and i¹ll see where your ass is at"

 Needin needles like the beatles needin ringo 
 From the beginnin I told you how to see through the linen 
 All that talk but that¹s the way 
 The side walks in new york 
 I simplify cause you might be high 
 Rip shit in the pit so what you don¹t like it 
 This is man shit a hip hop trip 
 On that aggressive tip but rap got pussy whipped 
 Got out psyched down on that turnpike 
 I knew this philly who just wouldn¹t get right 
 'Cause I was aware as a square in delaware 
 Execs writing checks for sex in spandex 
 Radios gettin' sucked by labels under the table 
 Mix DJ¹s gettin' overpaid for airplay 
 Try to shut me down like ray, what I say? 
 Fuck your friends and may the best jam win 
 Here I go ---- there you go 
 Mirror mirror i¹m finger pointin at the man 
 It is i, I interrupt the program 
 Chuck d rubberneckin with the fans 
 Pe don¹t give a damn about uncle sam 
 And on and on like I said before 
 Some, the 100 meter dash, i¹m the marathon 
 Against the grain comin' like a train 
 As you listen to the sounds that remains insane 
 One on one and it¹s just begun 
 To get out the ghetto and get something done 
 To be the man you gotta beat the man 
 Don¹t confuse me with being dumb or bubble gum 
 And i¹ll be here as you disappear 
 And i¹ll be around amongst the crowd 
 Cause anything I wear is a step on down 
 That¹s how i¹ve always been 
 And may the best jam win..."

 Compensation we ain't seein 
 Split by Europeans 
 Damn, treated less than human beings 
 No matter, Africa, Brazilia, St. Louis or the Caribbean 
 Traveled the seven seas 
 Rocked many races 
 Spread the cash clean trash in a lot of low places 
 Seen the look of love on many mad faces 
 When I rhymed about the times and not the paper chases 
 People all over the world givin' mad respect 
 When I identified who the Government wrecked

 Far from a meal and a cot 
 On the corner 
 Where all the streets got the same name 
 Maybe my brains on the brink of insane 
 Pain between the papers while sleepin' on the train 
 This the land of milk and honey 
 Know what I'm sayin' 
 The invisible man times three 
 Black, down and out 
 Out standing on a corner no doubt 
 Now a nation of homeless 
 Sleepin' in bus stations 
 Another win for the pilgrims 
 Who said no more haitians 
 As I proceed 
 Someone to feed me is what I need 
 Through three blocks of dealers 
 Tryin' to hit me off wit weed 
 Avenue and boulevard hungry as a Motherfucker 
 Hope to get a ride from a trucker 
 Everybody know I ain't no sucker 
 Everyone used to drop 30 at the rucker 
 Away from crazy kids in generation wrecked 
 Dissin pyramids while praisin projects 
 Walk past old folks gettin' no respect 
 Callin young folks a bunch a no good rejects 
 And I walk on 
 An eye for an eye 
 I can't recognize the man in the mirror 
 Is it I, it is I now who this cat I'm lookin' at 
 'Cause I've been waiting so long to get where I'm goin' 
 An eye for a eye in this country tis of thee 
 Now how the hell can I be free 
 Who this cat I'm lookin' at 
 'Cause I been lost so long without anybody knowin' 
 So I move on and I walk on 
 Past the preachers and the pimps gettin' their talk on 
 Now why do home gotta be where the negative roam 
 To be or not to be so I roll alone 
 I'm trapped within this skin and these bones 
 Temporary kings on cellular phones 
 Can I last as I walk past 
 Cigarette Billboards and Malt Liquor Ads 
 Walkin' on broken bottles and potato chip bags 
 Everyone I see got the nerve to brag 
 Where they from what they got 
 And don't own squat 
 Disrespect where they from and ya might get shot 
 Zombies askin me what the latest Bomb Bay 
 Should shot the fuckin' sheriff and the fuckin' deputy 
 For ok in the drug trade and lettin it be 
 But I know prison for me is an industry 
 So I Walk 
 I heard the best things in life be free 
 Didn't god make the land the air we breathe 
 Not for the homeless don't give a damn about me 
 In the mirror somebody else is starin' at me 
 Maybe prison is the skin I'm within 
 All this time I been sufferin can't fix it wit a bufferin 
 Plus they said I'll never work in this town again 
 Damn so I keep on walkin' 
 An eye for an eye 
 I can't recognize the man in the mirror 
 Is it I, it is I now who this cat I'm lookin' at 
 'Cause I've been waiting so long to get where I'm goin' 
 An eye for an eye in this country tis of thee 
 Now how the hell can I be free 
 Who this cat I'm lookin' at 
 'Cause I been lost so long without anybody knowin' 
 Lil day day is big day and just did time 
 Seen him standin on the unemployment line 
 Which collided wit the line of the health clinic 
 I seen Crazy Stacy her ass standin up in it 
 No more welfare cut her medicaid 
 Damn my mama used to do her braids 
 I keep walkin' so they don't see me 
 But I doubt if they doin' any better than me 
 So I walk on never take the planet for granted 
 I paved the concrete, asphalt and granite 
 I walk pastast three brothers sittin' on the porch 
 Wit a yard of dirt and littered wit Newports 
 Talkin' how they comin' up while they sittin' on their ass 
 As I walk past 'em I'm a target of their laughs 
 And one said let's get 'em for his fuckin' stash 
 As I walked fast past the other yards wit grass 
 Had a lil cash tried to make it last 
 From a few deals I made from cleanin windshields 
 I ran like a rally they caught me in an alley 
 Can't get out the ghetto from New York to Cali 
 I thought I had nothin' till I felt the knife 
 And now I ain't even got a life"

 Takin' cheese out of poor nations 
 Got haitians still on sugar plantations 
 Wiped 'em out called it exotic vacations. 
 As you dig it they set up regulations 
 Turn the rest of the world into cancer patients. 
 What¹s the diff no buts ands or ifs... 
 Now I need a place to hide away. 
 Are you ready are you ready 
 Whose the real docs of death 
 Oh no it¹s doctor death 
 Killer man atomic b-boys in Japan. 
 Another brother dies up in sudan 
 Kevorkian got the heads lookin' for that kill em 
 Dead from the feds shit man 
 Contaminated in sad predicaments 
 Blood threats, blastin continents 
 Kings, queens dead presidents 
 Can¹t tell me where my chiza went. 
 Take 'em down blow the house down blaw 
 The evils got you wobblin like weebles 
 Thinking you equal, killin' lost peoples 
 No sequal remember biko 
 Whose the real docs of death 
 Oh no it¹s doctor death 
 Whose the real docs of death 
 Killin' millions till they¹re last breath 
 Got no right to be dead ass wrong 
 Killin' me softly with your songs 
 Bring the noise 
 But surrounded by cowboys 
 Indigenous but wiped out 
 Diggin new ditches 
 Can you dig it 
 Turnin' tricks at the tip of politics 
 The devils slick, gettin' their head split 
 I spit at those hypocrites 
 So I sticks to the music 
 Think about it it¹s god 
 You better get with the scene 
 Keep you and I from being human beings 
 You deserve what you deserve, 
 If you believe what he believes 
 And into everything you leave. 
 Oh what a tangled web you weave, 
 When destroyed by the disease by 33 degrees 
 Bringing Satan down to his knees"
107,Public Enemy,hiphop,Swindlers Lust,"A dollar a rhyme but we barely get a dime 
 If you don't own the master 
 Then the master own you 
 Who do you trust from swindler's lust 
 From the back of the bus 
 Neither one of us control the fate of our soul 
 And swindler's lust 
 Hickory dickory dock hand in my pocket 
 Robbed me for my chocolate 
 Mo dollars mo cents for the big six 
 Another million led to bled claimin they innocence 
 Is it any wonder why black folks goin' under 
 Cause niggas be sold in bundles 
 No pressure tell me why they don't care 
 Rap and r & b pavin the streets of belair 
 From the sales of singers no longer here 
 The bigger killer gets the bigger share 
 Now the ones I attack the negros got their back 
 And know 80-20 is a whack contract 
 Forever lack the voice of real black 
 Stole rock and roll and ain't gave it back 
 Started off my defense 
 Now they're the ones I defend against 
 Who fell up into the tricks 
 Fuck the fight the power shit 
 Get that chuck d nigga fixed 
 And keep him up outta the mix 
 Well hell tell 'em chuck don't suck no dick 
 Be an ass and the ass get kicked 
 Hand in my pocket robbed me for my chocolate 
 Watch 'em swindle yo ass and turn a profit 
 If you don't own the master 
 Then the master own you 
 Who do you trust from swindler's lust 
 From the back of the bus 
 Neither one of us control the fate of our soul 
 And swindler's lust 
 They don't care about me 
 They don't care about you 
 They don't care about you and ya crew 
 Ya family neighborhood and plus 
 They don't give a damn about us 
 Profit off the soul of black folk 
 Turn 'em into bitchez and niggas 
 And stupid ass jokes 
 Laugh wit us or laughin' at us 
 That is what I'm guessin 
 We interrupt this program wit that question 
 Laughin' all the way to the bank 
 Remember dem own the banks 
 And dem g-damn tanks 
 Now what company do I thank 
 Ain't this a bitch heard they owned slaves 
 And a ship that sank 
 If you don't own the master 
 Then the master own you 
 Who do you trust from swindler's lust 
 From the back of the bus 
 Neither one of us control the fate of our soul 
 And swindler's lust 
 This is for the blues people in the delta 
 This is for everybody in the 50's that didn't get their money 
 Little richard gettin' half a penny a penny 
 All the super soul singers of the 60's 
 All the bands of the 70's on the outside lookin' in 
 All the people that didn't make a dime off their session playin' 
 And even the rappers in the 80's and the 90's 
 Still tryin' to get paid for what they put in 
 If you don't own the master 
 Then the master own you 
 Who do you trust from swindler's lust 
 From the back of the bus 
 Neither one of us control the fate of our soul 
 And swindler's lust"

 Raised the whole fam 
 Now that sounds hot, I stopped the robots 
 Children of the gone who the grown forgot 
 Lost and then found ex lovers of hip hop 
 Who watched another artform gone to rot 
 Beyond the bushes I save a lot 
 Under the underground sound of hip hop 
 And even if this joint gets hot 
 You'll still never ever know what I got

 Man has a period, its called war 
 May the power go to 
 Everyday people 
 May war have no sequel, live... 
 Reverse the word you get evil 
 Cause people wanna live against evil 
 Avoid the third world war 
 Biological bombs 
 100 times worse than vietnam

 But we'd like to say that every single month 
 We should recognise the rich culture 
 And heritage of black people 
 Although the battles have not been won yet 
 We should be proud to take some time out this month 
 To explore the powerful and victorious lineage of our people

118,Public Enemy,hiphop,...And No One Broadcasted Louder Than... (Intro),"(Sample) 
 ""...I'm not gonna lie and act like I always thought all hip-hop or rap was the world's greatest thing, but Public Enemy made me realize that all rap is not the same. They made the world listen, they articulated the frustrations and anger of the black community. More importantly they changed the perception of what hip-hop could be. Chuck D. said that rap was the CNN of the black community and no one broadcasts louder than..."""
119,Public Enemy,hiphop,New Whirl Odor,"Check that soul in 
 Tape is rollin' 
 Black don't crack 
 Where the party at? 
 Stax, jumpback 
 Wax them tracks 
 Barkays cut it live 
 Like 45s 
 Strong songs survive 
 On records 
 95 beats per second 
 Get it mike on the guitar c'mon wreck it 
 You go ooh ah there go them superstars, of soul 
 20 times better than gold, stax, 
 Keep it here 
 Cuttin' them tracks, relax 
 Pop them fingers, play it barkays 
 Jumpback baby 
 Soul gotcha crazy 
 Cold feet thanks 
 For the groove 
 And them bomb beats 
 To make me move 
 Color of dead 
 Looks like the future is history 
 Why you dissin me 
 Ain't no mystery 
 On the outside peekin in 
 End of your freeride 
 No way you can win 
 Beginnin of the end 
 Of your liberal friends who pretend 
 Everythings changed 
 While nuthins changed much 
 Uh this is chuck 
 Stays to the left of this 
 And to the right of that 
 Just black where my mind be at 
 Shit where's the rest of my cats? 
 High trees catch a lotta wind my friend 
 My shits in a bind 
 Fine line between aware and blind 
 Don't mind 
 Some of them ain't got a mind 
 Mind over matter 
 They don't mind 
 And we don't matter 
 I flock to refugees 
 Who flock to me 
 The roots the coup 
 And kick aside the genocide and the juice 
 Comedians actors nuclear reactors 
 Players and ballplayers 
 Singers dancers and rhyme sayers 
 Why do us like you do 
 Ska doo 
 Fuck da residue 
 Frustrated 5 on 2s 
 No breaks for madd crews 
 Nowwho the fuck is you 
 Sick a you 
 Community hoesis 
 Who posin as moses 
 In street clothist 
 Who be the closest who blows it 
 Every ryme be for the future of mankind 
 Crazy heads cuttin' off the dreds 
 Ruin health 
 Wit no knowledge of self 
 Incomin taxes breakin backs off a blacks 
 Who done 400 years in this abyss? 
 And so I'm pissed the fuck at this new whirl odor 
 So I piss 
 Some things in the air 
 When the smoke clears 
 Will it only be white folks and black jokes 
 How many be gone 
 If they bomb barbershops and hair salons 
 Time to dot com 
 Before they rub out clubs 
 Where you get your drink on 
 Mother father sister bro 
 Love is the message 
 But war be the front page 
 In this mess-age 
 Ghetto celebs spread by the hundred 
 Macked by the same tactics 
 Wit us in a tundra 
 Goin' under 
 Avoidin cries from sodimized 
 Society 
 Scary getting screwed without a dictionary"

 Gotta grudge against a judge 
 Kick 'em out that seat 
 You are what you eat 
 So what you eatin'? 
 Same message to your mind 
 Be self defeatin' 
 Sick n tired of bein' sick 
 And tired of bein' beaten 
 Saw 'em drop it like it 
 Was way too hot and too fast 
 For hip hop, doo wop, rock or bop 
 Ain't here to hurt you 
 Don't hang in them circles

 That's what's up 
 Feedback from truly

 Box of hard knocks 
 Lined 'em up at Fort Knox 
 To die in Iraq 
 You don't know I rock? 
 What you under a rock? 
 Old cats beggin' us to bring that beat back 
 Each generation thinks 
 The next one is wack 
 Jump started in the daze of crack 
 R&B Reagan, daddy Bush 
 Way the hell on back

 Good god, uh, can't get no help 
 I say again health care cutback 
 Shit is wack 
 Bring that beat back 
 They say the youth don't matter 
 And the old don't mind 
 It takes a lotta spine 
 To build all them young minds 
 Some of us get ghetto at the wrong damn time 
 Album what? We just makin' one at a time 
 To save another brother whose life on the line 
 A big shot to claim some rocks and shine 
 Signs of a soul gone solo, robbed blind 
 A very small part of half the worlds crime 
 Runaway child blown by an old land mine 
 Little ones workin' in diamond mines 
 So cats can say what's hers and what's mine 
 Diamonds is girls best friend 
 So why's he cryin'? 
 See when y'all hear it get near it 
 And you recognize the lyrics 
 You trained to refrain 
 And you start to fear it 
 Escapism 
 Like today there ain't racism 
 Obviously y'all ain't see 
 Black folks on TV 
 Judgment calls 
 Made on behalf of you and me 
 Or you and I 
 Do or die 
 I say an I for an I 
 Dividin' line 
 Got the poor people 
 Payin' for crime 
 Corporations gettin' paid off our jail time 
 Now y'all can tell Russell 
 Yes, I knock the hustle 
 'Cause 2 million in lock down 
 Under federal muscle 
 Beyond the streets 
 These kids is always watchin' 
 Watching some of these jerks 
 When they go berserk

 That's what I call fightin the power 
 Here it is, no fable

 Identifyin who behind

 Who profit off the spit 
 Some of the same way same cats

 But slavery was too 
 Prison industrial complex 
 New slavery lookin' 
 To own you 
 Ownin the labels, stations, jails and cemeteries

 Turnin' hip hop into a one stop shop 
 Somebody behind 
 Makin' up your own damn mind 
 Signed, sealed delivered 
 In a nigger package 
 So dumb you can't hear

 By the backpacker 
 Who co-signed the say so 
 Claimin they dug the flow 
 Filled wit Jim Crow 
 Return of the old negro 
 How you gonna say no to drugs 
 If you don't say no to thugs

 We was raised in these streets on pork and poison meat 
 Now I recognize the beast and bare the mark of the gold teeth 
 Puff on the rolled leaf and bust on the police 
 While y'all playas are fakin bacon we cook the whole beef. 
 I put it down plain, I stimulate the left and right brain 
 Cell by cell and frame by frame. 
 Names, dates, are all inmaterial. I big dick sick ryhme killer like cereal. i 
 Burn like venerial, and spit that imperial wizardry that climbs right through 
 The curcitry. 
 Choake your team for their cream but that's as far as we go 
 Drop shit like seaguls and smash your little ego. 
 I get visions like stevie and coleco, 
 Give me 2000 live people 
 One late show no seaquel. 
 Ain't no equal in the flesh 
 I been through more evil than men do. 
 Nasty off the head and with the pen too!

 Easy to rhyme on tracks like this 
 The more things change 
 The more they remain the same 
 These games them vidiots 
 Playin' on the brink of insane 
 Must be a hockey rink 
 Lost in their drink 
 In pursuit of plain jane 
 I think man they think a revolution be pretty in pink 
 Now in these new tracks 
 Some of these cats don't know how to act 
 All them criminal acts ain't got nuttin to do wit rap 
 One hand cuffuffed behind them backs in black 
 Quiet riot, y'all can't hear one hand clap

 Of society to society 
 Together we got 100 years of sobriety

 Turned out 
 They happy just to be in the house 
 So I'm a call emout 
 I ain't no church mouse

 Write a 16 and half of that 
 Then eat some mix greens after that

 L y should get into the ""sy""

 He get's more love than tennis 
 On the road to riches 
 Cause revolutions expensive 
 Finance whips. finance clips spend our chips 
 In the ghetto raising rebelz with some fine azz tits. 
 No champagne no campaign no ice on my wrist 
 While bred'z dipp'n on fedz sipp'n on crys 
 Out of my mind ethiopian wine on my lips

 I give a damn 
 Cause damn is ya baby gone 
 Do whatcha wanna do 
 But try to do the right thing 
 If it's the right thing 
 Then go on 
 Do the damn thing 
 I know you get soul 
 Like a bbq chicken wing 
 Thet me like a king 
 Lemme hear you sing 
 Money can't buy you love 
 Thought you knew that 
 Eight days a week 
 Livin' like a rugrat 
 Sex machine can't face fact 
 Gotta chase the cat 
 Hear the hand claps 
 Turn the damn thing up 
 Here we go again 
 No means no 
 So now you know again 
 Flow it like a poet 
 Get ready then 
 Dance gotcha trembin in dem timberland 
 Jumpback poppin' that track 
 Gonna shake it now 
 Check the cat 
 Gettin' wreck gonna break it down the record now 
 Gotta break it down 
 Rhymin this flow on the go 
 C'mon get it now 
 Yeah... 
 I'm saying we went from Gods to niggas 
 From queens to bitches 
 Who in the hell told you that you were in heaven 
 Who in the hell told you that you were in heaven 
 Platinum gold a house and a car 
 But poverty all around you by far 
 People living under bridges or in a car 
 Heaven for the super rich who call it modern living 
 But the Man from the east calls it a wilderness 
 Cause heaven for whites is hell for blacks in America 
 Heaven and hell are two conditions of Life 
 Not a place up there or a place down there 
 It's a condition of life on earth so value Life 
 Heaven is not things 
 It's a higher level of thinking 
 And at the moment one may change the conditions of Life 
 Our people think a job, partying and endless flow of women and moet, 
 Krystal and how much sex you can have is heaven 
 Sometimes you got to think that it may not be heaven all the time 
 But being able to meet Life's struggles head on, head on, head on 
 Without compromising your Soul soul soul soul 
 In this worlds Life 
 Not Life after death 
 Life on earth 
 Life 
 Not worrying about how you are gonna eat or put clothes on your children 
 Sit yourself in heaven at once 
 A woman is a very important part of heaven 
 She produces heaven with you 
 And if she is connected to the source of Life 
 So heaven is a condition of Life 
 And you can have it on earth 
 So value life 
 Value life 
 Who in the hell told y'all you were in heaven 
 Oh, Oh 
 Lord Have Mercy!"
130,Public Enemy,hiphop,Air Conditioning,"The same song heard over 
 Over and over 
 And over and over 
 And over and over 
 Gotta tell me why the hell they got a mars rover 
 When much of arizona 
 Still can't grow a 
 Thing in dirt 
 I'm hurt 
 You don't know solomon burke 
 Or james brown did work 
 Or the son of bazerk 
 Ike turner beats 
 Before he got meaner wit tina 
 When times were leaner 
 Cats did six shows 
 Horne at the appollo, holla 
 Dyamite shows below 5 dollars 
 Sax machines 
 Don't be so mean 
 Heard were trumpets 
 C'mon can you jump it 
 Off over the atlantic 
 Took the soul for granted 
 Air stole the soul like a bandit 
 Conditioning 
 Motown stax 
 Put the soul to rest 
 Chess put the blues up in that chest 
 Sex shops 
 Backdrops 
 Joe tex beats 
 In the middle of hip hop 
 Get 'em out them seats 
 Fast cars and faster women 
 Take 'em to the limit 
 The poetry of money 
 Taking names down wit it 
 Sayinno to techno 
 Beat it up too quick 
 Dark chords livin' on a 
 Sick guitar lick 
 Mutated, faded, now I'm feelin' fela 
 Hate I can't find it without radar 
 Cross fader crossed over 
 Caught in the chaos 
 Can't hear want cause it costs some dollars 
 And the air snatched the soul and we abandoned 
 I think somebody planned it 
 Conditioning 
 Please, please, please 
 Soul don't grow on trees 
 Why a blues show 
 Very few blacks show 
 White folks 
 From the front to the back row 
 We know what we know from the radio 
 Jazz show even a rap show 
 Can still be no black show 
 Hot or not depends on the video 
 James brown 
 In town 
 Still few of us around 
 They don't even know flash 
 From another shakin ass 
 Bet some cash 
 Soul is dissapearin fast 
 Dancehalls sorry 
 They ain't hardly bob marley 
 Get that soul back on tracks 
 Tighten up 
 Don't always make them lyrics lighten up 
 If the soul y'all feelin', lemme hear you say yeah 
 Don't you feel it in the air 
 Conditioning"
131,Public Enemy,hiphop,Who's Your Hero,"Chuck d 
 And I'm a keep on spreadin 
 Them names of livin' and dead legends 
 Till armageddon 
 I save 'n' support those makin' a livin' 
 Against those makin' a killing 
 Uh, I crush the villain 
 Diametrically opposed 
 My minds able to leap and beatdown 
 All the clowns in a single bound 
 I'm fit for some comic strip 
 Save the silenced 
 From punks drunk off the threat of violence 
 My secret identity 
 I'm hated for what I am 
 Instead of loved for what I'm not 
 Damn I'm a man 
 Not judged by what I got 
 If rap games like a sport 
 Who the hell cares what I bought? 
 This is chuck no car here to snatch up and bag up 
 Ignorance no matter where it is 
 No matter where you are 
 Bulls on parade I rain on that charade 
 Played in the shame 
 This heroes a deeper shade 
 Now why wouldn't I be cantankerous? 
 At this stage and age 
 I be spinnin like a 45 
 Video chicks the reason 
 They peep them flicks 
 Villian seed implanted 
 So they take it for granted 
 In order to lead the people 
 You gotta love the people 
 To save the people 
 You must serve the people 
 To teach the people 
 You better reach the people 
 But only if you care, yo 
 Whos your hero? 
 Evil suits and ties attemptin to try 
 To flip the impressionable scripts of masterminds 
 Feels like a jungle sometimes 
 Makes me wonder 
 Is rap the new co intelpro 
 Makin' us all go under 
 Sounds of criminal thunder 
 Call it my hate that's stoppin' ya 
 I'm too old to be popular 
 I ain't faster than no speeding bullet 
 I can't fly 
 And I damn sure ain't high 
 You wanna know why 
 A page from 69 
 Peace 
 And that don't mean no crooked police 
 Avoid that pork at all costs 
 And them ol beefs 
 Cause is fuel for the motor 
 Foolin you to fill the quota 
 That's why I hate that scarface flick 
 Not brad jordan 
 But that al pacino shirt you sportin 
 Yeah I said it 
 Perhaps you ain't read it 
 If you was black or brown 
 Your ass damn sure wouldn't be down 
 Too many clowns promoting 
 Criminal backgrounds 
 Using crime like sugar 
 To get them kids hyper 
 These new pied pipers 
 Is the new co-intelpro 
 Whos your hero? 
 Try for the money 
 Even die for the money 
 Cry for the money 
 'Cause they 
 Try for the money 
 Even die for the money 
 Cry for the money 
 I paid attention way back when 
 Krs one said loves gonna getcha 
 So it stuck in my kitchen 
 So many cats switchin 
 To get on that old road to riches 
 Stupid talkin' bout snitchin 
 Whole lotta killin' 
 With the so called bling 
 Hides the villain 
 Twisted thuggin' into lovin' 
 Just to get her 
 Supported by mixtape djs 
 Who supposed to know better 
 Time for some action 
 Against the whippings of mass distraction"

 To get 'em in a daze 
 Same ol ways

 Programmed by the man

 Till it past tomorrow 
 See 'em fear it

 Guess it gotta come down to this... 
 In order to see things for what they are and what they is... 
 We still may not be free up in this piece or treated very equally as

136,Public Enemy,hiphop,Hard Rhymin',"Hard Truth Soldier radio 
 (Sister Souljah) 
 Brothers and sisters, this is not a test 
 I've been asked by Public Enemy leader Chuck D to make this emergency 
 Announcement 
 The police in your cities, for all intents and purposes 
 Have declared open season on black people (hey yo check one two) 
 Public Enemy was driven into the underground by government forces 
 However a small resistance is forming 
 Both Terminator X and Chuck D have resurfaced 
 Leading a small mobile rebel unit, ""The Valley of the Jeep Beats"" (1-2-3-4-5-6) 
 (Chuck D) 
 Hard rhyme and the rebel is on the mic 
 One time, rhyme animal's on the mic 
 They're still keepin', youth asleep an' 
 We in the hood with heat and still beatin' 
 And we back with the rap that packs the room 
 Black tracks with the rhythm that make you move 
 Can't hush the bumrush, we bust the sound 
 With these sonic bombs, feel the pressure all around 
 Raise the level I'm up again rhymin 
 Ridin' on the devil since I began rhymin 
 Hell we bring back the meat that rap lacks 
 Cause like I said, we got sold down the river 
 And I ain't for these racist wars 
 A lie's fed by these TV whores 
 I know it's more to news fake the truth 
 We break through won't lose we move with Public Enemy 
 (Chorus 2X: Chuck D) + (Paris) 
 Hard rhyme when the rebel is on the mic 
 One time rhyme animal's on the mic 
 (It's P.E. - whattup - it's on you, brother what'chu wanna do) 
 (Brother tell me if it's on, it's on) 
 (Chuck D) 
 Now hip-hop was a gift that lifted up 
 Loved rap till the companies ripped it up 
 Now the soul is set, we've been had like jazz 
 If you down for change then they take your voice away 
 And then they tell you the best is white 
 Co-signed by a nigga that pimped the mic 
 Make the rule the view that the beef is cool 
 But what it do is fool the few fools who buy the feud 
 Keep the people all blind and dumb dancin 
 Never let a record that wreck become rampant 
 See the street copycat the crap rap and songs 
 Not knowin' ""There's a POISON Goin' On"" 
 Till the message revealed and I show 
 But you never get to hear it on the radio 
 Jack be nimble, Jack be quick, fuck Jack! 
 Bust that, squeeze, rewind the shit, c'mon 
 (Interlude - scratching and samples) 
 ""C'mon now!"" DJ Lord 
 ""Here we go again"" 
 ""C'mon now!"" Guerilla Funk 
 (Hey yo check one..) 
 (Chuck D) 
 We move as a team to keep them demons out 
 Y'all know what I'm talkin' about 
 See 'em used, abused, confused us into thinkin' that 
 Bein ghetto mean the same as bein ignorant 
 And so we strive to rise and get by 
 No peace for the beast we police and shine the light 
 Culture vanish on the television pimpin' those 
 On ""Cribs"" in a home that they never own 
 Damn! Tell me that once again 
 Radio and the video don't uplift 
 Take a stand be demandin all my freedom and my civil rights 
 Worldwide fight the plan and they genocide 
 Yes the road is long and hard 
 And when I'm gone you'll say I did my part 
 Keep gunnin, we the crew that never lose 
 On the ones and the motherfuckin twos, Public Enemy 
 (Flavor Flav) 
 Hey yo check one two 
 Yeah that's right, Flavor Flav takin' you back to the next millineum 
 You know what I'm sayin'? Always cold cold kille-enum 
 You know what I'm sayin'? And I ain't playin' 
 It's all in the message that we're layin 
 I got a secret weapon, you know what I'm sayin'? 
 Let's take two steps to the rear, we gettin' out of here 
 You know what I'm sayin'? Operation Cold Killin' 'Em to the next millennium 
 Flavor Flav, rock the house 
 Hey yo check one two"
137,Public Enemy,hiphop,Rise,"(Flavor Flav) 
 Yeah that's right Chuck man, that's what you gotta do 
 You got to tell 'em JUST LIKE THAT, you know what I'm sayin'? 
 Cause yo, man let me tell you a little somethin' man 
 All these brothers around here fiendin for that crack-a-lack-a-lack 
 You dig what I'm sayin'? Yo man, all they wanna do is get what you got 
 But when you ain't got nuttin, then they wanna cut you off 
 So what you gotta do, you gotta play 'em long distance 
 You know what I'm sayin'? I mean long distance 
 They think we takin' shorts, show 'em this is Cold Medina man 
 C'mon, kick it! 
 (Chuck D) 
 Back one more time, here to put the message in a rough rhyme 
 It's important that you knowin' the time 
 'Cause I'm seein the program, know what I know and 
 Until we get together we will never be up for sure 
 So I wreck like I'm possessed by Malcolm X 
 See the feds want us dead, we too complex 
 I always speak the truth, comin' from me to you 
 We movin as a unit so you KNOW we refuse to lose 
 I got my eyes on the lies from Washington 
 I'm a survivor, I know how the West was won 
 See a show and tell, the way the CoIntel 
 Undermind the REAL hip-hop so the cops can trail 
 But know bad boys move in silence 
 Save us all from the pain of a life of violence 
 They tappin my phone, full grown and knowin' 
 And still prone to refute the lies, won't stop until we rise 
 (Chorus: Chuck D) + various samples 
 Rise up! ""C'mon, ah-c'mon"" 
 Rise... rise up! ""One more time"" 
 We rise... rise up! ""C'mon, ah-c'mon"" 
 Rise... rise up! ""To the beat y'all"" 
 (Chuck D) 
 I'm a hard truth soldier to the bone for change 
 Demonstrate and separate the fact from strange 
 Blame companies killin' our children 
 When the villain's on the record never think for a second that's the way we live 
 Wanna squeeze on the fleas at MTV 
 We quiz knots for the cops at BET 
 Seize the time, always rhymin combinin the antidote 
 For dope Interscope and fake gangster quotes 
 'Cause I can recollect times when records set 
 Collect a dead brother you mind if you silence it yet 
 Rest the program, defeat the beastie 
 Cause on the street they do as we influenced by what we see 
 And yes it ""Weighs a Ton"" I say it once again 
 That's why the Enemy is down with Paris and KAM 
 It's all fam, we collide we live 
 Better decide on which side you ride, won't stop until we rise 
 (Flavor Flav) 
 Y'all don't know, y'all don't know uh {*4X*} 
 (Chuck D) 
 I know the power of fame, ain't never playin' no games 
 Never croonin is provin, that we ready for change 
 Never simpin but they pimpin' my people, for the dollars 
 So I holla back it keep us from EVIL till them devils are collared 
 And like I said it's on, I say it once again 
 Better know the plan to keep us ignorant 
 Brother to brother, ain't no other can smother 
 Or erase my case, we marry words with BASS 
 Just another wicked rhyme that I'm rappin' on 
 S1's got my back if the clappin come 
 Pass on the work, makin' sure the words are known 
 Keep 'em nervous, make 'em understand we servin' foes 
 Keep it goin' strong, nevertheless, know the enemy 
 And never back down, you can take it to press 
 'Less the mic like the art dart told you before 
 We for the prize emphasis the fight, now c'mon and rise

138,Public Enemy,hiphop,Can't Hold Us Back,"[Malcolm X (sample)]: 
 Today we are together. We are unified and on runnin' cower. 
 When we are together, we got power 
 That is why we gathered today, celebratin' our own 
 We spit flows on foes 
 Listen to the message that ya never know 
 Got a plan for the man and it's federal 
 The rhyme animal, back to play the part again 
 Clear the madness - and put the message in 
 D the enemy is back to rip the mic 
 We come together - so don't believe the hype 
 Check my tone it's a war here at home 
 We united and strong - and never move alone 
 We rep justice, equality and freedom now 
 Put fam first, man woman and child 
 Never mild keep it hostile till we raise 
 Where we say what we mean and we mean what we say 
 It's been a long time coming that we mob as one 
 Guerrilla funk, hard truth and, that's what's up 
 No peace on the street till the justice come 
 From the ballot to the bullet, if it's on, it's on 
 I ain't lettin nothin' hold me back or block me, they gon' have to pop me to stop me, see 
 I ain't lettin nothin' hold me back or block me, they gon' have to pop me to stop me, believe 
 I ain't lettin nothin' hold me back or block me, they gon' have to pop me to stop me, my brother 
 I ain't lettin nothin' hold me back or block me, they gon' have to pop me to stop me, that's real talk on the one 
 Yo I'm a target I got proof, my building got an 'X' on it 
 Bloomberg threw the hex on it, 
 It's like a pistol with effects on it 
 On a brother with arrest warrants 
 Hittin' pigs in they in they chest quadrant where they vest wasn't 
 Now he dead cousin 
 All you snitches hit the red buttons, we some Uncle-Tom killas 
 Mini-nina concealers, political cap-peelers for this freedom fo' rilla 
 Yo if police stop the whip you got to eat them trees 
 I ain't got no 'G' to give to these coppers and court fees 
 You know my steez, security first, prepare for the worst 
 Never caught slippin' if you stay on alert 
 Malcolm X said send send 'em to the cemetery if they touch you 
 A revolutionary virtue - a dull blade'll hurt you 
 I'm up early workin' my machete 
 In war, it ain't no warning, you just got to be ready 
 I ain't lettin nothin' hold me back or block me, they gon' have to pop me to stop me, see 
 I ain't lettin nothin' hold me back or block me, they gon' have to pop me to stop me, believe 
 I ain't lettin nothin' hold me back or block me, they gon' have to pop me to stop me, my brother 
 I ain't lettin nothin' hold me back or block me, they gon' have to pop me to stop me, that's real talk on the one 
 It's bigger than rap- 
 You really think you gon' be left alone 
 On sayin' that you believe and ain't gon' have to get your scrap on? 
 Then yap on, and will see if that's the right route 
 While I get my clap on and turn snitches lights out 
 I tried to be nice, now we gon' have to bleed 'em 
 I'm willing to do a killin' for the price of freedom 
 Comin' from the left, brother, hood is how we kept it 
 So prison or death is just something I done accepted 
 So we'll murder a snake, and we'll kill a skunk 
 This ain't the word of a fake, it's Guerrilla Funk 
 So right now is the time and your turf's the location 
 Y'all about to see the Rebirth Of a Nation 
 Even if some got de-rebelized 
 The revolution still will not be televised 
 U.S. Government tellin' hella lies 
 And it's evident when you look in this president's devil eyes 
 I ain't lettin nothin' hold me back or block me, they gon' have to pop me to stop me, see 
 I ain't lettin nothin' hold me back or block me, they gon' have to pop me to stop me, believe 
 I ain't lettin nothin' hold me back or block me, they gon' have to pop me to stop me, my brother 
 I ain't lettin nothin' hold me back or block me, they gon' have to pop me to stop me, that's real talk on the one

139,Public Enemy,hiphop,Hard Truth Soldiers,"(Verse 1: Chuck D) 
 Bring that beat back, we set it off ""we set it off"" 
 Got us back for combat, we get it raw ""we get it raw"" 
 With a counterattack over tracks we build minds of the blind 
 Never calm when we bomb on neocons ""let's go"" 
 Pump the level, the rebel to you 
 Never lose or let a devil break up my crew 
 Never nervous, serve 'em with the words with purpose it's the 
 CoIntel killa black hard truth silverback ""damn"" 
 Still checkin' to see just who's set to come along 
 When brothers revive that movement 
 We bringing the balance back, never non-violent tact 
 Guerrillla Funk and P.E. connect 
 So know it when you're hearin the rhymes that I'm givin' 'em 
 Combined with the rhythmn designed to expose the sins 
 All in it's the master plan 
 Until the curse is reversed I'm sayin', rebirth of a nation... 
 (Verse 2: Professor Griff) 
 They call me E-M-E, U-N-O, you know 
 P.A., niggaz is opposite of the Po Po 
 We say together the ants can conquer the elephants 
 They say, fuck what they say 'cause shit is irrelevant 
 Soldiers, where's your heart? Show me that love 
 What you made of? This is the shit that could make thugs 
 Turn revolutionary, 360 he with me she with me 
 Anything for you, give up my kidney... 
 (Verse 3: Dead Prez) 
 Up early in the morning, training with the machete 
 Revolutionary, ready for war, never scary 
 As an African, my daily regimen is development 
 Malcolm X said self defense is intelligent 
 So I train in the martial arts 
 It's something for warriors, not those with partial hearts ""partial hearts"" 
 We recognize that our people need a military 
 So we could take care what's already necessary...

 It's the killa Cal nigga now, showin' disgust 
 One hitter, still bitter, clips ready to bust 
 Gat Turner with the twin burner 21 shots in my drawz 
 Red beam on a pig make 'em pause 
 And y'all can't fuck with the style I bring 
 Been wild as a child ever since I came 
 To the knowledge of myself, raise 'em up, maintain 
 P-Dog and the Enemy, we bringin' the pain... 
 (Verse 5: Conscious Daughters) 
 It's the squaw, quick on the draw and quite clean 
 Verbal attack, I'm never seen, comin' 
 Niggas take off runnin', they know in my tribe 
 I'm pitchin' venomous arrows and shovin' bitches aside 
 We ride, unified, playin' our part 
 Bein' sure that a woman's voice'll never get lost 
 Still a soldier in the struggle and aware of the cost 
 Motherfucker, thought you knew the people ready for war... 
 So before I begin, let's commit to rhyme 
 Keep the women in the mix and do it one more time 
 And that when I get to hittin', know the powder is dry 
 Spittin' 'power to the people', hoe, the real gon' shine 
 Conscious Daughters in the front, soldier first brigade 
 Special One, CMG, Guerrilla Funk, we raid 
 Blaze through the competition and we all get paid 
 But keep it revolutionary each and every day...

 Who that nigga you can call to spit some shit 
 And ain't scared of the government, you niggaz lovin' it 
 We spread out in different positions 
 Tryin' to break these motherfuckers outta prison, listen ""yeah"" 
 Mayday on the front line 
 Nigga we G's up in the game, we bust till we flatline ""what"" 
 Then they want my black ass to Rock The Vote 
 They want as many niggaz they can to fill the boat 
 But these house niggaz go fight in Iraq 
 Cryin' to they mamma now they wanna come back 
 Should'nta took your black ass in the service

 (Malcolm X) 
 Being here in America doesn't make you an American 
 Being born here in America doesn't make you an American 
 Why if birth made you an American you wouldn't need any legislation 
 You wouldn't need any amendments to the Constitution 
 I don't see any American dream, I see an American nightmare 
 I'm one of the 42 million black people who are the victims of America 
 (Paris) 
 Aiyyo we all in together now, all in together now 
 Hard truth soldierin, hard truth soldier SHIT 
 Keep on servin' 'em, cause you know we do work 
 Mashin in my Chevy down the streets of New York, they feel me 
 I smooth grip, and hit up the spot 
 Snatch Flav as my dual pipes burn up the block 
 We bumpin hardcore, heavyweight, b-boy blast 
 On the street they hear my beat, my 69 is fast 
 Smash down Lennox, head up to the 'View 
 Some reporter wanna holla and I said it was cool 
 Wanna know about the album and the Enemy's new 
 How P.E. and Guerilla Funk is keepin' it movin 
 Breakin bread talkin' politics, you know how it go 
 'Bout the war and how it's shitty that we murder for dough 
 Then the reporter asked a question, that I had to mash 
 How, I would act if every day was maybe my last 
 How if every day I worried 'bout my family in this 
 I'd be murdered on these street in a puddle of piss 
 Or if I would get some news that my brother had died 
 If they ran up in my house and held my kids and my wife 
 Or if we was looted and somebody took all our thangs 
 If my sister was abducted, never heard from again 
 I began to compare it, so he could observe 
 When I made the parallels with how they livin' abroad 
 I can't ignore it, these pigs ride deep in the streets 
 Cap a nigga for his wallet, beat another for free 
 And the cold part about it, life is cheaper than that 
 Down there people on the bottom kill each other for scraps 
 Imagine that, propaganda got the people confused 
 Damned by the media that keep 'em subdued 
 I been around the world, seen a lot of shit in my life 
 Same sirens, same ghetto birds swirlin at night 
 Same racism, profilin each of us all 
 Same outsiders where we live enforcin the law 
 Gats clappin on the streets, gunplayin with heat 
 Same prisons full of brothers herded in like sheep 
 Same turncoats that'll burn folks for pay 
 Same conditions in communities we die everyday 
 Same brutality and ignorance, now what will it take 
 To break the motherfuckin cycle, get the people away? 
 That's why I'm fresh out of tears for 'em, all out of tears for 'em 
 Even though my heart goes out, what the fuck you cryin 'bout? 
 Money for rebuilding but, what about home? 
 When the way we live is shitty where's the love for our own? 
 I can't decide it, it's real, I hit you with proof 
 Maybe I'll be suicided 'cause I hit you with truth 
 See they kill for less than what we say on records to you 
 Hear the message in the music from a rebel to you, now listen

 For the brothers in the pen and the women despised 
 For all the people's pain from the brain control

 Hope goes to the folks don't hold the max 
 And the ten percent blood suckin askin blacks 
 To pass the gat, and snatch that book off the shelf

 Don't trip when the real clip rip the club

 Ain't that a bitch, I heard somebody think 
 Rap is dead cause people runnin' out of shit to say 
 So ridiculous and so absurd 
 I was almost at a loss for words, then I started to serve 
 Off the line of the Enemy's mind 
 Back in 2005 droppin' hammers without the time 
 Bring the ruckus from the booth to the hood 
 Motherfucker cause it ain't all good, now I wish they would 
 Get yo' vest on, we rain on Babylon 
 The anti-Fox News, anti-pop, original group 
 P and the Enemy policin the beast 
 Until we rise it'll never be peace, I put that on Jesus 
 Back with vocals, no whack shit, no glory focus 
 No gimmick tracks, just hard truth and rough raps 
 Plus that gear that keep 'em fearin the crime 
 Makin' sure brothers knowin' the time, that's why it ain't no smilin' 
 See the army as they're snatchin us up, yeah 
 At yo' high school, promisin what? 
 Better recognize the bling of the murder machine 
 That's why it's meaning in the words when we serve and ask you to think 
 Who the whores that embed with the swords 
 Who the ones pimp us all sellin death for Murder Dog

 The death penalty but call abortion murder for sport 
 For the fake patri-OT, ain't no questions asked 
 'Specially, when the babies kill each other for gas

 Still undereducated, makin' minimum wage

 Her whole body would look the way she thought it should 
 They shake a splatter of fat and move from this to that 
 Like Frankenstein but blind because it's in her mind 
 Don't know what she felt, or why she hated herself 
 Maybe dolls and shows, or maybe videos 
 Now it's plain to see, the girl loves TV 
 Because she's chasin a dream we know can never be 
 Was all part of the plan to keep her lookin' right 
 Thinkin' she could be Janet, if she took the knife 
 It's not a sin to be thin, she tryin' hard to fit in 
 Knowin' soon she'll be a citizen, of the Plastic Nation 
 (Chorus 2X: conversation between women and plastic surgeon) 
 Tell me what you don't like about yourself 
 I wanna change my face, and I wanna change my body, I wanna change my body 
 Tell me what you don't like about yourself 
 I wanna change my face, it would be so... great 
 (Chuck D) 
 Now she was more crazy than lazy till she had a baby 
 Tryin' to move and improve upon on what God gave her 
 Just like the swan she thought she had it goin' on 
 But never once thought it was wrong or that it wouldn't save her 
 Went to the clinic was in it for over half a day 
 As they sliced and diced and put the parts in place 
 Her body's bruised, abused, cause her mind's confused 
 Bent on livin' a lie but never satisfied 
 And you know it ain't right, that's somebody's daughter 
 Now her face is so tight that you can bounce a quarter 
 And the feeling ain't back, they said it'll never be back 
 She's a creature with features, broken out of order 
 That's why we try to find a way to get inside 
 And make you love your life and never need the knife 
 It's not a sin to be thin, don't need to bleed to fit in 
 Now she's another citizen, of the Plastic Nation 
 (Women talking to end) 
 I need liposuction 
 I'd like bigger calves 
 I need liposuction 
 And, I'd also like to go up to a C cup 
 Tell me what you don't like about yourself 
 Maybe I could have her ears 
 Maybe I could have her ears, and I like her nose 
 Tell me what you don't like about yourself 
 Because they don't stick out like ours does see 
 {*Suction sounds*}"
146,Public Enemy,hiphop,Coinsequences,"(Intro/Chorus: Paris) 
 Is it a, coincidence that we ain't taught truth 
 A, coincidence that they target the youth 
 A, coincidence everything is the same 
 That a message in the music ain't a part of the game 
 A, coincidence that we livin' a lie 
 A, coincidence that we only get by 
 A, coincidence that so many are lost 
 And do prison time 'fore we notice the cost 
 (Paris) 
 It really ain't difficult to break the mold 
 And take a close look at the lies we're told 
 Wipe away the facade, see we got to know 
 See the plot to control and to rot the soul 
 You can make anybody that don't read believe 
 Anything that they see on the TV screen 
 That a lie is reality, the sky is green 
 That there's weapons in Iraq, and the President's clean 
 When it's on, thinkin' you can trust police 
 Every black is a beast and our women are cheap 
 And that brothers gettin' murdered is the way of the streets 
 That it's normal to die when we still in our teens 
 And that's the way it is, what's the use to try 
 That school is a motherfuckin waste of time 
 Slang yay, die young, maybe get rich rhymin 
 And prison if you black is just a part of life 
 And that all of America support the Pres' 
 Religion is the way, and we all full of sin 
 That it's better after death if we suffer and pray 
 Even though they fuck us off in this life today 
 And that white Jesus hangin' on the wall in church 
 Ain't a part of a lie to keep a brother subservient 
 And that the whole world need the word ""Amen"" 
 Got troops overseas gettin' murdered for free 
 If you buy that shit, I got a bridge to sell 
 Like I said I'm a rebel, so I must re-bel 
 And lies be the truth now, war is peace 
 Like corporations don't dictate the streets 
 Like brothers don't die for the diamond or bling 
 Like brothers don't die over songs we sing 
 Like patri-ots act like the Patriot Act 
 While we swing on this bitch till we break it in half 
 (Paris) 
 You guilty if arrested and niggaz are thugs 
 Only good for welfare, murder and drugs 
 The media is true, with no bias at all 
 And Fox News ain't on the President's balls 
 That Lacey and O.J. and Kobe and Mike 
 Ain't bullshit and really do matter in life 
 That you shouldn't be insulted they give 'em the time 
 But never talk about all this corporate crime 
 That they generatin news stay loose with facts 
 Relate fake views that'll keep us attracted 
 Like sheep so we don't think, never react 
 Never question authority, never suspect 
 Never trip off of why what matters to us 
 Always seem unimportant, and never get love 
 Why it's never any money for the school support 
 But it's fallin' out the sky for these corporate wars 
 (Paris) 
 They never give real shit space to shine 
 Just donkey-ass niggaz on assembly line 
 Cookie cutter pop-slutter make music designed 
 To pedal Coca-Cola, Motorola and Sprite 
 No love for the Enemy with video play 
 But they give Flav a show to take the focus away 
 From the realest group ever made, whaddya say 
 When to them it's Eminem that's goin' down as the greatest? 
 When the plan is a shame like we makin' a choice 
 Understand it's a scam who get handed a voice 
 And it's only a few and they decide in advance 
 Like votin for the President and both of them fam 
 All that ""God bless America, and nobody else"" 
 But I can smell racism, however it's dealt 
 Know the real shit never miss, see how it's felt 
 All around the world, hear the people cryin for help 
 (Outro: Paris) 
 A, coincidence ex-cons can't vote 
 A, coincidence they can't get no work 
 A, coincidence that they can't hold heat 
 Now they know that they enemy don't look like me 
 A, coincidence that we shit out of luck 
 The consequence of coincidences all add up 
 When you never know the reason and you're set up to suffer 
 The offense is coincidence is never the cause"
147,Public Enemy,hiphop,Invisible Man,"(Chuck D) + (Flavor Flav) 
 I came from a place I forgot 
 I woke up in the parking lot, far from a meal and a cot 
 On the corner where all the streets got the same name 
 Maybe my brain's on the brink of (INSANE!) 
 Pain between the papers while sleepin' on the train 
 This the land of milk and honey (know what I'm sayin'?!) 
 The invisible man times three 
 Black, down and out - out standin on a corner (no doubt) 
 Now a nation of homeless sleepin' in bus stations 
 Another win for the pilgrims who said (NO MORE HAITIANS) 
 As I proceed, someone to feed me is what I need 
 (Three blocks of dealers tryin' to hit me off with some weed) 
 Yeah, avenues and boulevards hungry as a (FUCKER) 
 Hope to get a ride from a (TRUCKER - aiyyo man) 
 Everybody know I ain't no (SUCKER) 
 Every time I used to drop thirty at the (RUCKER - that's it) 
 Away from the crazy kids in Generation Wrecked 
 Dissin pyramids while praisin projects 
 (Walk past old folks gettin' no respect!) 
 Callin young folks a bunch a no-good rejects 
 And I walk on 
 (Chorus: Chuck D) 
 An eye for an eye, I can't recognize the man in the mirror 
 Is it I? It is I 
 Now who this cat I'm lookin' at? 
 'Cause I've been waitin so long, to get where I'm goin' 
 An eye for a eye, in this country 'tis of thee 
 Now how the hell, can I be free 
 And who this cat I'm lookin' at? 
 'Cause I've been lost so long without anybody knowin' 
 (Chuck D) + (Flavor Flav) 
 So I move on (uh-huh) and I walk on (yeah-yeah!) 
 Past the preachers and the pimps gettin' their talk on (SAY WORD?!) 
 Why do home gotta be where the negative roam 
 To be or not to be (so I roll alone) 
 I'm trapped within, this skin and these bones 
 Amongst temporary kings, on cellular phones 
 Can I last, as I walk past 
 Mad cigarette billboards, and malt liquor ads 
 (Walkin' on da bottles and potato chip bags) 
 Everyone I see got the nerve to brag 
 Where they from, what they got, and don't own squat 
 Disrespect where they from and you might get shot {*click click BOOM*} 
 Zombies askin me, what the latest bomb be 
 (You shoulda shot the fuckin' sheriff and the fuckin' deputy G!) 
 For okayin the drug trade and lettin it be 
 But I know prison for me, is an industry 
 So I walk, heard the best things in life be free 
 (Didn't God make this land and the air that we breathe) 
 Not for the homeless, don't give a damn about me 
 In the mirror somebody else is starin' at me 
 Maybe prison is the skin I'm within 
 All this time I been sufferin can't fix it with a Bufferin 
 Plus they said I'll never work in this town again (God damn!) 
 So I keep on walkin' - yeah 
 (Chuck D) + (Flavor Flav) 
 Lil' DayDay is Big Day and just did time 
 Seen him standin (on the unemployment line?!) 
 Which collided with the line of the health clinic 
 I seen Crazy Stacy, her ass standin up in it 
 No more welfare, they cut her Medicaid 
 (DAMN! My momma used to do her braids) 
 I keep walkin', so they don't see me 
 But I doubt if they doin' much better than me 
 So I walk on, never take the planet for granted 
 I paved the concrete, asphalt and granite 
 I walked past three brothers, sittin' on the porch 
 With a yard of dirt, and littered with Newports 
 Talkin' how they comin' up while they sittin' on they ass 
 As I walk past 'em I'm the target of they laughs 
 And one said ""Let's get him for his fuckin' stash"" 
 As I walked fast, past the other yards with grass 
 Had a little cash, I tried to make it last 
 From a few deals I made from cleanin windshields 
 I ran like a (rally) they caught me in the (alley) 
 Can't get out the ghetto from New York to (Cali) 
 I thought I had nothin', till I felt the knife 
 And now I ain't even got a life... {*echoes*}"

 Once upon a time, not long ago 
 A rapper got shot, and no one knows 
 Who pulled the trigga on the kid and laid him in his grave 
 And after the prayers and the street parade 
 Shit got forgot, and now he's dead 
 And all the fans loved everything he said 
 So understand this, you don't wanna miss 
 Sex, drugs, and violence 
 We like those gangsta rhymes... 
 Just make sure they don't corrupt our minds... 
 These rappers kill and thieve... 
 A lot of times it's only make believe... 
 (KRS-One) 
 Ayo once upon a time in Jamaica, Queens 
 An icon gets shot and no one knew what it means 
 It was just another murder scene 
 But let's get on with the bling bling 
 Ching ching and half naked chicks that can't sing 
 Murder weapon, never found. Police, never around 
 The respect, the intellect, and the suspect all out of town 
 It's all out of bounds. KRS, Chuck D makin' our rounds, man 
 While they takin' us down, man 
 We're takin' you down. I got another new sound 
 It's really an old sound, but you know how me and Chuck get down 
 We got peace, love, unity, and having the fun 
 But you all want sex, drugs, violence 101 
 Here it is... Bam 
 Stop being a little boy with a little toy, stand up and be a man 
 Now you see the plan, from west to east 
 Instead of sex, drugs, and violence we got love, purpose, and peace 
 We be hurtin' the least. We be workin, no seats 
 Bringing it to America like Geronimo and Cochise 
 Get that, but make sure when you spit rap 
 If you ain't really ready to die, yo, don't spit that! 
 We like those gangsta rhymes... 
 Just make sure they don't corrupt our minds... 
 These rappers kill and thieve... 
 A lot of times it's only make believe... 
 (Flavor Flav) 
 Once upon a time I was on Long Island 
 A man got shot and he wasn't smilin' 
 He was bleedin' from his guts, yo 
 A policeman was sittin' and he drove up on the spot, yo 
 Now when police light came on 
 When the man died, who was the blame on? 
 Wasn't me. Not you 
 I didn't kill nobody 'cause my records don't do that 
 I make the records for the kids 
 Gangsta rap flippin' people's kids' lids 
 We like those gangsta rhymes... 
 Just make sure they don't corrupt our minds... 
 These rappers kill and thieve... 
 A lot of times it's only make believe..."

 No 2 earrings

 Chicks bobby socks today be Botox 
 Now that hip hops the 
 New so-called rock 
 Parents dressin the outside 
 Of their kids 
 An' what they wear 
 Instead of stressin the inside 
 Way back, my peoples gave me pride 
 Now in 2004 I ain't gotta hide 
 If you can't afford it just 
 Leave it to the side 
 'Cause you looking real 
 Stupid with that tear in your eye 
 Gotta a 1994 hear you talkin' 
 But it's damn sure better than walkin' 
 It might be old, it sure ain't gold 
 Better than stylin in the cold 
 It ain't no rolls, so wont get stoled 
 But you won't see me walking on 
 No side of the road 
 At the age I am now 
 If I can't teach 
 I shouldn't even open up my 
 Mouth begin to speak 
 I need some radio 
 To help me reach 
 But I heard they get their money on 
 By makin' you weak 
 Drowning in the sea of 
 Some big dose of now 
 No past no future 
 Let the young grow wild 
 Ain't gave 'em nuttin 
 Some done robbed the child 
 From substance 
 Don't currr, fill 'em up wit style 
 Like hip hop started on TRL, like wow 
 Took the game and made 
 It a gdamn shame 
 Hell wit history you don't even 
 Know my name 
 I ain't the same damn thing 
 That y'all used to playin' 
 I'm non-stop rocket 
 Headin to your brain 
 Now that's what I'm sayin' 
 I may not got no flow 
 But I ain't pimped by no negro 
 Backed by some 
 Cracka wit 
 His ass by the door 
 Therefore 
 I can never be poor 
 'Cause my mind, body, and soul 
 Cannot be sold 
 Priceless 
 So I avoid the trifelin 
 Worms in my cipher 
 Stuff y'all can't get enough off 
 Gots no time for 
 Somebody's jail 
 My time is just like the US mail 
 My time is richer 
 Than them new astro pitchers 
 I be damn if my face 
 Be under some picture 
 Where you heard the n-word 
 So save your liquid

 Find somebody new to get wit 
 The next time you hear a

 Stand or even

 Who's wild sayin' things like some juvenile

 Since ""Rebel without a Pause"" beats were never the same

 Only a pawn in the game 
 Chastised for namin names

 Praised the gangsta 
 Just because it sold 
 While consciousness 
 Went from platinum to gold 
 Seen a nation reduce ""Fight the Power"" to gin and juice 
 Some people gave it up and turned it loose. 
 Beethoven, Bach, Brahms 
 I want some James Brown 
 Even Bruce, Brian, Bono, Beck, yeah Chuck Berry 
 Prince, Stevie, Sly, Smokey, Johnny Cash in my Chevy 
 Heard some call me an Uncle Tom 
 Now that's petty 
 I'm a songwriter fool 
 I condense sense from right and wrong 
 Livin' in the key of protest songs 
 From basement tapes 
 Beyond them dollars and cents 
 Changin of the guards spent 
 Where the--went 
 Most of their time out of mind 
 Hatin' my mess age rhymes 
 Can't truss it, shut 'em down call it whatcha wanna 
 But they made a day fit for a king 
 By the time we got to Arizona 
 Tomorrow's a long time

 Be the same damn dog but to finer women?

 Sure they right but I'm trying to light a fire in them 
 'Cause I was raised by the enemy 
 And ever since then that's been my identity 
 So I'm trying to give back what's was given me 
 Truth told delivery is my tendency 
 Youth fold to the spirit of my energy 
 Bottom of my feet is something that you'll never see 
 That's 'cause I'm standing singing the anthem 
 Fist on my hand, and a list of demands and

 No need to dumb down to what I mention 
 No need to young down how I mention 
 In Spanish Portuguese English French and 
 No satisfaction

 America's still black and white 
 Like an old TV set 
 What we gonna do about it? 
 Laugh sit back forget and quit? 
 I get racial 
 Just talkin' about the ratio 
 People are no longer patient 
 Now the brown they don't want around

 And what you keep is what you owe 
 And what the people want to know

 And what you got is what they want 
 And what they see they say they need 
 And people bleeding from the greed 
 Now whose gonna catch the thrown? 
 (Chuck D) 
 Thrown at 
 Thrown under 
 Thrown to the side 
 Throwin' up disgusted 
 So were throwin' down 
 Thrown under the bus draggin on the 
 Ground 
 Power to the people salute the underground 
 Against those standing 
 In mansions 
 Spittin' at us from up that higher ground 
 Feed the people 
 Fight the power 
 Fix the poor 
 But that 1% done shut the door 
 In god we trust on money 
 Is a slap in the face 
 To the rest of the whole human race 
 Post racial wealth and taste 
 Change a name 
 But you can't change race in the united states 
 People say they kings 
 Plus say they're queens 
 If we all don't eat 
 What does it all mean? 
 We watch and listen 
 But I'll leave it alone 
 But who's gonna catch the thrown? 
 What you reap is what you sow 
 And what you keep is what you owe

 Divide and conquer 
 Oldest trick in the game 
 War between people who are really the same 
 As the rich get richer 
 The poor get bitchin 
 The people keep kissin' 
 The feds don't listen 
 This recession seen a black depression 
 In a nation headed for desperation 
 No quarterback and sacked on a couch 
 Sound of black America is ouch 
 Governments don't love you 
 When prisons and executions 
 End up looking like some final solutions 
 Murder is an institution 
 Backed up and hacked up 
 By some handwritten constitution 
 Do what you do 
 Buddhist Christian Hindu Muslim and Hebrew 
 You are what you do 
 I be seein human beings as stew 
 Yet never have so many been screwed by so few 
 We watch the kings and queens 
 And what they own 
 But 
 Who's gonna catch the thrown? 
 (Cormega) 
 The system is designed to incriminate 
 Genocide was devolved to eliminate 
 Equality is a myth 
 They had me in jail for a crime I didn't even commit 
 A stereotype 
 They feel every color is inferior right 
 Brothers who resist are considered a threat 
 From sitting bull to Malcolm X 
 In the land of the free and suspect elections 
 John Kennedy had the mob connections 
 President Reagan sold guns to Iraq 
 Yet they try to say that criminals are all black 
 What's up with these corrupt politicians 
 And drugs they be shipping 
 But they never go to prison 
 This fucked up system better never try to bag me 
 Fuck zimmerman, guilty 
 Clearly 
 Catch the thrown, you got to testify 
 Is that the 1% that you need says that you occupy 
 Catch the thrown I got ta testify 
 Is that the 1% that y'all want says that you occupy

 Free the mind prisoners 
 They ain't listening 
 F the popo 
 But who dat whistling? 
 Foes making a killing 
 Juxtaposed against those getting a livin' 
 Gimme shelter cause these issues be official 
 Is the need to feed 
 Replaced by the greed? 
 I ain't trying to yell at you 
 Sell to you 
 Some b's they already told to you 
 Ended up being sold to you 
 Did I mention? 
 Cheapest price is to pay attention 
 Now the test is just being at your best 
 With that you can 
 Hold your own 
 But who's gonna catch the thrown?"

 A game of life is what I'm sayin' 
 Split 'em up call them names 
 At the age I am if I can't teach 
 I shouldn't open my mouth to speak 
 Talking loud and sayin' nothing 
 And frontin like they doin' something 
 Feel the people 
 Heal the people 
 Power goes out 
 To the people 
 18-35 is grown 
 Can't afford to leave the home 
 Can't afford to buy a home 
 Can't afford to keep a home 
 Boarded up foreclosed cribs 
 Based on whatcha bank did 
 Yet see these guys advertise to the poor for clothes 
 The doors are closed 
 They slam the doors on your nose 
 Who the hell is telling you 
 What the hell they selling you 
 Why the hell do you believe 
 Where we headed when we leave 
 WTF? 
 WTF? 
 WTF? 
 (Flavor Flav) 
 From Barack Obama to Flavor Flav 
 We both be a first till we get to our grave 
 I'm the first hype man in music 
 He's the first black president 
 He's the first black resident 
 To be ever come president 
 Free your mind your ass will follow 
 Flavor Flav all the way to the Apollo 
 Freeport li to la 
 Throw a Frito Olay off the dock of the bay 
 You wanna know why a kid goes to school? 
 And in his book-bag he carries a tool 
 Because he's trying to be like his idols in the streets 
 Gang warfare to the raw fare 
 Don't even try to go up there 
 Penalties that you can't bear 
 You lose your sight your ass can't hear 
 It weighs so much it'll crush your life 
 Don't play with god he gave you live 
 The last man standing he hopes to behold 
 His weight in stature his weight in gold 
 What goes in your wash comes out in your rinse 
 Back down so tight that you call it condensed 
 Can't stand the pressure, can't stand the pain 
 My life is so dry I wish it would rain 
 Just like the temptations not just the singing group 
 I'm here to tell you now so don't ignore the scoop 
 I been in this rap game for 25 years 
 If we made the rock and roll hall of fame 
 We deserve our chairs 
 To what we fought the power to who stole the soul 
 Brothers gonna work it out 
 From the ground we hold 
 God says to man ima let you live 
 God says to man ima let you live 
 God says to man ima give you power 
 Not for the intent to misuse your power 
 If you wanna dance you got to play the bands 
 People die by other hands 
 The innocent, the ku klux klan 
 Iraq and Iran and Afghanistan 
 They go to war they don't come back 
 The note comes home killed in attack 
 All the medals from Fort Bragg 
 Collected by a widow along with the flag 
 41 gun salute 4 jets in the air 
 Now that's going out of style the 
 Contribution was fear 
 What you reap is what you sow 
 A man got killed for what he know 
 If you wanna be a -- and get a good wife 
 Stay the fuck offa Skype and don't believe the hype 
 WTF? 
 WTF? 
 WTF?"
174,Public Enemy,hiphop,The Evil Empire Of,"Beware 
 We live in times 
 Under the influence of rhyme 
 To make the masses scared 
 Seems like everything is everywhere 
 Fear the media 
 They make y'all swallow the pill 
 Until we clear the air 
 Beware because adversaries barely care 
 You start off doing it 
 It ends up doing you 
 And using it ends up abusing you 
 And your surrounding crew 
 Charisma of ignorance 
 Makes you hate where you at? 
 Bitter makes you better when you backed by the fact 
 Segregation integration aggregavation 
 Anti immigration from a land in total desperation 
 Y'all ain't gotta buy it or try it 
 I'll say it 
 They wont play it 
 But coming is a new breed of MCs to relay it 
 Easier to be misunderstood 
 Than understand this song

 It's a piece of work

 Been around the world a few times 
 So I seen the hurt 
 Quakes hurricanes and tornados 
 Warning times to man's designs 
 Under that concrete 
 Y'all call the street 
 The heart of land 
 You can hear the beat 
 Pain of all the lies 
 Pain in all them lives 
 Pain of losin homes 
 Pain of the unknown 
 Pain of what you spent 
 Pain of government 
 No matter what you say 
 You don't pay 
 Here they come to take it away 
 Don't give up the fight [2x] 
 Foreign lands and the 7 seas 
 Radiation is the worlds disease 
 Bringing nations down to the knees 
 Mother nature she ain't pleased 
 Trees diseased 
 Deep freeze 
 Doin' us like that govt. cheese 
 Smell that burning in the breeze 
 Summertime 120 degrees 
 Pain of all the lies 
 Pain in all them lives

 Pain of what you spent 
 Pain of government 
 No matter what you say

 Here they come to take it away 
 Don't give up 
 Don't give up the fight [2x] 
 So shut 'em down 
 In appreciation 
 Of the world itself 
 And gods creation 
 What good is the hood if you up to no good 
 Them govt. gangsters would hang you on wood 
 Stop the tape 
 My minds stuck in 68 
 Haight Asbury 
 Now our ass buried in hate 
 I paraphrase 
 Beyond the gaze 
 A haze hovers over a crowd that disobeys 
 Staying rich off them so called better days 
 Do I do a song for the masses 
 Besides what's moving them asses 
 I make stew out of the ashes"

 No answers

 Bomb the earth to pieces 
 They can't calm the world to peace

178,Public Enemy,hiphop,Beyond Trayvon,"(Professor Griff) 
 From the pages of the cress theory, I know you hear me 
 If you out there, listen up, u might feel me 
 Do I, look suspicious on this track, wit the black in it 
 Black hoodie, consciousness and black facts 
 Young kid shot, is the cry we heard 
 Like Emmitt Till, it was tears and our hearts fell 
 No arrest warrant and no weapon found 
 One eye witness, black body down 
 I can hear it now, it's the same ole racist shit 
 Thought he had a gun, is the same ole some bullshit 
 Confessions, of a trigger happy hit man 
 Murderous homicidal nature, there racist plan 
 Burying our black boys, blood thirsty hunger games 
 The face of race is white, they got no shame 
 Stand your ground, legalize lynch law 
 Touch another black kid you have to touch us all 
 (Rahmega) 
 It's time to stand up and just fight for what you believe in 
 I don't call it violence I just call it self defense, call it black intelligence braw to you by the people 
 You just in it to get it, I am in it to make a change, in it to change the game, in it to rearrange, modern day lynching 
 All that leave us is pain, knowledge is power, all I give you is with brains, you see its money power respect, all seems the same. 
 (Khalilwho) 
 Get fear looks 
 But I live round here 
 My house right next to yours 
 But I still get stares 
 In a 
 World of wrongness 
 And fights for the strongest 
 What's the innocent to do 
 When the fight gets brought kid 
 No way your that scared of my hoodie 
 People everywhere getting snared over hoodies 
 Seen a couple pairs get aired by the hoodies 
 But 
 They don't care 
 My skin's bared under hoodies 
 (Jamal Malik aka Young Junior) 
 This world is so chaotic 
 All I witness is violence 
 Watching my brothers die and their sons grow with no guidance 
 Truth's what I'm providing 
 To all those who've been blinded 
 Being sold this equality bullshit I ain't buying 
 I'm so sick and tired of being profiled and instantly 
 Watched close suspiciously because of my ethnicity 
 So stereotypical its despicable 
 And every black male in a hoodie isn't a criminal 
 (Goonie B) 
 This is everyday life where I'm from it goes on but I swear it can not go beyond Trayvon because I'm wearing a hoodie I gotta get shot or stopped by the cops it's not just in Florida its out in farrock people really expect us to act civil right we got a black president and still fighting for civil rights we need to come together and unite because its time to fight the power so put your fists up in the sky 
 (Chuck D) 
 Freed the ass 
 Mind followed 
 With raps that killed tomorrow 
 Can't support it 
 Fought it 
 But somebody bought it 
 Community caught it 
 But the government taught it 
 And all you heard 
 Violence hard drugs sex and murder 
 Songs never hated artists who 
 Keep making em 
 Strong against the wrong 
 What's been created 
 But look 
 Many neighborhoods still devastated 
 I say it 
 Flows overrated 
 Shows underrated 
 I hate it 
 When its degrated and downgraded 
 Spittin' copywritten 
 To music 
 Some of y'all grew up to use it 
 People don't dance to it and just abuse it 
 Y'all say that 
 When I say this 
 Injustice still goes on 
 Beyond Trayvon

 For this word to the young 
 You the future 
 Save our daughters and sons"

 Forgivin' this torture of the system that brought 'cha 
 I'm on a mission and you got that right 
 Addin' fuel to the fire - punch to the fight 
 Many have forgotten what we came here for 
 Never knew or had a clue - so you're on the floor

 Some come near me - some run away 
 Some people take heed to every word I say 
 Some wanna build a posse - some stay away 
 Some people think that we plan to fail 
 Wonder why we go under or we go to jail 
 Some ask us why we act the way we act 
 Without lookin' how long they kept us back

 To see the stupid look stuck on your face 
 Time bomb alarm for the world - just try it

 Respect to you two heroes 
 But trickle down got us less than zero 
 Respect, but last I checked

 Is a million miles to what peoples feelin' 
 No gas

 No stax

 Spend money and time 
 On hair and how we dressing 
 Losin homes, Holmes 
 These stats be on smart phones 
 Don't need new slang to express the pain 
 Of what's really goin' 
 In the real game of life 
 And now what?

 Knowledge of self

 I know a silent nation in dislocation 
 Frustration from legislation 
 Led to demographic in isolation 
 Another participation in decapitation 
 10-4 die river deep mountain high 
 Is a wall stuck between dying and doing time 
 Can't ignore smack dab border war 
 As the beat goes on, words flowed on 
 I caught the law 
 Pyramids machu pichu 
 Things they don't teach you 
 Don't apologize 
 You were here first on this earth 
 Before these millennial cowboys claimed their turf 
 Now who's 1000 miles and ran 
 Deserted in the desert 
 Wild wild west hurt to the dirt 
 Anti immigration 
 Against brown swkin 
 Sounds like brown shirts 
 Silenced by so called legal violence 
 Somebody had permission 
 To put humans in this condition 
 This land is who's land?? 
 They must've forgot 
 Kicking the black in the ass 
 While keeping the brown out 
 This one sided law makes me scream and shout 
 I. c. e. is what I'm talking about 
 (Sgt Hawke) 
 Sgt hawke and I'm found where the cop be 
 I get on illegals like I'm a paparazzi 
 You see the flash but it ain't a camera 
 Gunfire shells hot enough to damage ya 
 No trafficking no drug smuggling 
 I.c.e and we came in thugging 
 Straight off the wire like snoop and chris 
 You get rush like limbargh we get at you quick 
 (Sekreto (translated in English)) 
 What will they do when they find out about this 
 Come for me, for what I represent 
 This is my accent and I'm proud of it. 
 We're bunches and cannot be stopped 
 Absurd laws with racist intentions 
 Benefit only to these classifiers 
 They insist, I insist - so here we go 
 Broken chains, jumping borders 
 Thrive or die, we're no longer satisfied 
 It's time for power to change hands 
 More righteous humans, is more human rights 
 They say, they owners, but we were here first 
 The world is free and without fear we broadcast 
 Multi-color race, is how we're painted 
 I have a dream and that dream has become my desire 
 Power to my peoples, not power to the governments

 Skateboard whores watch 'em close them doors 
 Clap them hands and stomp them feet

 Great driver wack car

 Marxism dual citizens 
 China support 
 Meaning y'all go get a passport 
 Slavery is America's past sport 
 Homeland security 
 Against my homeboys securing me 
 Chained brains diaspora 
 Comin' nafta 
 The same idea of the united states of Africa 
 Bering strait 
 Before Palin and paleface 
 Waiting for the ice to break 
 70% of Americans ain't been no place 
 So the human race gets displaced 
 While the greedy man 
 Sees the land 
 His plan 
 Seize the land 
 To feed his face

 Picked your food 
 Built your house 
 While still on exile 
 Barbed wire and cactus the new middle passage 
 To a person 
 This new whirl odors just rehearsing

 Calisthenics of the tongue exercising the first 
 That's freedom of speech so I speak my right 
 Seems to me there will always be powers to fight 
 So chuck let them know that the bulls break ice 
 With the power of these words that we put within a mic 
 Like those in the past put power to pen 
 It was number 13 made us all equal men 
 Now Arizona back to legislate the hate 
 Guess freedom ain't free on this side of the gate 
 But everything changes if I look a certain way 
 Securing the homeland from how it was made 
 Now the ice that we skate upon is definitely thin 
 But we got to break bad to let the good begin 
 A cold flag pole grabbed a hold of my tongue 
 5-0 froze and we all got dumb

 One man's terrorist, another's freedom fighter 
 Future tech molotov cocktails and a lighter

 You wanna buy a weapon, they won't hesitate a second 
 Whether African, Mexican, Middle East of Haitian 
 They'll slaughter the indigenous and plunder your nation 
 Petition the U.N. to gain legal traction 
 Then call you the enemy to justify the action 
 The brown in this world is to draw ire 
 Of the secret society soul sucking vampire 
 Either I come from a long line of liars 
 Or a degenerate senator's pants are on fire 
 Surround you with walls to protect freedom 
 Overlapping laws to ensure confusion 
 Protect your neck in the 2012 season

 It's my birthday 
 And I'm fitty years... 
 Quiet as kept 
 All them vjs and DJs be old 
 Their jobs sell the young 
 Don't tell 'em what needs to be told 
 When they made pe 
 They broke the mold 
 Didn't quit nothin' 
 Just hit the road 
 I just got back from Soweto 
 You only know half of whatcha say you know 
 I know this records too hot for the radio 
 Did y'all hear what I said if you did 
 Lets go 
 Knock knock 
 We still here still doing our thing 
 Public enemy 
 Doing the right thing 
 We ain't just say any ol' thing 
 Just to get material things 
 I ain't sayin' we ain't bought anything 
 Stuck with the rapping 
 Never tried to sing. 
 Bring the noise raise the roof 
 They afraid of the youth 
 Lookout, duckdown 
 (Can't handle the truth) 
 Now the club ain't no church 
 The church ain't no club 
 Check them DJs mixin up 
 Murder and love 
 Who shoulders the burdn 
 Of all that murderin 
 The people 
 Love spelled backwards is evol 
 Misspelled 
 What the hell 
 The people get pain 
 Dumbed from 
 Another marketing campaign 
 It's my birthday 
 We still killin' the stage 
 I don't give a damn about poppin' Champaign 
 Say what y'all wanna say about 
 Change 
 Revolution I'm a say what I'm saying 
 Rather be stuck up than stuck down 
 Here's the difference 
 I picks up the black and brown 
 Against Mr. man informants and government 
 While real people starve and can't pay their rent 
 They you seriously don't mean what you meant 
 I ain't tricked deceived paid off in agreement 
 Somebody planned it 
 Glad y'all understand it 
 Those that don't 
 Headharded like granite 
 We look out for them too 
 And don't take 'em for granted 
 Like said 
 Somebody planned it. 
 If I see one more person 
 Gonna ask me 
 Again' 
 Y'all still making music 
 Where I begin 
 Now y'all know you don't buy no records no more 
 No tapes, no CDs, no record store 
 Got download zones and ringtones 
 But yo mama and them can't work them cell phones 
 But the revolution goes on and on 
 Still wide awake at 6 in the morning 
 Had to get it out 
 To the break of dawn 
 We still sayin' what we sayin' 
 And not playin'"

 Colors, genders, and ages

 White Supremacy, tendency in currency 
 Estrogen robbin' my oxygen 
 Still dissin' skin (Woop, woop), inform my next of kin

 Government created grown-up 80's crack babies 
 Treat your ass cold till the frostbite bites

 No sympathy from the devil

 Ain't lettin it slide, flippin' love and genocide 
 Ain't forgiven that spit that came with a culture kit 
 Since when did you decide the truth should hide?

 Double nickel, sick this cell 
 Like sickle, I ain't your typical 
 Watch what you heard, ain't revenge of the nerds

 Man don't you worry 'bout (God) No! Get down

 Man don't you worry 'bout (Evil) No! Get down

 There's been nights where them knights cursed us 
 Who fills the jail cells right up and first us 
 I don't believe a damn word I receive 
 Gotta lotta nerve saying, ""If you don't like it just leave""

 Woman or child behind another smile

 In the same old thing

 I boarded a plane headstrong 
 Landed with a smile on my face 
 To give service back to the land that's our home 
 I long for coming back to Africa 
 (Chuck D) 
 So it's cool to be black until it's time to be black 
 Ain't never too late to go back and give back 
 So I let born-afters know I rap for Africa 
 To give to the motherland, to see what's mine again 
 Be of service, land of dark faces 
 Split, colonized in 53 places 
 The greed went on till everything was gone 
 Wiped out by previous wars, I work on 
 Graves of the poor 
 To clean up this mess left by the west 
 My duty to the African, tell my next of kin 
 In a song, but damn, nothing around me 
 And what the hell I step on? 
 (James Bomb) 
 With my head on straight 
 I was gone too damn long 
 Over 450 years, to be exact 
 Not paying attention, I stepped on a mine 
 (Chuck D) 
 On the edge of motherland, around my head 
 Compromised in this Christian missionary position 
 Fear, there must be some way up out of here 
 Whatta bitch, mother eff it in a clean up ditch effort 
 Stepped on some bomb shit that a past war left it 
 Kids dying in them nearby diamond mines 
 Out here working that worldwide grind 
 Hope somebody finds me out left behind 
 Silent ticks killing me softly, Malaria 
 But DeBeers, they the ones got me sick 
 Isolated while I waited with thoughts in my head 
 About my sole intention to save my brothers and sisters 
 (James Bomb) 
 My thoughts is racing as my tears run down my face 
 I came back to help repair what's mine 
 If I move, I'm a goner 
 (Chuck D) 
 My sole intention to save my brothers and sisters 
 How we became boy instead of mister 
 I came too far here to be called some nigga 
 My foot on some bomb, I'ma end up worse than a drifter 
 Myself and what my foot stuck on? 
 360 degrees 
 Mine again, mine again 
 (James Bomb) 
 Was it all worth it? 
 Is Africa really ours? 
 This mine got me thinking 
 All this death and destruction 
 Let's not forget about the corruption 
 To rob the motherland of its resources 
 Is Africa mine? 
 Or the people who sit in the seat of power? 
 Mine again, mine again"

 Yo, what's up?! 
 This is the P.E.S.A. - Public Enemy Service Announcement 
 'Cause I feel this is somethin' that we got to say 
 You see, they're tryin' to make Hardcore Rap disappear 
 Tryin' to make it final for the vinyl 
 Sayin' at this time for the wax to relax 
 Black Radio, yes, I said Black Radio 
 Is puttin' most of us to sleep in the 90s 
 With too many, I said too many, slow jams 
 And I wanna know where's the beats 
 For the mind and for the feet, not the songs that's puttin' me to sleep 
 You see, they're tryin' to make Hardcore Rap disappear 
 By makin' the Rap DJs obsolete, right Kenny Kane? ""YOU KNOW IT G"" 
 My man Kenny Kane from Tampra 
 By makin' the Rap DJs obsolete, while program and music directors gettin' rich 
 With kick backs and phoney seminars 
 Your Record companies out there throw rap on the wall 
 Still know very little about it 
 And figure what sticks it, and what don't, won't be it 
 And the government, awww yes, the government, they want Hardcore to vanish 
 ICE-T's COP KILLER wasn't even a Rap record 
 But you see, ICE-T is a rapper extraordinair 
 And here in America it don't matter 
 Rap is an synonymous with black 
 And even our own don't realize that Rap is even blacker than themselves 
 And to the whites who consider themselves an establishment 
 They feel Rap is the beginnin' of cultural overthrow 
 In their vary own households, between themselves and their kids 
 Oh oh, and the president, the good old president 
 Yo, president, wanna see Hardcore go ghost 
 CUBE is a soldier approved that it raises the roof, with the truth 
 And the NEW WORLD ORDER, wants to see the Hardcore go the way of the Dinosaur 
 A sticker here, a sticker there 
 And now we wear the sticker like a padge, now what? 
 Some wanna see us sing, because when you sing you can't get to the point quick enough 
 In the Hardcore points as sharp and blow the whole joint up 
 Others wanna see the Hardcore dance, and dancin' is enovlved 
 But not when the problem gotta get solved 
 Insurance companies and avenues and buildings and cities 
 They treat us like thieves, but let me tell you; I'm not a thief 
 Just because I spell relief; H-A-R-D Row to the Core will never die 
 If it ain't us, it's somebody else they wanna kill 
 HardCore will never die 
 Hard is not a matter of skills but a battle of wills 
 Remember that! 
 (Chuck D) 
 Skills to kill and fill a hole 
 We roll deep with a frown that's down 
 Low in the meddle of jeep beats 
 So I'm makin' a point, not stickin' butts or blunts 
 But the Terminator X and the rhythm he cuts 
 Figure this bigger brother gonna trigger the track 
 You know, I ain't Country and my name ain't Zack 
 Step back to back, and take a look at the racks 
 My world is a ghetto full of tapes and wax 
 The CDs, they only double the tax 
 And makin' money money, New York city to lax 
 Tell the suckers sucker never ever relax 
 I'm kickin' cold facts so true 
 It feels like I'm livin' in a zoo 
 (Flavor Flav) 
 Now, who wanna tell the psycho? 
 But I'm all right though 
 I wanna fight crazy and dirty 
 These niggas wanna tell the psycho 
 But I'm all right though 
 I wanna fight crazy and dirty

 Sayin' I'm down like psycho, where's my rifle? 
 Right though, I ain't Michael 
 Yo, I ain't sittin' on the dock of the bay 
 Wastin' time in a crime with a nine 
 Rather find another brutal rhyme 
 It's us verses, I put it all in verses 
 If the sound reverses, I pump it up with curses 
 Fuck sittin' in the back of the bus 
 But don't front what we lack 
 We got it loaded in a back pack 
 See, they can do it to a man 
 But with men suckers Semi' 
 Think that shit before they come again 
 No science to the wild senile 
 Slackin' 'cause he's packin' like a runaway child 
 Yeah, would I ever try to sever? 
 Hell no, never would work if the rhyme wasn't clever 
 Wild, in an Isle stackin' high from the floor tile 
 Back in the rack, where the rap never seen yet 
 Gettin' to the corner wanna scream what I gonna wanna do 
 Feels like I'm livin' in a zoo 
 (Flavor Flav) 
 Who wanna tell the psycho? 
 But I'm all right though 
 I wanna fight crazy and dirty 
 These niggas wanna tell the psycho 
 But I'm all right though 
 I wanna fight crazy and dirty 
 Feels like I'm livin' in a zoo --) Chuck D 
 (Chuck D) 
 I don't know where I'm at 
 Here's a track, I try to duck duck (*3 Gun Shots*) 
 Those 3 bullets in the back Top 40 
 Ignore me 
 So, I hit them in the hood 
 Until it feel good, ugh 
 (Flavor Flav) 
 Niggas wanna tell the psycho 
 But I'm all right though 
 I wanna fight crazy and dirty 
 These niggas wanna tell the psycho 
 But I'm all right though 
 I wanna fight crazy and dirty 
 (Chuck D) 
 It's not a matter of skills but a battle of wills 
 Pow the stick up go the quicker the picker up 
 Trigger eenie meanie with the gat that so fat 
 Brrap bop bop, Cop Killer in a 16 wheeler 
 They call me over the phone, che-che-checkin' me out 
 Takin' my time to find a brother droppin' the dimes 
 And lookin' over the zone of the murder that Hardcore 
 Livin' like Cube said: Once again it's on 
 And while we tell it like CNN 
 My friends to end, close by spine, the rhythm tell the bombs 
 The bigger the Bam bam, damn the whole squad is mine 
 But the Hardcore fans who am I give them slammin' 
 In the paint, and I ain't givin' up no props to the game 
 And it stops in the name of the Hip-Hop Reign 
 And the pain got me goin' 
 Goddamn, won't they even pull a bullet on a pop jam 
 (Flavor Flav) 
 Niggas wanna tell the psycho 
 But I'm all right though, come on! 
 I wanna fight crazy and dirty 
 These niggas wanna tell the psycho 
 But I'm all right though 
 I wanna fight crazy and dirty 
 Feels like I'm livin' in a zoo --) Chuck D 
 (Chuck D) 
 This time, the hard rhymer, won't get no bullet 
 Even if the fan him pull willin' 
 Be on '95 chillin', be up on fly superstar true fullin' 
 Livin' in my shack with a how to get a hard time livin' 
 With the level, I'm survivin' on the rhyme and skills 
 With the wheel of the killer gets banned and geared 
 From the shelfs of the All American Store 
 Ms. Gore got sticker 
 The only way you hear it if we wanna hit the kicker 
 If it's not dum didditty dum, didditty didditty dum 
 You wouldn't know she's in the house when the president come 
 What I gotta do if the Rap and the love turnin' so crap? (*Gun Shot*) 
 Makes feel like I'm livin' in a zoo 
 (Flavor Flav) 
 Now who wanna tell the psycho? 
 But I'm all right though 
 I wanna fight crazy and dirty 
 These niggas wanna tell the psycho 
 But I'm all right though 
 I wanna fight crazy and dirty
