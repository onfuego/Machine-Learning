 About this girl 
 (Justin) 
 Come in right here? 
 (Pharrell) 
 Yeah, come on 
 On that sunny day 
 Didn't know I'd meet 
 Such a beautiful girl 
 Walking down the street 
 Seen those bright brown eyes 
 With tears coming down 
 She deserves a crown 
 But where is it now 
 Mama listen 
 Se単orita, I feel for you 
 You deal with things, that you don't have to 
 He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm 
 But you could feel this real love 
 If you just lay in my... 
 Running fast in my mind 
 Girl won't you slow it down 
 If we carry on this way 
 This thing might leave the ground 
 How would you like to fly? 
 That's how my queen should RIDE! 
 But you still deserve a crown 
 Well hasn't it been found? 
 Mamma listen 
 Se単orita, I feel for you 
 (Feel for you) 
 You deal with things, that you don't have to 
 (No, no)

 Ah, ah, arms... 
 (Won't you lay in my) 
 Ah, ah, arms... 
 (Mama lay in my) 
 Ah, ah, arms... 
 (Baby won't you lay in my) 
 Ah, ah, arms... 
 When I look into your eyes 
 I see something that money can't buy 
 And I know if you give us a try 
 I'll work hard for you girl 
 And no longer will you ever have to cry 
 Se単orita, I feel for you 
 You deal with things, that you don't have to

1,Justin Timberlake,pop,Like I Love You,"Just somethin' about you 
 The way I'm lookin' at you, whatever 
 Keep lookin' at me 
 Gettin' scared now, right 
 Don't fear me baby, it's just Justin 
 It feel good right, listen 
 I kinda noticed something one night, 
 In the club a frump face, 
 It's kinda weird to me, since you're so fine 
 If it's up to me your face'll change 
 If you smile then that should set the tone 
 Just be limber 
 And if you let go the music should move your bones 
 Just remember 
 Sing this song with me 
 Ain't nobody love ya like I love ya 
 You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (hey) 
 Late at night I talk to you 
 You will know the difference when I touch ya 
 Some people are so phony 
 Nosy 'cause they're lonely 
 Aren't you sick of the same thing? 
 They say so and so is datin' 
 Love you or they're hatin' 
 When it doesn't matter anyway 
 'Cause we're here tonight 
 If you smile then that should set the tone 
 Just be limber baby 
 And if you let go the music should move your bones 
 Baby, just remember 
 Sing this song with me 
 Ain't nobody love ya like I love ya 
 You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (hey) 
 Late at night I talk to you 
 You will know the difference when I touch ya 
 Yeah 
 You know I could make you happy 
 I could change your life 
 If you give me that chance to be your man 
 I won't let you down baby 
 If you give me that chance to be your man 
 Here baby, hold my jacket 
 And then... 
 Maybe we'll fly the night away 
 (I just want to love you baby, yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 Girl 
 Maybe we'll fly the night away 
 (I just wanna love ya baby) 
 Girl... 
 (Pusha T) 
 Ma' whatcha wanna do? 
 I'm in front of you 
 Grab a friend, see I can have fun with two 
 Or me and you put on a stage show 
 And the mall kids, that's how to change low 
 Point to her they say 'Wow, it's the same glow' 
 Point to me I say 'Yeah, it's the same dough' 
 We the same type, you my air of life 
 You have me sleepin' in the same bed er'night 
 (Malice) 
 Do a robbery, you deservin' the best 
 Take a few shots 
 Let it burn in your chest 
 We could ride down 
 Pumpin' N.E.R.D in the deck 
 Funny how a few words turn into sex 
 (I just love your... brain...) 
 Play number three, Joint called 'Brain' 
 Ma, take a hint 
 Make a swerve in the lane 
 The name Malicious 
 And I burn every track 
 Clipse and J. Timberlake 
 Now how heavy is that? 
 Maybe we'll fly the night away 
 (I just wanna love ya baby, yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 Girl... 
 Maybe we'll fly the night away 
 (I just wanna love ya baby, girl...) 
 Ain't nobody love you like I love ya 
 (Can't love ya like I do) 
 You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya 
 (Makes me trust ya like I do, hey) 
 Late at night I talk to you (hey) 
 You will know the difference when I... 
 (Break it down) 
 You know 
 I used to dream about this when I was a little boy 
 I never thought it would end up this way 
 Drums... (hey) 
 It's kinda special right, yeah 
 You know, if you think about it 
 Sometimes people are just destined 
 Destined to do what they do 
 And that's what it is 
 Now everybody dance"

3,Justin Timberlake,pop,Take It From Here,"Sometimes, sometimes the world gets hard 
 Oh na na na 
 I'm gonna take it from here girl 
 Don't you worry 
 I wanna be your lake, or your bay 
 And any problems that you have 
 I wanna wash 'em away 
 I wanna be your sky 
 So blue and high 
 And every time you think of me 
 I wanna blow your mind 
 I wanna be your air 
 So sweet and fair 
 So when you feel that you can't breathe 
 Ma, I'll be there 
 I wanna be your answer, all the time 
 When you see how I put your life before mine 
 With no question 
 When all the love feels gone 
 And you can't carry on 
 Don't worry, girl 
 I'ma take it from here 
 Just as sure as the sun will shine 
 Every morning, every time 
 Don't worry, girl 
 I'ma take it from here 
 I wanna hold your hands 
 Reveal all your plans 
 I wanna make sure every one of your dreams is there 
 I would be your broadway show on review (why) 
 So I can act out how God was when he made you 
 I wanna be your lighthouse when you get lost 
 I'll light a bright and shiny path to help you across (light the way for you 
 Baby) 
 I wanna be your mother... wait 
 See what I see 
 And when you see that can't nobody hold you like me 
 'Cause I love you 
 When all the love feels gone 
 And you can't carry on 
 Don't worry, girl 
 I'ma take it from here 
 Just as sure as the sun will shine 
 Every morning, every time 
 Don't worry, girl (no no) 
 I'ma take it from here 
 And when there's no one there to hold 
 And you realize the world is cold 
 Don't worry, girl 
 I'ma take it from here 
 (That's what I'm gonna do) 
 That's what I'm gonna do 
 Just as sure as the sun will shine 
 Every morning, every time 
 (Don't you worry, baby) 
 Don't worry, girl 
 I'ma take it from here 
 Give me one reason why we should not be leaving 
 This world is so deceiving, the time is now 
 Let's fly away speeding 
 Through the Garden of Eden 
 Where all the sweet breathing of love surrounds 
 When all the love feels gone 
 And you can't carry on 
 Don't worry, girl 
 I'ma take it from here 
 Just as sure as the sun will shine 
 Every morning, every time 
 Don't worry, girl 
 I'ma take it from here 
 Give me one reason 
 Why we should not be leaving 
 This world is so deceiving 
 The time is now 
 Lets fly away speeding 
 (We'll fly away) 
 Through the Garden of Eden 
 Where all the sweet breathing of love surrounds 
 When all the love feels gone 
 And you can't carry on 
 Don't worry, girl 
 I'ma take it from here 
 Just as sure as the sun will shine 
 Every morning, every time 
 Don't worry, girl 
 I'ma take it from here 
 (Got something to tell you baby) 
 Love ain't always the way they write in books 
 (No, no) 
 See there's the good guys 
 And also heartbreak crooks 
 Your hearts the real one 
 Just take a look inside 
 'Cause it's a colorful illustrated guide 
 So there you go 
 Don't worry 
 To help you weather the storm 
 I'll be there mami 
 No matter what time 
 No matter what place 
 You can always count on me 
 I'll take it from here"

6,Justin Timberlake,pop,Nothin' Else,"I was just walking that day aimlessly 
 You picked the perfect day to bump into me (perfect day) 
 Probably should have watched the stars in the sky the night before 
 But for some reason 
 We still met at your store 
 You baby 
 And your eyes have a story 
 That they wish to tell 
 And I have my whole life and I listen well 
 Hey 
 Look I'll be your confidante 
 Tell me anything 
 But please start it off with how you tuck your wings 
 There's nothing else that I have seen 
 There's no getting around it or in between 
 You're out of this world 
 Except you're not green (look) 
 You don't know what you mean to me 
 To me 
 All my friends meet you and say you're the one 
 (You're the one you're the one) 
 And all my meaningless friendships should be done 
 I should just leave them alone 
 Baby hey hey 
 You had a friend but he did you wrong 
 But I'm a God sent sign that reads 
 Please move on with me 
 You taught me to use my heart and forget my eyes 
 (Use my heart forget my eyes) 
 And that's the way to his kingdom to eternal life 
 Since you're an angel baby your job's never done 
 Too bad the world won't see you when they dial 911

 There's nothing else in this world 
 Like you 
 Yeah 
 So why is it so complicated 
 What are you afraid of 
 I've been asking everybody what they think 
 But I don't know why because they don't know you 
 I'm even askin other guys what would they say 
 I don't know why 'cause they don't know what I do 
 Girls say an ultimatums the thing 
 But you'd probably take that and just run 
 Now I gotta decide if I'ma help raise your mind 
 Seems like the ultimatums on me, that's no fun 
 I was just walking that day aimlessly

 Beautiful lights, the star-filled nights 
 They don't mean a thing 
 'Cause you are my star 
 So it don't seem right 
 Without you here with me 
 Now I can try to act real strong 
 But you and I both know 
 It's hard for me to say you were my soul 
 Now I could say that I don't love you no more 
 And I could say that I've closed the door... for our love 
 And I could tell you I feel it's time for us 
 To go our separate ways 
 But baby I just wouldn't be the same 
 'Cause girl you're love is still on my brain 
 Now when you're in love it takes time to heal 
 When someone has broken your heart it changes how you feel 
 Girl I... thought that you'd never do me that way 
 But even after all I still think of you that way, yeah 
 No, no... 
 Now I could say that I don't love you no more 
 (I could say this... I could say that) 
 And I could say that I've closed the door... for our love 
 (For our love) 
 And I could tell you I feel it's time for us 
 To go our separate ways 
 But baby I just wouldn't be the same 
 'Cause girl you're love is still on my brain (brain yeah) 
 Now love is a game 
 That we both like to play 
 Will I win or lose if I go or if I stay, yeah 
 Even though I try to hide 
 My broken heart inside 
 Girl you know me inside out 
 And I can't get you off my mind 
 Now I could say that I don't love you no more 
 (I could say that I... yeah, yeah) 
 And I could say that I've closed the door... for our love 
 (Closed the door) 
 And I could tell you I feel it's time for us 
 (I could tell you I feel it's time for us) 
 To go our separate ways (Oh no, no) 
 But baby I just wouldn't be the same (Wouldn't be the same) 
 'Cause girl you're love is still on my brain 
 (Still on my brain, yeah) 
 La-la-la-la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la

 You don't have to pack everything

 And forget everything baby 
 Got laid off at your job today 
 You've been working at this place for years 
 And though you were underpaid 
 Mommy that place isn't worth your tears

 We can spend the night, till the morning light

 Girl you're the best 
 You could be 
 An angel among society 
 But you get crushed 
 From what you see 
 You try to hard to help and that's enough for me 
 (Woo..) 
 Try to change what you can 
 And accept all the things that you cannot 
 (Don't stress yourself baby) 
 I know you wanna fly away from the world

 That once you feel like a winner 
 No more crying 
 And baby I know just what you need 
 (I know) 
 To let your hair down so that you feel free, yea 
 (Hair, yea yea yea) 
 It hurts me to watch you sing the blues 
 (It hurts me baby) 
 Girl you're so confused 
 (Let's get away) 
 And I know what to do 
 Let's take a ride, on the country side 
 Let's just get away

12,Justin Timberlake,pop,Never Again,"Would have given up my life for you 
 Guess it's true what they say about love 
 It's blind 
 Girl, you lied straight to my face 
 Looking in my eyes 
 And I believed you 'cause I loved you more than life 
 And all you had to do 
 Was apologize 
 You didn't say you're sorry 
 I don't understand 
 You don't care that you hurt me 
 And now I'm half the man 
 That I used to be when it was you and me 
 You didn't love me enough 
 My heart may never mend 
 And you'll never get to love me, again 
 No, no, no, no, no, no 
 Sadness has me at the end of the line 
 Helpless watched you break this heart of mine 
 And loneliness only wants you back here with me 
 Common sense knows that you're not good enough for me 
 And all you had to do 
 Was apologize, and mean it 
 But you didn't say you're sorry 
 I don't understand 
 You don't care that you hurt me 
 And now I'm half the man 
 That I used to be when it was you and me 
 You didn't love me enough 
 My heart may never mend 
 And you'll never get to love me 
 Wish like hell I could go back in time 
 Maybe then I could see how 
 Forgiveness says that I should give you one more try 
 But it's too late, it's over now 
 You didn't say you're sorry 
 I don't understand 
 You don't care that you hurt me 
 And now I'm half the man 
 That I used to be when it was you and me 
 You didn't love me enough 
 My heart may never mend 
 And you'll never get to love me 
 Again, yeah 
 Again, yeah, yeah 
 Again, again, again, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Never get to love me"
13,Justin Timberlake,pop,Am I Worthy Of,"Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Oh 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Girl I find you so amazing 
 With everyday I learn more about you 
 The way you work day out and day in 
 And still find time for us too 
 I love the fact that you're there for me when I feel down 
 No matter what I'm going through 
 Lately I've been questioning myself 
 Am I good enough for you 
 Am I worthy of 
 Am I man enough 
 Am I strong enough 
 To maintain this love 
 You got me questioning 
 Got me wondering 
 Could I be that man 
 That can keep you happy 
 I know that there'll be times when I'll be miles away 
 And you'll be all alone 
 I constantly fight my insecurities 
 When I can't reach you by phone 
 And oh lord knows that I'm only human 
 So please forgive me if I ask so many silly questions 
 I know that you truly love me, 
 But, fear has me second guessing 
 Am I worthy of 
 Am I man enough 
 Am I strong enough 
 To maintain this love 
 You got me questioning 
 Got me wondering 
 Could I be that man 
 That can keep you happy 
 Girl, excuse my ways (excuse my ways) 
 I'm not trying to push your love away (ooh... love... love away) 
 It's just that sometimes 
 My imagination gets the best of me, yeah 
 I still love you baby 
 Everyday 
 Am I worthy of 
 Am I man enough 
 Am I strong enough 
 To maintain this love (to maintain this love) 
 You got me questioning 
 Got me wondering (you got me thinkin' bout myself) 
 Could I be that man (Am I good enough for you) 
 That can keep you happy (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...) 
 Am I worthy of 
 Am I man enough 
 Am I strong enough 
 To maintain this love

 Do... Ooh... 
 You're still captivating even though it's been so long

 'Cause now you march to the beat of a different song 
 Try to understand that we needed space 
 But everywhere I turn I see your face 
 I've been waiting for you to come home 
 'Cause I don't want to be alone 
 I still love you 
 Why did you take away your love 
 When did you think to just give up 
 How am I supposed to carry on now 
 Without you 
 You are my light 
 I have changed girl since I last saw you 
 When you left, you don't know what you put me through 
 But my heart's still racing just being next to you 
 I can't escape the magic in your eyes 
 Is there a way to make you realize 
 There's no one more special to my heart 
 But you want us to be apart 
 I still love you 
 Why did you take away your love, baby 
 When did you think to just give up, yeah 
 How am I supposed to carry on now 
 Without you 
 You were my world 
 You meant everything to me 
 You're the air I breathe 
 The song I sing 
 You were my queen, I was your king 
 But if we can try to work it 
 We'll show the world what love is about 
 Baby come home 'cause I can't take no more 
 Of this loneliness 
 And emptiness 
 Why did you take away your love 
 (Take away your love) 
 When did you think to just give up 
 (Oh...) 
 How am I supposed to carry on now 
 Without you 
 Why did you take away your love 
 When did you think to just give up 
 How am I supposed to carry on

 If I wrote you a symphony 
 Just to say how much you mean to me, what would you do? 
 If I told you you were beautiful 
 Would you date me on the regular, tell me, would you? 
 Well, baby I've been around the world 
 But I ain't seen myself another girl like you 
 This ring here represents my heart 
 But there's just one thing I need from you, say ""I do"" 
 Yeah, because 
 I can see us holdin' hands 
 Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand

 I don't know why she hesitates for a man 
 Shorty, cool as a fan on the new once again 
 But he still has fan from Peru to Japan 
 Listen baby, I don't wanna ruin with your plan 
 But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can 
 'Cause the girl's real wild, throw their hands up high 
 When they wanna come kick it with a standup guy 
 You don't really wanna let the chance go by 
 'Cause you ain't been seen wit' a man so fly 
 Baby, friend so fly I can go fly 
 Private, 'cause I handle mine 
 T.I. they call me candle guy 
 Simply 'cause I am on fire 
 I hate to have to cancel my vacation so you can't deny 
 I'm patient, but I ain't gonna try 
 You don't come, I ain't gonna die 
 Hold up, what you mean, you can't go why? 
 Me and you boyfriend we ain't no tie 
 You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high 
 Well baby, it's obvious that I ain't your guy 
 I ain't gon' lie, I feel your space 
 But forget your face, I swear I will 
 Same bark, same bullet, anywhere I chill 
 Just bring wit me any pair, I will 
 I can see us holding hands 
 Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand 
 I can see us on the countryside 
 Sitting on the grass, laying side by side

 She's freaky and I like it 
 Listen 
 She grabs the yellow bottle 
 She likes the way it hits her lips 
 She gets to the bottom 
 It sends her on a trip so right 
 She might be goin' home with me tonight 
 She looks like a model 
 Except she got a little more ass 
 Don't even bother 
 Unless you've got that thing she likes 
 I hope she's goin' home with me tonight 
 Those flashing lights come from everywhere 
 The way they hit 'em I have to stop and stare 
 She's got me love stoned and I swear she's bad 
 And she knows 
 I think that she knows 
 She's freaky and she knows it 
 She's freaky, but I like it 
 She shuts the room down 
 The way she walks and causes a fuss 
 The baddest in town 
 She's flawless like some uncut ice 
 I hope she's goin' home with me tonight 
 And all she wants is to dance 
 That's why you'll find her on the floor 
 But you don't have a chance 
 Unless you move the way that she likes 
 That's why she's goin' home with me tonight 
 Those flashing lights come from everywhere 
 The way they hit 'em I have to stop and stare 
 She's got me love stoned and I swear she's bad 
 And she knows 
 I think that she knows 
 Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare 
 The way they hit 'em I have to stop and stare 
 She's got me love stoned from everywhere 
 She's that and she knows 
 I think that she knows 
 Now dance 
 Little girl 
 You're freaky, but I like it 
 Hot damn! 
 Let me put my funk on this one time 
 Those flashing lights come from everywhere 
 The way they hit 'em I have to stop and stare 
 She's got me love stoned and I swear she's bad 
 And she knows 
 I think that she knows 
 Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare 
 The way they hit 'em I have to stop and stare 
 She's got me love stoned from everywhere 
 She's that and she knows 
 I think that she knows 
 Those flashing lights come from everywhere 
 The way they hit 'em I have to stop and stare 
 She's got me love stoned 
 Man I swear she's that and she knows 
 I think that she knows 
 Those flashing lights come from everywhere 
 The way they hit 'em I just stop and stare 
 She's got me love stoned 
 I think I'm love stoned 
 She's got me love stoned 
 I think that she knows, think that she knows, oh, oh (repeat 2 more times) 
 Those flashing lights come from everywhere 
 The way they hit 'em I just stop and stare 
 I'm love stoned from everywhere and she knows 
 I think that she knows 
 Think that she knows, oh, oh 
 And now I walk around without a care 
 She's got me hooked

 Is he everything you wanted in a man? 
 You know I gave you the world 
 You had me in the palm of your hand

 I just can't seem to understand 
 Thought it was me and you, baby 
 Me and you until the end 
 But I guess I was wrong 
 Don't want to think about it 
 Don't want to talk about it 
 I'm just so sick about it 
 Can't believe it's ending this way 
 Just so confused about it 
 Feeling the blues about it 
 I just can't do without you 
 Tell me is this fair? 
 Is this the way it's really going down? 
 Is this how we say goodbye? 
 Should've known better when you came around 
 That you were gonna make me cry 
 It's breaking my heart to watch you run around 
 'Cause I know that you're living a lie 
 But that's okay baby 'cause in time you will find

 You said that you were moving on now (on now) 
 And maybe I should do the same (maybe I should do the same) 
 Funny thing about that is 
 I was ready to give you my name 
 Thought it was me and you, baby 
 And now, it's all just a shame 
 And I guess I was wrong 
 Don't want to think about it, no 
 Don't want to talk about it, hmm 
 I'm just so sick about it 
 Can't believe it's ending this way 
 Just so confused about it, uh 
 Feeling the blues about it, yeah 
 I just can't do without you 
 Can you tell me is this fair? 
 Is this the way it's really going down? 
 Is this how we say goodbye? 
 Shoulda known better when you came around

 Yo, yo 
 Let me paint this picture for you baby 
 You spend your nights alone 
 And he never comes home 
 And every time you call him 
 All you get's a busy tone 
 I heard you find out 
 That he's doing to you 
 What you did to me 
 Ain't that the way it goes 
 When you cheated, girl 
 My heart bleeded, girl 
 So it goes without saying 
 That you left me feeling hurt 
 Just a classic case 
 A scenario 
 Tale as old as time 
 Girl you got what you deserved 
 And now you want somebody 
 To cure the lonely nights 
 You wish you had somebody 
 That could come and make it right 
 But girl I ain't somebody 
 I'm out of sympathy 
 You'll see 
 (What goes around comes back around) 
 I thought I told ya, hey 
 (What goes around comes back around) 
 I thought I told ya, hey 
 (What goes around comes back around) 
 I thought I told ya, hey

 I like the way you talk your game we might be one and the same 
 Now I know you got a buzz out of that alcohol 
 I got a house that can entertain all of y'all 
 Maybe later on I'll give you a phone call 
 I'm 'bout to slide out, but I'll get back at you, oh 
 And when I call don't give me the run-around 
 I ain't gonna have you tryin' to play me like a silly clown

 Harder to kick than cigarettes and green thangs 
 Harder to escape than jail cells and bills 
 You had me lost since the feeling girl and pigtales

 Got me cryin' rivers like Timbaland and Timberlake, yeah 
 They call me Juicy J straight up out the Three 6 Mafia 
 Ghetto fab playa on these streets I'm tryin' a holla at ya 
 Playing games girl you got my head spinnin' 'round 
 I ain't gonna chirp your T-Mobile phone and chase you all over town 
 I just want to pick you up and take you to resting nest 
 (Smacking sound) Is it good? (smacking sound) Is it good?

25,Justin Timberlake,pop,Losing My Way,"Yeah um, excuse me 
 Hi, my name is Bob and I work at my job 
 I make forty-something dollars a day 
 I used to be the man in my hometown 
 Until I started to lose my way 
 It all goes back to when I dropped out of school 
 Having fun, I was living the life 
 But now I got a problem with that little white rock 
 See I can't put down the pipe 
 And it is breaking me down 
 Watching the world spin round 
 While my dreams fall down 
 Is anybody out there? 
 It is breaking me down 
 No more friends around 
 And my dreams fall down 
 Is anybody out there? 
 Can anybody out there hear me? 
 'Cause I can't seem to hear myself 
 Can anybody out there see me? 
 'Cause I can't seem to see myself 
 There's gotta be a heaven somewhere 
 Can you save me from this hell? 
 Can anybody out there feel me? 
 'Cause I can't seem to feel myself 
 Losing my way, oh, keep losing my way, oh 
 Keep losing my way, can you help me find my way? 
 Losing my way, oh, keep losing my way, oh 
 Keep losing my way, can you help me find my way? 
 Now you gotta understand I was a family man 
 I would have done anything for my own 
 But I couldn't get a grip on my new found itch 
 So I ended up all alone 
 I remember where I was when I got my first buzz 
 See I thought I was living the life 
 And the craziest thing is I probably never know 
 The color of my daughter's eyes 
 And it is breaking me down 
 Watching the world spin round 
 While my dreams fall down 
 Is anybody out there? 
 It is breaking me down 
 No more friends around 
 And my dreams fall down 
 Is anybody out there? 
 Can anybody out there hear me? 
 'Cause I can't seem to hear myself 
 Can anybody out there see me? 
 'Cause I can't seem to see myself 
 There's gotta be a heaven somewhere (There's gotta be a heaven somewhere) 
 Can you save me from this hell? (Can you save me?) 
 Can anybody out there feel me? 
 'Cause I can't seem to feel myself 
 Losing my way (yeah), keep losing my way (losing my way) 
 Keep losing my way (keep losing my way), can you help me find my way? (Oh yeah, yeah) 
 Losing my way (losing my way), keep losing my way (keep losing my way) 
 Keep losing my way, so can you help me find my way? 
 Oh, my God, please forgive me (Father, hear my prayer) 
 'Cause I know I've done some wrong in this life (in this life) 
 If I could do it all again (do it all again), have just one more chance 
 To take all those wrongs and make them right, oh 
 Can anybody out there hear me? (Oh) 
 'Cause I can't seem to hear myself (Hey) 
 Can anybody out there see me? (Anybody out there see me?) 
 'Cause I can't seem to see myself 
 There's gotta be a heaven somewhere (There's gotta be a heaven somewhere) 
 Can you save me from this hell? (Hey) 
 Can anybody out there feel me? (Feel me) 
 'Cause I can't seem to feel myself (Feel me, hey)

 Can anybody out there see me? 
 'Cause I can't seem to see myself (I can't seem to see myself) 
 There's gotta be a heaven somewhere (There's gotta be a heaven somewhere) 
 Can you save me from this hell? (Can you save me from this hell?) 
 Can anybody out there feel me? 
 'Cause I can't seem to feel myself 
 Losing my way, keep losing my way (keep losing my way) 
 Keep losing my way (keep losing my way), can you help me find my way? (No, no, hear my cry)

 'Cause I'll give you my heart if you would let me start all over again

 But I threw it away 
 So now I stand here today asking forgiveness 
 And if you could just please give me another chance to write you another song and take back those things I've done 
 'Cause I'll give you my heart if you would let me start all over again

 Don't you leave me standing here once again

 You and me that's the recipe for a good time 
 And it ain't really nothing but clothes in the way 
 Tell me you wanna get close somewhere far away, far away 
 Don't worry about your loving it won't go to waste, go to waste 
 Don't ever change your flavor 'cause I love the taste, love the taste 
 And if you ask me where I wanna go, I say all the way 
 'Cause she's just like nothing 
 That I ever seen before, 
 And baby please don't change nothing 
 Because your flavor's so original 
 And it all started when she said 
 Hey hey hey, smacking that strawberry bubblegum 
 You really got me when you said 
 Hey hey hey, popping that strawberry bubblegum 
 My little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum 
 My little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum 
 She's my little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum 
 My little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum, 
 Hey, hey, hey, my little, hey, hey, hey 
 Come in, sit down, let me elevate your appetite. 
 Any flavor you want. Now my selection is the tasty kind 
 But you, you're delicious on your own. 
 After I break you down my fingers, it's so sweet 
 That's what you told me when I touched on your lips. 
 Towel under the door, girl, before they pick up your scent ah 
 If you'll be my strawberry bubblegum, 
 Then I'll be your blueberry lollipop 
 If you'll be my strawberry bubblegum, 
 Then I'll be your blueberry lollipop 
 Then I'll love you till I make it pop. 
 If you'll be my strawberry bubblegum, 
 Then I'll be your blueberry lollipop 
 (Little girl would you be my) 
 If you'll be my strawberry bubblegum, 
 Then I'll be your blueberry lollipop 
 And then I'll love you till I make it pop 
 Hey, hey, hey.

 And all these stars been dancing on my head 
 Too long, too long, too long! 
 I wrote a song for you, I wanna sing to you 
 Every time I'm close to you 
 Words wanna come out, but I forget

 Everything extra in the background, just fades into the set 
 As we ride off in the sun 
 Didn't I seem like I'm catching something?

 And with the top down, we'll cruise around 
 Land and make love on the moon 
 Would you like that? 
 Hop into my spaceship coupe 
 There's only room for two (Me and you) 
 And with the top of you wrapped up 
 In my space lover cocoon. 
 And I love it when I hear you say 
 Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

 And show you the backseat view, view, if it's cool, cool

 They shine, they shine 
 Just for you

 I saved a seat for you 
 Right here next to me 
 I'm going to take you to the moon 
 And I'm going to make you say

39,Justin Timberlake,pop,Mirrors,"Aren't you somethin' to admire 
 Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror 
 And I can't help but notice 
 You reflect in this heart of mine 
 If you ever feel alone and 
 The glare makes me hard to find 
 Just know that I'm always 
 Parallel on the other side 
 Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul 
 I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go 
 Just put your hand on the glass 
 I'm here tryin' to pull you through 
 You just gotta be strong 
 Cause I don't wanna lose you now 
 I'm lookin' right at the other half of me 
 The vacancy that sat in my heart 
 Is a space that now you hold 
 Show me how to fight for now 
 And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy 
 Comin' back here to you once I figured it out 
 You were right here all along 
 It's like you're my mirror 
 My mirror staring back at me 
 I couldn't get any bigger 
 With anyone else beside me 
 And now it's clear as this promise 
 That we're making 
 Two reflections into one 
 Cause it's like you're my mirror 
 My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me 
 Aren't you somethin', an original 
 Cause it doesn't seem really as sample 
 And I can't help but stare, cause 
 I see truth somewhere in your eyes 
 I can't ever change without you 
 You reflect me, I love that about you 
 And if I could, I 
 Would look at us all the time 
 Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul 
 I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go

 Tomorrow's a mystery 
 I can see you lookin' back at me 
 Keep your eyes on me

 I'm lookin' right at the other half of me

 You are, you are the love of my life 
 Baby, you're the inspiration of this precious song 
 And I just wanna see your face light up since you put me on 
 So now I say goodbye to the old me, it's already gone 
 And I can't wait wait wait wait wait to get you home 
 Just to let you know, you are 
 Girl you're my reflection, all I see is you 
 My reflection, in everything I do 
 You're my reflection and all I see is you 
 My reflection, in everything I do 
 You are, you are the love of my life"
40,Justin Timberlake,pop,Blue Ocean Floor,"Frequency so low held on a string 
 A string that only plays solos 
 Rain made of echoes 
 Tidal wave rushing on and on 
 Under the water you scream so loud 
 But the silence surrounds you 
 But I hear it loud when you fall in the deep and I'll always find you 
 If my red eyes don't see you anymore 
 And I can't hear you through the white noise 
 Just send your heart beat, I'll go 
 To the blue ocean floor 
 Where they'll find us no more 
 On the Blue Ocean Floor 
 On the Blue Ocean Floor 
 On the Blue Ocean Floor 
 On the Blue Ocean Floor 
 On the Blue Ocean Floor 
 Shell made out of gold 
 Found on a beach picked up in your hand held so close 
 Rain washed out its glow, heart beat steady leads me down below 
 And under the water you scream so loud 
 But the silence surrounds you 
 But I hear it loud when you fall in the deep and I'll always find you 
 If my red eyes don't see you anymore 
 And I can't hear you through the white noise 
 Just send your heart beat, I'll go to the blue ocean floor 
 Where they'll find us no more 
 On the Blue Ocean Floor 
 On the Blue Ocean Floor 
 On the Blue Ocean Floor 
 On the Blue Ocean Floor 
 On the Blue Ocean Floor 
 20,000 leagues away catch up to you on the same day 
 Travel at the speed of light thinking the same thought at the same time 
 Heartbeat's at a steady pace, I'll let the rhythm show me the way 
 No one can find us here, fade out and disappear 
 If my red eyes don't see you anymore 
 And I can't hear you through the white noise 
 Just send your heart beat, I'll go to the blue ocean floor 
 Where they'll find us no more 
 On the Blue Ocean Floor

44,Justin Timberlake,pop,True Blood,"Give it to me, there goes the boogie, there goes the howl 
 Give it to me, there goes the boogie, there goes the howl 
 Give it to me, there goes the boogie, there goes the howl 
 Give it to me, there goes the boogie, there goes the howl 
 Red red red red red red red red 
 Red was the color of her eyes 
 When she put me in a meditation state 
 Her skin was white so white 
 Looked like it had no expiration date 
 Black is the color of the night 
 When it's time for feeding and her body wakes 
 There's just something 'bout the demon that she brings out of me 
 When we raise hell I can't stay away 
 Give it to me now 
 So evil in the dress 
 It circulates you start to feel it 
 Devil in the flesh 
 Once she starts to invoke the spirits 
 Got you on the floor 
 She comes alive when you're the killing 
 Hungry for some more 
 Hey, I think she's got that true blood 
 Every time you're 'round I can smell it in you 
 She's got that true blood 
 I come around and raise the hell out of you 
 It's the demon next to me that's got me screaming 
 Make me wanna build a coffin for two 
 She's got that true blood 
 But baby, I just do it for the thrill out of you 
 It makes me say 
 Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha... 
 It makes me say 
 Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha... 
 Now I feel my fever on the rise 
 And the bones in my body start to quake 
 Straight up from my toes to my mind 
 She controls me but I don't want to escape 
 All the other ones that have tried 
 Find out that they have made their final mistake 
 But when she got a bite of my type 
 She told me that she found her perfect blood mate 
 Give it to me now 
 So evil in the dress 
 It circulates you start to feel it 
 Devil in the flesh 
 Once she starts to invoke the spirits 
 Got you on the floor 
 She comes alive when you're the killing 
 Hungry for some more 
 Hey, I think she's got that true blood 
 Every time you're 'round I can smell it in you 
 She's got that true blood 
 I come around and raise the hell out of you

 But baby, I just do it for the thrill out of you 
 It makes me say 
 Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha... 
 It makes me say 
 Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha... 
 Your pheromones invaded my instinct 
 I stalked your scent like an animal 
 Roast me in your perfection, I'm mad, I don't wanna think 
 'Cause the others wanna burn with me but they don't hold a candle 
 It feels like 
 The others wanna burn with me but they don't hold a candle 
 Ooh sometimes it feels like 
 Smells so funky 
 Guitar 
 Give it to me 
 Break

 On my Eddie Murphy Boomerang for ya 
 Got a bunch of old girls that I threw away for ya

 Pole in my bedroom that was there when I moved in 
 Okay fine, I'm a terrible liar

 You the girl that's gonna be there when it's marrying time 
 And I'm gonna fuck you like we are having an affair

 Say this is a private show, oh boy don't start 
 Keep it soul stripping things slipping like a pole vault 
 North pole boy from the T.O.

 Cook for ya and then I break it down like a kilo

 When did all the fire turn colder? 
 When did your heart start to beat slower?

 And every tomorrow, maybe you'll let me borrow your heart 
 And is it too much to ask for every Sunday 
 If I were radical and every other day to start 
 I know people make promises all the time 
 Then they turn right around and break them 
 When someone cuts your heart open with a knife, while you beating 
 But I could be that guy to heal it over time 
 And I won't stop until you believe it 
 'Cause baby you're worth it 
 So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me 
 'Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true, with me 
 Spend all your time and your money just find out my love was free 
 So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me, me 
 It's not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me 
 Now how about I'd be the last voice you hear at night? 
 And every other night for the rest of the nights that there are 
 Every morning I just wanna see you staring back at me 
 'Cause I know that's a good place to start 
 I know people make promises all the time 
 Then they turn right around and break them 
 When someone cuts your heart open with a knife, while you beating

 These arms of mine

 Your hand slides down the light

 I brag about you to anyone outside

 I'm sorry baby, you know I try 
 But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride 
 Well, I got your sweet with a twist of lime 
 And this one's neat, well you know that's mine, here we go 
 And do it twice 'cause you know we like it 
 And damn anybody if they disagree 
 They don't understand you're just like me, they don't know 
 We do it twice 'cause we know we like it 
 But then your hands talking, fingers walking, down your legs 
 Hey, there's the faucet

 I'm sorry baby, you know I try 
 But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride 
 How do I ever explain what I've got with you? 
 I try to find the words but they hide and that's the truth 
 And nobody ever will understand what we do 
 There's only one me and you 
 Come here, hold me 
 'Cause there's only one me and you 
 Yeah, there's only one me and you, uh 
 There's only one me and you 
 You know there's only one me and you 
 I brag about you to anyone outside 
 But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride 
 I'm sorry baby, you know I try 
 But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride 
 I wrote this to let you know 
 And I let them feelings show 
 I'm the man of the woods and you're my pride 
 Ooh, I can't make them understand 
 But you know I'm a Southern man 
 A man of the woods and you're my pride

 Are the, the memories of the past that I wasn't there for 
 But, that somehow I, I, I feel like I understand more when it's against my skin 
 It's an armor, like a barrier from the world 
 Like, our secret nobody else knows and I like that, you know? 
 It makes me feel like a woman, it makes me feel sexy, it makes me feel...

 I wish it was night, a struggle and a fight 
 When I saw her there was a good affair 
 She's so nice, she's so cool, I don't think she's a fool 
 When I saw her last time, was a day at school 
 But at school it isn't fine, yeah the school isn't cool 
 I was drunken that night, without thinking about 
 I was really gone 'cause we had much fun 
 Without thinking about, I went go more far 
 I was really almost, knocked down by a car 
 I would take her, I would find her, she's my target 
 The way I want her, and her money, that's sounds funny 
 I would take her, I would find her, she's my target 
 The way I want her, and her money, that's sounds funny 
 I hope her friends like me, or do they hate me 
 My friends don't like her, but I really don't care 
 She is more important, than my stupid friends 
 They can say what they want to, 
 just do what you want to!

 Now, I don't wanna fight with you 
 I've done everything I can do (everything I can do)

 But girl the way we fight, it just ain't right 
 That's why it's better this way (hehey hehey yeah yeah yeah) 
 Now no what else to say, but girl you know that

 The Earth is a little place next to my love

78,Justin Timberlake,pop,Come And Touch,"Ow oh oh oh oh yeah 
 Oh you're already here 
 Haven't seen you for a couple of days 
 So let me tell you something 
 And when I start taking my clothes off 
 Touching myself and taking a shower 
 I wanna be alone and I don't need a girl 
 To feel the way I wanna feel 
 And I don't want you to feel the way I feel 
 I just wanna have some fun with a couple of guys 
 My touch is just a body language 
 So exciting so inviting 
 Wanna go I just need oh 
 And when I say so you say no 
 And when I say no you say so 
 Just better you would say 
 Hey baby boy you're sexy 
 But you keep saying 
 You're a little bit sassy 
 Sissy boy come to me 
 Oh you melt in my arm like a butter ah 
 Tryin' to keep you 
 Don't want you to disappear 
 Just tryin' to catch your smell 
 Your voice is just so mellow 
 Why are your steps so..? Hallow! 
 Don't know if you're a girl 
 And I don't even care 
 Come and touch touch me closer 
 One more time twice 
 I don't wanna dance 
 Make no scence 
 Do you hear my lamentation? 
 How? Keep me in your arms 
 Just put your hand on my chest 
 And tell me what you feel 
 Just look in my eyes 
 And tell me what you see 
 That silence between us will be for a while 
 And you know what I mean 
 And you know what I have seen 
 Haven't seen you for a couple of days 
 So let me tell you something 
 Let me touch you with my finger tips 
 Let me shake my hips 
 Am I about lips? 
 Chocolate sticks 
 Just lose control 
 And follow my lead 
 Come closer closer yo come closer"
79,Justin Timberlake,pop,Confused,"My Knees start to shakewhen you're in sight 
 My mind is filled with wonder 
 My heart with fright 
 When will this feeling stop 
 When did it start 
 How can I listhe to my mind 
 Without breaking my heart 
 I'm so confused 
 What should I do 
 I can't think of anything 
 Except you 
 Should I ignore you or just give it time 
 I can't thaink straight my heart controls my mind"
80,Justin Timberlake,pop,Crowd Control,"Listen now I'm talking 
 I've been here for weeks 
 Waiting in this growing crowd 
 Staring at my feet 
 The world around me is turning 
 I'm just standing still 
 The time has come for changes 
 Do something or I will 
 I'm a feather in a storm 
 I'm a rain drop in the sea 
 If I don't get enough of you 
 I'm a lighter shade of me 
 Sisters, brothers all around you 
 There's a devil in the crowd 
 Meet his eye and it's the end of time 
 If you're praying don't be loud 
 Its crowded in the lowland 
 But the fools stay on the hill 
 You control us now 
 You got the reins 
 Do something or we will 
 So show us why we came here 
 Before we lay on the ground 
 Give it to us loud and clear 
 Make the devil turn around"

 She's that uptown girl with the cocky persona.

 And I wouldn't break her heart, my intentions ARE better, 
 And I shared the same dreams she had about cheddar. 
 When the G's came she was down to hold the bEretta, 
 I got a thing for baby girl, it's me a her against the world, whoo!

 And I got just the one 
 Something to show you that you are second to none 
 To all the fellas out there with ladies to impress 
 It's easy to do 
 Just follow these steps: 
 One: 
 Cut a hole in a box 
 Two: 
 Put your junk in that box 
 Three: 
 Make her open the box 
 And that's the way you do it

 Backstage at the CMAs, a dick in a box 
 Yeah 
 A dick in a box 
 Dick in a box

85,Justin Timberlake,pop,Dead And Gone,"Ay 
 Let me kick it to you right quick, man 
 That on some gangsta shit man, on some real shit 
 Anybody done been through the same thing, I'm sure you feel the same way 
 Big Phil 
 This for you pimpin' 
 Chorus (Justin Timberlake (T.I.)): 
 Oh (ey) 
 I've been travellin' on this road too long (too long) 
 Just tryna find my way back home (back home) 
 The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone 
 And oh (ey) 
 I've been travellin' on this road too long (too long) 
 Just tryna find my way back home (back home) 
 The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, dead and gone 
 (Verse 1 - T.I.) 
 Ever had one of them days wish would've stayed home 
 Run into a group of niggas who gettin' they hate on 
 You walk by 
 They get wrong 
 You reply then shit get blown 
 Way outta proportion 
 Way past discussion 
 Just you against them, pick one then rush 'em 
 Figure you'll get jumped, hell that's nothing 
 They don't wanna stop there now they bussin' 
 Now you gushin', ambulance rushin' 
 You to the hospital with a bad concussion 
 Plus ya hit 4 times 
 Plus it hit ya spine 
 Paralyzed waist down now ya wheel chair bound 
 Nevermind that now you lucky to be alive 
 Just think it all started you fussin' with 3 guys 
 Now ya pride in the way, but ya pride is the way 
 You could fuck around, get shot, die anyday 
 Niggas die everyday 
 All over bull shit, dope money, dice game, ordinary hood shit 
 Could this be 'cause of hip hop music? 
 Or did the ones with the good sense not use it? 
 Usually niggas don't know what to do when their back against the wall so they just start shootin' 
 For red or for blue or for blo I guess 
 From Bankhead or from your projects 
 No more stress, now I'm straight, now I get it, now I take 
 Time to think, before I make mistakes just for my family's sake 
 That part of me left yesterday 
 The heart of me is strong today 
 No regrets I'm blessed to say 
 The old me dead and gone away 
 (Chorus (Justin Timberlake (T.I.))) 
 (Verse 2 - T.I.) 
 I ain't never been scared, I lived through tragedy 
 Situation could've been dead lookin' back at it 
 Most of that shit didn't even have to happen 
 But you don't think about it when you out there trappin' 
 In apartments, hangin', smokin', and rappin' 
 Niggas start shit, next thing ya know we cappin' 
 Get locked up then didn't even get mad 
 Now think about damn what a life I had 
 Most of that shit, look back, just laugh 
 Some shit still look back get sad 
 Maybe my homboy still be around 
 Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time 
 I won that fight 
 I lost that war 
 I can still see my nigga walkin' out that door 
 Who'da thought I'd never see Philant no more? 
 Got enough dead homies I don't want no more 
 Cost a nigga his job 
 Cost me more 
 I'd took that ass-whooping now for sure 
 Now think before I risk my life 
 Take them chances to get my stripe 
 A nigga put his hands on me all right 
 Otherwise stand there talk shit all night 
 'Cause I hit you, you sue me, 
 I shoot you, get locked up, who me? 
 No more stress, now I'm straight, now I get it, now I take 
 Time to think, before I make mistakes just for my family's sake 
 That part of me left yesterday 
 The heart of me is strong today 
 No regrets I'm blessed to say 
 The old me dead and gone away 
 (Chorus (Justin Timberlake (T.I.))) 
 (Hook - Justin Timberlake) 
 I turn my head to the East 
 I don't see nobody by my side 
 I turn my head to the West 
 Still nobody in sight 
 So I turn my head to the North 
 Swallow that pill that they call pride 
 That old me is dead and gone 
 But that new me will be all right 
 I turn my head to the East 
 I don't see nobody by my side 
 I turn my head to the West 
 Still nobody in sight 
 So I turn my head to the North 
 Swallow that pill that they call pride 
 That old me is dead and gone 
 But that new me will be all right 
 (Chorus (Justin Timberlake (T.I.)))"

 All I can say is how I feel,

 How I would want if you would go,

 Is our love forever? 
 Can anyone ever know? 
 For all I remember I never have felt love so, 
 So deeply, deeply. 
 Our love is made by two 
 And I can't make it without you,

 You gotta show me that you're only ever gonna be mine

90,Justin Timberlake,pop,Gone,"There's a thousand words that 
 I could say, to make you come home, yeah 
 Seems so long ago you walked away 
 Left me alone 
 And I remember what you said to me, 
 You were acting so strange 
 And maybe I was too blind to see 
 That you needed a change 
 Was it something I said to make you turn away 
 To make you walk out and leave me cold 
 If I could just find a way 
 To make it so that you were right here, right now 
 I've been sitting here 
 Can't get you off my mind 
 I'm trying my best to be a man and be strong 
 I drove myself insane, wishing I could touch your face 
 But the truth remains, you're Gone 
 Now I don't wanna make excuses, baby 
 Won't change the fact that you're gone 
 But if there's something that I could do, won't you please let me know 
 Time is passing so slowly now, guess that's my life without you 
 And maybe I could change my everyday, but baby I don't want to 
 So I'll just hang around and find some things to do 
 To take my mind off missing you 
 And I know in my heart, you can't say that you don't love me too 
 Please say you do, yeah 
 What will I do if I can't be with you 
 Tell me where will I turn to, baby who will I be 
 Now that we are apart, am I still in your heart?

 Well, it's not, you didn't count on a fallen angel 
 Getting back into the grace of God and coming after you 
 Y'all niggaz ain't shit, your producers ain't shit 
 Your fucking A&R ain't shit 
 I'll fucking wipe my ass with your demo deal 
 Yo, Diabolic, take this mother fucker's head off 
 Go ahead and grip glocks 
 I'll snap your trigger finger in six spots 
 You'll have to lip lock 
 With hypodermic needles to lick shots 
 I'll watch you topple flat 
 Put away your rings and holla back 
 Can't freestyle, you're screwed off the top like bottle caps 
 Beneath the surface 
 I'm over heating your receiving circuits 
 By unleashing deeper verses than priests speak in churches 
 What you preach is worthless 
 Your worship defeat the purpose 
 Like President Bush taking bullets for the Secret Service 
 Beyond what y'all fathom 
 I shit on cats and jaw tap at 'em 
 Show no compassion like having a straight faced orgasm 
 Tour jack at 'em 
 Have his half a ten, bitch suck my friend's dick 
 In the mean time, you can French kiss this clenched fist 
 Diabolic, a one man brigade spreading cancer plague 
 This fucking a pussy's face, holding a hand grenade 
 So if I catch you bluffin', faggot, you're less than nothing 
 I just had to get that stress off my chest like breast reduction 
 You mother fuckers are nothing 
 You cannot harm me 
 I'll resurrect every aborted baby and start an army 
 Storm the planet hunting you down 'cause I'm on a mission 
 To split your body into a billion one-celled organisms 
 Immortal Technique will destroy your religion, you stupid bitch 
 You're faker than blue-eyed crackers nailed to a crucifix 
 I'm 'bout to blow up like NASA Challenger computer chips 
 Arsenic language transmitted revolutionarily 
 I'm like time itself, I'm gonna kill you inevitably 
 Chemically bomb you, fuck using a chrome piece 
 I'm Illmatic, you won't make it home like Jerome's niece 
 I'll sever your head diagonally for thinking of dissin' me 
 And then I'll use your dead body to write my name in calligraphy 
 This public democracy, brain washed your psychology 
 So you're nothing like diversity without equality 
 And your crew is full of more faggots than Greek mythology 
 Using numerology to count the people I sent to Heaven 
 Produces more digits than 22 divided by 7 
 You're like Kevin Spacey, your style is usually suspect 
 You never killed a cop, you not a mother fucking thug yet 
 Your mind is empty and spacious 
 Like the part of the brain, the appreciated culture in a racist 
 Face it, you too basic, you're never gonna make it 
 Like children walking through Antarctica butt naked"

94,Justin Timberlake,pop,Hootnanny,"I could go number one ten times 
 Pretty girls that like my rhymes 
 You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine 
 Guess wha, wha, don't really give a hootnanny 
 I could go number one ten times 
 Pretty girls that like my rhymes 
 You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine 
 Guess wha, wha, don't really give a hootnanny 
 Now I done banged a heap of Betties in various modes of transport 
 'N told them as they exit be sure that they close the damn door 
 The quiet country types is usually those I'm scared for[??] 
 Some scared at first, but usually those demand more 
 Really ain't conceited, I just call myself the cutterbug 
 A horny little parasite that all the women love to love 
 Tell you what it is today, I ain't concerned with what it was 
 Bubba fixin' to get it done, I put that on my brother ?? 
 Hear them in the closet, in the kitchen, justa whisperin' 
 Bubba so psst psst knowing that I'm listening 
 I ain't gotta chain, boy my peck[?] is all that's glistenin' 
 Whachu steamin' on folk, y'all ain't even disciplined 
 I ain't leaving nothin', this the house me and my people built 
 Huggin' me and dappin' me, buddy I can see your guilt 
 It's cold when you're wrong and you lookin' like you need a quilt 
 Y'all matter less every time this margarita tilt 
 I could go number one ten times 
 Pretty girls that like my rhymes 
 You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine 
 Guess wha, wha, don't really give a hootnanny 
 I could go number one ten times 
 Pretty girls that like my rhymes 
 You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine 
 Guess wha, wha, don't really give a hootnanny 
 A lot of y'all was thinkin' that Bubba would probably disappear 
 Get some show money from UGLY and buy a keg of beer 
 And another pig to give my other pigs some company 
 Rent a doublewide and just live it out in luxary 
 In due time, but there's business left to attend to 
 I need another farm to bequeath my next of kin to 
 And another ? before my great aunt Missy 
 Yeah, I've been drinkin' but I ain't that pissy 
 Thinkin' back to when my daddy told me what it's all about 
 He said no matter what I do in life, some of y'all'll pout 
 I can deal with that long as all my folks is eatin' good 
 Let that channel pass over more than any Easter could 
 I'm on the roll again and I ain't talkin' ecstacy 
 Tell them folks at Interscope they fixin' to write some checks to me 
 Soon as me and Timmy finish up this latest pig schlop 
 Man I think you right, it ain't nothing but some hen??? 
 I could go number one ten times 
 Pretty girls that like my rhymes 
 You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine 
 Guess wha, wha, don't really give a hootnanny 
 I could go number one ten times 
 Pretty girls that like my rhymes 
 You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine 
 Guess wha, wha, don't really give a hootnanny 
 I'm back off in the saddle with smile and that cajolery 
 Mama always knew how big a stallion I would grow to be 
 Way beyond these suckers both lyrically and vocally 
 I doubted for a moment, now it's clear to me I'm supposed to be 
 An uncanny whit plus a time that is impeccable 
 Make the sharpest cat feel his mind is just a vegetable 
 How does Bubba do it, you won't find it in a manual 
 Confused them all at first so this time is understandable 
 Staring at the ceiling fan, pondering my future now 
 Wondering what the hell to do with all this loot I found 
 Got my tractor polished up and I'm as drunk as Cooter Brown 
 Navigating yet another one of Timmy's supersounds 
 I could go number one ten times 
 Pretty girls that like my rhymes 
 You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine 
 Guess wha, wha, don't really give a hootnanny 
 I could go number one ten times 
 Pretty girls that like my rhymes 
 You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine 
 Guess wha, wha, don't really give a hootnanny..."

 And how you looked into my eyes 
 I wish I couldn take back all those things I said 
 But now all I can do is apologize 
 But that's not enough...

 Plenty fish in the sea, baby please know that. 
 And the dude that you with, 
 Baby he's no threat. 
 His stacks on d's, my g's on deck.

 Just gotta get up under her dress."

 There 're so many times I've let you down 
 So many times I've played around 
 But now you know that they don't mean a thing 
 Every place I go, I'll think of you 
 Every song I sing, I'll sing for you 
 When I come back I'll wear your wedding ring 
 So kiss me and smile for me

 Hold me like you'll never let me go 
 I'm leaving on a jet plane 
 Don't know when I'll be back again

 Now the time has come to leave you 
 One more time, let me kiss you 
 Close your eyes and I'll be on my way 
 Dream about the days to come 
 When I won't have to leave alone, 
 About the times when I don't have to say...: 
 So kiss me and smile for me 
 Tell me that you'll wait for me

 I kind of noticed, from one night 
 From the club, your front face 
 It's kind of weird to me 
 Since you're so fine 
 If it's up to me your face will change 
 If you smiling, that should set the tone 
 Just be limber 
 If you let go, the music should groove your bones 
 Just remember 
 Sing this song with me 
 Ain't nobody love you like I love you 
 You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya 
 Late at night, I talk to you 
 You will know the difference when I touch you 
 People are so phony 
 Nosy 'cause they're lonely 
 Aren't you sick of the same thing? 
 They say so and so was dating 
 Love you or they're hatin' 
 When it doesn't matter anyway 
 'Cause we're here tonight

 Look at me, I say ""yeah, it's the same dough"" 
 We the same type, you my air of life 
 You have sleepin' in the same bed, every night 
 Go rock with me, you deserve the best 
 Take a few shots 
 Let it burn in your chest 
 We could ride down 
 Pumpin' N.E.R.D. in the deck 
 Funny how a few words turn into sex 
 Play this free, joint called ""brain"" 
 Ma, take a hint 
 Make me swerve in the lane 
 The name Malicious 
 And I burn every track 
 Clipse and J. Timberlake 
 Now how heavy is that? 
 Maybe we'll fly tonight (I just want to love you baby) 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Maybe we'll fly tonight (I just want to love you baby)

 Ain't nobody love you like I love you 
 You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya 
 Late at night, I talk to you 
 You will know the difference when I touch you

 You know, I used to dream about this when I was a 
 Little boy 
 I never thought it would end up this way, [drums]

 Girl you're deep inside each day 
 Waiting for the courage 
 That never came 
 So on you went without a clue 
 That these adoring eyes they long for you 
 I tried to get real close to you 
 Hoping that you would see through 
 My disguise 
 And somehow you know that I 
 I adored ya 
 Though I never laid my hands on you 
 My eyes adored ya 
 My eyes adored ya 
 Like you couldn't see 
 A millions miles away 
 How I adored ya 
 So close (so close) 
 So close and yet so far 
 You looked at me 
 And saw a friend 
 You told me things 
 And I'd have to pretend 
 That you didn't mean 
 The world to me 
 And all the while 
 Behind the scenes 
 I cried with you 
 And lived your every dream 
 Yes I did 
 The reality 
 The hope's still there 
 And dreams run wild 
 I'll make time to 
 So tell me, tell me baby 
 Was I a fool 
 Do your eyes adore me, too"

 All I want is to have you here with me every night, every day 
 When you talk, I hang on every word you say 
 When you move, you're like the breeze on a summer day

 They say that the eyes are The windows to the soul 
 So I finally chose the just in me 
 Why didn't I see you coming? 
 I'll miss the vision where you stood 
 And I would touch you if I could 
 But your lips keep sayin', What your heart will never do 
 Someone tell me how can a girl as Fine as you be so cold 
 And treat me like you do? 
 I'm still lost in your every move 
 It's just too bad that you're no good 
 (Just don't tell that you love me 
 I know that it's just not true) 
 No 
 (You gotta give it to me 
 'Cause you've got me ...) 
 What the hell a man's to do? 
 Seduction at its finest 
 Has stripped away all of my dignity 
 So beautiful 
 How you whisper 
 (Is there any good between you and me?) 
 No I never imagined myself 
 In this state of mind 
 I'm stuck between a dream and nightmare 
 Help 'cause you've rendered me blind 
 Why didn't I see you coming?"
122,Justin Timberlake,pop,What Goes Around... Come Around (Interlude),"Hey girl, is he everything you wanted in a man? 
 You know I gave you the world 
 You had me in the palm of your hand 
 So why your love went away 
 I just can't seem to understand 
 Thought it was me and you babe 
 Me and you until the end 
 But I guess I was wrong 
 Don't want to think about it 
 Don't want to talk about it 
 I'm just so sick about it 
 Can't believe it's ending this way 
 Just so confused about it 
 Feeling the blues about it 
 I just can't do without ya 
 Tell me is this fair? 
 Is this the way it's really going down? 
 Is this how we say goodbye? 
 Should've known better when you came around 
 That you were gonna make me cry 
 It's breaking my heart to watch you run around 
 'Cause I know that you're living a lie 
 That's okay baby 'cause in time you will find... 
 What goes around, goes around, goes around 
 Comes all the way back around 
 What goes around, goes around, goes around 
 Comes all the way back around 
 What goes around, goes around, goes around 
 Comes all the way back around 
 What goes around, goes around, goes around 
 Comes all the way back around 
 Now girl, I remember everything that you claimed 
 You said that you were moving on now 
 And maybe I should do the same 
 Funny thing about that is 
 I was ready to give you my name 
 Thought it was me and you, babe 
 And now, it's all just a shame 
 And I guess I was wrong 
 Don't want to think about it 
 Don't want to talk about it 
 I'm just so sick about it 
 Can't believe it's ending this way 
 Just so confused about it 
 Feeling the blues about it

 (Comes Around interlude) 
 Let me paint this picture for you, baby 
 You spend your nights alone 
 And he never comes home 
 And every time you call him 
 All you get's a busy tone 
 I heard you found out 
 That he's doing to you 
 What you did to me 
 Ain't that the way it goes 
 When you cheated girl 
 My heart bleeded girl 
 So it goes without saying that you left me feeling hurt 
 Just a classic case 
 A scenario 
 Tale as old as time 
 Girl you got what you deserved 
 And now you want somebody 
 To cure the lonely nights 
 You wish you had somebody 
 That could come and make it right 
 But girl I ain't somebody with a lot of sympathy 
 You'll see 
 (What goes around comes back around) 
 I thought I told ya, hey 
 (What goes around comes back around) 
 I thought I told ya, hey 
 (What goes around comes back around) 
 I thought I told ya, hey 
 (What goes around comes back around) 
 I thought I told ya, hey 
 (Laughs) 
 See? 
 You should have listened to me, baby 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Because 
 (What goes around comes back around) 
 (Laughs)"
123,Justin Timberlake,pop,Words I Say,"Sometimes I can't believe what I am seeing 
 But I always see love that you are giving to me 
 And I still don't know what lead me to you 
 But I know this, this was meant to be 
 And girl in your smile I see my everything 
 But if the words I say 
 Make the tears roll down 
 And they find their way to your heart down 
 Your lips can say enough 
 The tongue controls my mouth 
 And over this ... Is that 
 In the corners of your mouth 
 Tu tu tu tu 
 Sometimes I can't believe the things I say to you 
 But baby every word is true yes it is 
 And when you kiss me it's all over 
 You put me under I didn't know that love can hurt so good 
 And girl in your smile I see my everything 
 But if the words I say 
 Make the tears roll down 
 And they find their way to your heart down 
 Your lips can say enough 
 The tongue controls my mouth 
 And over this ... Is that 
 In the corners of your mouth"

 What your faith in me 
 Has done for my soul 
 You'll never know the gift you've given me 
 I'll carry it with me yeah yeah 
 Through the days ahead I'll think of days before 
 And you make me hope for something better and made me reach for something more

 And your love is the music of my heart 
 You were the one always on my side (always on my side) 
 Always standin by (always standin by) 
 Seein me through 
 You were the song that always made me sing 
 I'm singin' this for you 
 Everywhere I go I think of where I've been 
 And of the one who knew me better that anyone ever will again

 To something I've never known before 
 And your love is the music of my heart 
 What you taught me only your love could ever teach me 
 You got through when could reach me before 
 Cause you always saw in me all the best that I could be 
 It was you who set me freeeeeee 
 You taught me to run you taught me to fly 
 Helped me to free the me inside 
 Helped me hear the music of my heart

 Is the music of my heart"
125,Justin Timberlake,pop,You Weren't There,"A Song That I Wrote That Justin Sang! 
 I'm sitting here alone 
 Asking myself what am I doing? 
 I'm crying here alone 
 Asking myself what to do next 
 See I was good to you 
 But you did not except that 
 And I did for you 
 All the things I can 
 You Weren't there 
 To help me through 
 You Weren't there 
 To love me too 
 I'm sitting here, alone asking myself what to do 
 You weren't there 
 I can't believe you are 
 Having fun with some other guy 
 And there is not no more 
 Hope in this stupid relationship 
 See I was good to you 
 But you did not except that 
 And I did for you 
 All the things I can 
 You Weren't there 
 To help me through 
 You Weren't there 
 To love me too 
 I'm sitting here, alone asking myself what to do 
 You weren't there 
 You weren't there to help me through 
 Girl I'm lost without you 
 I can't believe you just slammed the door 
 I'm not takin' this s*** no more 
 Now I see your having fun 
 This relationship will be done! 
 You Weren't there 
 To help me through 
 You Weren't there 
 To love me too 
 I'm sitting here, alone asking myself what to do 
 You weren't there 
 Oh no, no, no, no 
 You Weren't there 
 No, No, No, No 
 You weren't there"
126,Justin Timberlake,pop,You're My Light,"Dum dum dum dum dum-dum 
 Do... 
 Do... Ooh... 
 You're still captivating even though it's been so long 
 You used to love me tell me baby what went wrong 
 'Cause now you march to the beat of a different song 
 Try to understand that we needed space 
 But everywhere I turn I see your face 
 I've been waiting for you to come home 
 'Cause I don't want to be alone 
 I still love you 
 Why did you take away your love 
 When did you think to just give up 
 How am I supposed to carry on now 
 Without you 
 You are my light 
 I have changed girl since I last saw you 
 When you left you don't know what you put me through 
 But my heart's still racing just being next to you 
 I can't escape the magic in your eyes 
 Is there a way to make you realize 
 There's no one more special to my heart 
 But you want us to be apart 
 I still love you 
 Why did you take away your love, baby 
 When did you think to just give up, yeah 
 How am I supposed to carry on now 
 Without you 
 You were my world 
 You meant everything to me 
 You're the air I breathe 
 The song I sing 
 You were my queen, I was your king 
 But if we can try to work it out 
 We'll show the world what love is about 
 Baby come on 'cause I can't take no more 
 Of this loneliness 
 And emptiness 
 Why did you take away your love 
 (Take away your love) 
 When did you think to just give up 
 (Oh...) 
 How am I supposed to carry on now 
 Without you 
 Why did you take away your love 
 When did you think to just give up 
 How am I supposed to carry on 
 Without you 
 You are my 
 You are my light"
