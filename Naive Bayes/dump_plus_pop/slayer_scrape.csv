 No one can stop us tonight

 Attacking once more now with twice as much strength 
 We conquer then move on ahead

 Evil will take your soul

 Satan our master in evil mayhem 
 Guides us with every first step

 Consuming all that we can

 Can't see living this lie no, a world I haunt 
 You've lost all control of my heart and soul 
 Satan holds my future, watch it unfold 
 I am the Antichrist 
 It's what I was meant to be 
 Your God left me behind 
 And set my soul to be free 
 Watching disciples of the Satanic rule 
 Pentagram of blood holds the jackals truth 
 Searching for the answer Christ hasn't come 
 Awaiting the final moment the birth of Satan's Son 
 Screams from a life I live 
 Torment is what I give 
 Torture is what I love 
 The downfall of the heavens above 
 I am the Antichrist

 Raping the maids, in which they serve 
 Only the words of the Lord 
 Die by the sword 
 Die by the sword 
 Satan watches all of us 
 Smiles as some do his bidding 
 Try to escape the grasp of my hand 
 And your life will no longer exist 
 Hear our cry, save us from 
 The hell in which we live 
 We turn our heads toward the sky 
 And listen for the steel 
 Die by the sword 
 Die by the sword 
 Watch as flowers decay 
 On (the) cryptic life that died 
 The wisdom of the wizards 
 Is only a neurtured lie 
 Black knights of Hell's domain 
 Walk upon the dead

 The blood on which he feeds

 Beneath the cold of the frozen star 
 You feel the fright, you know I'm near 
 You never should have come this far 
 I am alive, you can't kill me 
 I will survive eternity 
 Go through the fire walk past the dead 
 Lost in my eternal maze 
 Your heart pounds through the mist filled air 
 Your concentration breaks for me to strike 
 You've cowered down, you've broken the chain 
 Now I can freeze your burning eyes 
 You see me lift the axe, (as) it plunges through your shield 
 You now begin to panic as you see your chances grow slim 
 Your running through the endless maze 
 (You) Turn and I'll be there 
 A force too strong for you to fight 
 Your end I'll see tonight (""I'll see your end tonight"") 
 You think you can destroy (me)? You'd better think again 
 I am eternal terror my quest will never end

 Blinding my eyes 
 Twisting my mind 
 Fight to resist the evil inside 
 Captive of a force of Satan's might 
 A force of Satan's might 
 Fighting the curse 
 Break it I must 
 Laughing in sorrow 
 Crying in lust

 Soon I must fall 
 Victim of fortune 
 My sources grow small 
 Life slips away 
 As demons come forth 
 Death takes my hand 
 And captures my soul"

 I slowly surround you 
 As terror sets in 
 Are you afraid of the night 
 I see the fright in your eyes 
 As you turn and run 
 But is your mind playing tricks 
 On a body so very young 
 Feeling as if no one cares 
 The fear runs down your spine 
 But I know I'll never rest 
 Until I know you're mine

 He makes his move to conquer the land 
 Turning all hopes of life to sand 
 Machine gun fire, blood level higher 
 Visions of torture and terror to all

 I've fallen from promises, damned to take risks on my own 
 The masterful science that freezes your mind and your soul 
 The wretched dream is realized 
 The human race is to be crystallized 
 Thoughts of laughter 
 Filling the head of the master in charge 
 Worlds of wonder 
 Is this a cure or a painless death? 
 I'll fight and resist till they all see the end that is near 
 The doctors, the lawyers and G-men are living in fear 
 Living my life with one distant hope 
 A cure that will kill my invincible foe"

 You think you'll see the pearly gates 
 When death takes you away 
 For all respect you cannot lust 
 In an invisible man you place your trust 
 Indirect dependency 
 Eternal attempt at amnesty 
 He will decide who lives and dies 
 Depopulate Satanas rise 
 You will be an accessory 
 Irreverence and blasphemy

 The gates of pearl have turned to gold 
 It seems you've lost your way 
 Jesus saves, No words of praise 
 No promised land to take you to 
 There is no other way"

 Counting off deaths toll 
 Laughing as you eternally rot

 Then death will come and all will be lost 
 Can you hear the serpents call 
 Look deep in those deceiving eyes 
 Ignore the writing on the wall 
 You should read between the lies 
 When doubt subsides his honesty 
 An inquiry, Is it blasphemy? 
 Impure the soul, That's made to suffer

 The need to hate 
 Dead stare through cynical eyes 
 A trust in only pain 
 Murder within the skin

 I'm suicidal, maniacal, self-destructive 
 You leave me no hope, no life 
 Nothing worth living for 
 I've taken it, can't take it anymore 
 My worst nightmare 
 You make me want to slit my own fucking throat 
 Just so I'll be rid of you 
 Just to get rid of you 
 You self-righteous fuck 
 Give me a reason not to rip your fucking face off 
 Why don't you take a good look in these eyes 
 'Cause I'm the one that's gonna tear your fucking heart out 
 My hate is contagious; you've got no one to run to 
 Exile, exile, exile, exile 
 Just tell me fucking why everything becomes an issue 
 Your opinion is always senseless - fuck this 
 You make my fucking skin crawl 
 I've lived with it, can't stand anymore 
 My worst nightmare 
 I want to take a bullet in the fucking head 
 Every time I think of you, every time I think of you 
 You self-righteous fuck 
 Give me a reason not to rip your fucking face off 
 Why don't you take a good look in these eyes 
 'Cause I'm the one that's gonna tear your fucking heart out 
 My hate is contagious 
 Anyone else need to vent? 
 You've tried my tolerance, I just want you to die 
 There's nothing more for me to say 
 There's nothing more for you to say 
 There's nothing more for us to say 
 I fucking hate you anyway 
 Exile, exile, exile, exile 
 Can't count the ways that you light my fuckin' fuse 
 I can't tolerate the sight of you, the thought of you or anything about you 
 You know what I want to see? 
 How many ways can a loser fucking lose 
 I know you'll find a way 
 The humility awakening the idiot inside 
 You spineless fucking maggot - you're just wasting my time 
 Get out of my face, get out of my life 
 Out of my fucking way, just die"
98,Slayer,metal,Seven Faces,"I saw them all around today 
 They don't stop, they won't go away 
 They love the darkness in my eyes 
 Help me find a way out when I'm lost within myself 
 Lost within myself, when I'm lost within myself 
 They show me everything I need 
 There's nothing wrong with a little greed 
 Never enough to satisfy 
 Such a driving desire that burns inside 
 My life came with it's own scars 
 I don't need you to tell me about your sorrow 
 I can't say I've seen it all 
 But I live for the things that keep me hollow 
 Everyday I look into the mirror 
 Staring back I look less familiar 
 I've seen all seven faces 
 Each one looks a lot like me 
 They all look like me 
 I never see them coming but they show me more of myself 
 Drawn into the depths I never knew existed 
 Launching me face first into the pleasures of pure lust and greed 
 I am becoming all things envied, I am the excess 
 I want it all more pain, more sex, more lies 
 More of everything 
 My life came with its own scars 
 I don't need you to tell me about your sorrow 
 I can't say I've seen it all 
 But I live for the things that keep me hollow 
 Everyday I looked into the mirror 
 Staring back I look less familiar 
 I've seen all seven faces 
 Each one looks a lot like me

 Searching for a cryptic bride 
 Eat alive the conscience I hate

 Face the dead and dying 
 Feel your life drain 
 Through your soul 
 Seek salvation from an mia god 
 Empty vessels chanting for the dead 
 Death is yours 
 Your veins have dried 
 Staring eyes of glass now empty 
 Still you speak with lips so cold

 Branded and scarred defy, defy 
 A comatose and blind existence 
 Hatred holocaust you see in me 
 Its more than just a way of life 
 I've re-invented the way 
 I relate to this complacent world 
 All of life decays 
 Rapes my eyes 
 Screams never silence the pain 
 Death is like an old friend 
 I can't wait to watch you die 
 I am you vice so real, so real 
 Desires of the scars of new flesh 
 Bathe in you blood excites/incites 
 The ritualistic lacerations 
 Inhumanities profane, insane 
 Inflicted since the dawn of time 
 Make your peace with God - goodbye 
 And embrace the pain that burns inside you 
 All of life decays 
 Rapes my eyes 
 Screams never silence the pain 
 Death is like an old friend 
 I can't wait to watch you die

 Come step inside my hate you know there's nothing to it 
 Step inside my pain you'll never make it through it 
 Redefine your life in sado-paradise 
 Necessary cleansing of the mind's eye 
 Love and agony electric ecstasy 
 Can't get enough euphoric serenity 
 Stains won't fade away forever scarstruck 
 They never fade away forever scarstruck 
 Drown in my hate you know, you know 
 Brutality's the way of this world 
 Branded and scarred defy, defy 
 A comatose and blind existence 
 You're like the walking dead so blind inside 
 Oblivious to psycho pleasure 
 I am your new God - unGod 
 So if you want hell here I am 
 Everything around me decays 
 Rapes my eyes 
 Screams never silence the pain 
 Make you my canvas of pure, fresh, flesh

 I won't cover you eyes 
 I want your innocence 
 Glisten before me in a cold sweat 
 I wan't you to see your lie spill on me 
 Spill on me 
 Manifested as a primitive craving 
 The craving never seems to go away 
 I want to see the face of everyone fall 
 Fall into the cold embrace of death 
 You're in my nightmare 
 I decide when it stops 
 It's my fucking drug 
 Makes my rush intensify 
 Hardcore the overdose 
 Your fear gets me high 
 Unbound I'm the weapon made to sterilize 
 Sterilize all the idiot victims 
 Anytime, anywhere, anyone I want 
 Everyone's addicted to this torture 
 I'm the agony in every breath 
 Every breath brings you closer to me 
 You'll do anything, anything 
 You'll do anything to make it stop

 Makes my rush intensify 
 Chaos deep inside it makes me 
 It makes me feel surreal 
 It makes me need to kill 
 It makes me feel surreal 
 It makes me need to kill 
 Do you want to feel eternity 
 Your eternity lies within me 
 I am the terror of your final breath 
 Your final breath brings light to my darkness

106,Slayer,metal,Flesh Storm,"Take a deep breath 
 'Cause it all starts now 
 When you pull the fuckin' pin 
 The shrapnel burns 
 As it tears into your skin 
 Ever wonder what it takes 
 To be questioning your faith 
 This is what it's like 
 When it happens every Goddamn day 
 Violence is a way of life 
 Shards of life 
 Like confetti in the air 
 The flesh storm grows 
 As it breeds despair 
 You hear the screams in the distance 
 Fighting the resistance 
 Not cries of war 
 These are just the sounds of pain 
 It's all just psychotic devotion 
 Manipulated with no discretion 
 (Lead - Hanneman) 
 Killing's in style 
 And it's now the main event 
 The cameras are whores 
 For the daily bloodshed 
 Like a junkie 
 Hungry for a fix of anything 
 The media devours 
 And feasts upon the inhumane 
 Violence is a way of life 
 It's all too fuckin' clear 
 We can never coincide 
 So let's all drink 
 To genocide 
 All the venomous sights 
 Border on the arcane 
 In times of war 
 Everything is bound by pain 
 It's all just psychotic devotion 
 Manipulated with no discretion 
 Warfare knows no compassion 
 Thrives with no evolution 
 Unstable minds exacerbate 
 Unrest in peace

 There's no future 
 The world is dead 
 So save that last 
 Bullet for your head 
 Only the fallen have won 
 Because the fallen can't run 
 My vision's not obscure 
 For war there is no cure 
 So hear the only law 
 Men killing men 
 For someone else's cause 
 It's all just psychotic devotion 
 Manipulated with no discretion 
 It's all just psychotic devotion 
 Manipulated with no discretion"

 Licking your wounds that won't fucking heal

 Something about you 
 Keeps you from letting go 
 Of lame obsessions 
 Built up inside you 
 Forget the guesswork 
 You're starting at the source 
 Gazing into my eyes

 'Cause this is my war 
 All day and every day

 To be covered in blood... blood from above 
 This violence ﬁnally sets me free 
 Brings demons back to torture me 
 There's no god pulling at my strings 
 I'm above all sorrow faith can bring 
 Disengaged I see your face 
 An adrenaline rush I can't replace 
 Hands around your neck your senses numb 
 Staring into your eyes when the stillness comes"
133,Slayer,metal,Chasing Death,"You can never truly see 
 Inside the ones you know 
 Until you've found them near 
 The edge of self control 
 All I hear are lies 
 You're lying to yourself 
 And everything is out of control 
 You're just a fuckin' slave of discontent 
 I'm sick of watching you dig this hole 
 Time waits - for no one 
 Won't stop - It can't be outrun 
 You know - That pain in your head 
 Won't stop till the desperation ends 
 You've found yourself chasing death 
 Oblivious until the end 
 You'll never stop chasing death 
 Innocence, common sense, I don't see the relevance 
 Of anything that you've got to say 
 Parasite, socialite, you're never gonna win this fight 
 There is no fucking easy way out 
 No easy way out 
 I know I should have seen it all coming 
 But I had to find it out on my own 
 A whore to incompetence you hide behind 
 The shadow that once was your thrown 
 Control is a discipline even when 
 Frustration just stands in your way 
 The throes of insanity feel just like 
 A war inside you everyday 
 I know I should have seen it all coming 
 But I had to find it out on my own 
 A whore to incompetence you hide behind 
 The shadow that once was your thrown 
 Control is a discipline even when 
 Frustration just stands in your way 
 The throes of insanity feel just like 
 A war inside you everyday 
 Time waits - for no one 
 Won't stop - It can't be outrun 
 There's just - no way of knowing 
 How long - paranoia's growing 
 Can't stop the poison winning 
 Please - Just take away this feeling 
 You know - that pain in your head 
 Won't stop until the desperation ends 
 You've found yourself chasing death 
 Oblivious until the end 
 You'll never stop until you're dead 
 Innocence, common sense, I don't see the relevance 
 Of anything that you've got to say 
 Parasite, socialite, you're never gonna win the fight 
 There is no fucking easy way out 
 No easy way out 
 No easy way out 
 No easy way out"
134,Slayer,metal,Implode,"So is it just me 
 Or everyone can see 
 The world drowning in its own blood 
 Humanity's decline 
 Dismantled over time 
 A fossil drying in the mud 
 It's deception and the greed 
 That germinates the seed 
 Of dissent growing all around 
 Is this the beginning or the end 
 In darkness we descend 
 And I can't wait to see it all go down 
 Standing room only all the world will attend 
 Front row center to the ultimate end 
 Mankind constantly parading its flaws 
 Tangled in charades of the orthodox laws 
 Like a firestorm raging out of control 
 Ignorance of all has taken its toll 
 It seems that blame is your personal hell 
 Dish it out to anyone but never yourself 
 Implode 
 No resurrection of divine 
 Implode 
 Extermination of the swine 
 Sick of this shit called policy 
 Life support for a dead economy 
 Brain dead leaders of the world conspire 
 Acting with malice only fuels the fire 
 No wonder people of religion obsess 
 All it wants a man to do is confess 
 Arrogance will never let the fools concede 
 You know you're gonna have to stand and watch them bleed 
 Implode 
 Cleansation of mankind 
 Implode 
 Extermination of the Swine 
 So many still ask why 
 I've said a million times 
 There's nothing godly looking over us 
 It's just the choice you make 
 I'll still inject the hate 
 That brings finality to the fuss 
 Society will bleed 
 So watch the violence breed 
 And deconstruct the protocol 
 And if I'm proven wrong 
 I think you know the song 
 I'm pretty sure that God still hates us all 
 Standing room only all the world will attend 
 Front row center to the ultimate end 
 Mankind constantly parading its flaws 
 Tangled in charades of the orthodox laws 
 No wonder people of religion obsess 
 All it wants a man to do is confess 
 Arrogance will never let the fools concede 
 You know you're gonna have to stand and watch them bleed 
 Implode 
 Cleansation of mankind 
 Implode 
 Extermination of the swine 
 No resurrection of divine 
 Extermination of the swine 
 It's the cleansation of mankind 
 No resurrection of divine 
 Extermination of mankind"
135,Slayer,metal,Piano Wire,"The traitor stand within the wolves' lair 
 Body count now imminent 
 The tension will rise, the air is on fire 
 This nightmare will not go on 
 Prophecy has touched my hand 
 The outcome starts here and now 
 Raise the flag as it burns 
 This nation's blood will not be lost 
 Take the war 
 Taste the blood 
 Attack and continue 
 Never surrender 
 We shall be victorious 
 Attack - continue - never 
 Never surrender 
 Your body will hang, piano wire plays 
 The music will relieve you 
 So delicate and lifeless now 
 Is innocence victorious? 
 Do you think I won't touch your grave? 
 Devotion to all insane 
 If war is lost you will die before I 
 Without dignity for all to see 
 Take the war 
 Taste the blood 
 Attack and continue 
 Never surrender 
 We shall be victorious 
 Attack - continue - never 
 Never surrender 
 The terror won't end without you my friend 
 This philosophy dreams of murder 
 Liquidated down painless face 
 Death has come no one to mourn 
 Who will scream when all are gone? 
 Not for love, for the enemy 
 Fanatical zeal will bring this to an end 
 Divine providence the world's end 
 Drink the war 
 Piano wire plays 
 Your body hangs 
 Piano wire plays 
 Take the war 
 Taste the blood 
 Attack and continue 
 Never surrender 
 We shall be victorious 
 Attack 
 Never surrender"
136,Slayer,metal,Atrocity Vendor,"You're staring at the atrocity vendor 
 A fuckin' equal opportunity offender 
 A sociopath with methodical control 
 Voyeur of terror watch the scenes of death unfold 
 I'll never hesitate to beat you, break you, sever every part of you 
 Light you up with kerosene, watch you burn, watch you bleed 
 I am torture redefined, cancer shooting from my eyes 
 Hell yes, agony is real, I can show you how it feels 
 Violence pulsing in my veins, death forever reigns 
 In this chapel I am the pastor 
 A fucking guarantee of your impending disaster 
 No limit to the anguish you'll see 
 Bear witness to this agony eternally 
 I'll never hesitate to beat you, break you, sever every part of you 
 Reeking of despair, this is no fuckin' nightmare 
 I am torture redefined, cancer shooting from my eyes 
 Hell yes, agony is real, I can show you how it feels 
 Violence pulsing in my veins, death forever reigns 
 You're staring at the atrocity vendor 
 Mother fuckin' equal opportunity offender 
 So many parts of you I'll possess 
 Trophies of appendage are mine to obsess 
 I'll never hesitate to beat you, break you, sever every part of you 
 First class terror ride, personal genocide 
 I am evil unconfined, cancer shooting from my eyes 
 Hell yes, agony is real, I can show you how it feels 
 Violence pulsing in my veins, death forever reigns 
 Original Version 
 You're staring at the atrocity vendor 
 A fucking equal opportunity offender 
 I've got the plan that's gonna change this world 
 Stand back and watch the seeds of hate unfold 
 I'll never hesitate to break you, rape you, sever every part of you 
 Light you up with kerosene, watch you burn, watch you bleed 
 I am torture unconfined, cancer shooting from my eyes 
 Hell yes, agony is real 
 I can show you how it feels 
 Violence pulse in my veins, death forever reigns 
 This is more than just my endless rapture 
 I'll fucking guarantee of your impending disaster 
 A socio-path with my thawable control 
 Aggregate of terror watch the seeds of death unfold 
 I'll never hesitate to break you, rape you, sever every part of you 
 Reeking of his breath, It's a new fucking nightmare 
 I am torture unconfined, cancer shooting from my eyes 
 Hell yes, agony is real, I can show you how it feels 
 Violence pulses in my veins, death forever reigns 
 You're staring at the atrocity vendor 
 A mother fucking equal opportunity offender 
 I'll introduce you to my own morbid charm 
 And fist fuck you with your own severed arms 
 I'll never hesitate to break you, rape you, torture every part of you 
 Crisscross, terrorize, personal genocide 
 I am evil unconfined, cancer shooting from my eyes 
 Hell yes, agony is real 
 I can show you how it feels 
 Violence pulses in my veins, death forever... death forever reigns."
137,Slayer,metal,You Against You,"I had your back, but it's no use 
 False accusations are on the loose 
 You know what? It makes no sense that you tied your own noose 
 You never felt the sores decay 
 Your perfect world is ending today 
 So what? I wouldn't have it any other way 
 Is this your paradise? You think you thought this through? 
 'Cause when you rolled the dice, the house came down on you 
 Don't care what you do or say, your suicide begins today 
 Have fun in paradise, this hell is just for you 
 You against you 
 Shitty time to make a stand all without a master plan, just you 
 You against you 
 So how's your paradise? Hindsight just laughs at you 
 With conflict comes a price, that price weighs heaviest on you 
 I guess I should say thanks, dissension in the ranks 
 Your panic lit the fuel, now it's you against you 
 You against you 
 Wasn't looking for a fight, but I'm showing up tonight 
 Shitty time to make a stand all without a master plan, just you 
 You against you 
 These seeds are what you've sown 
 Never should have lit that fuse 
 Enjoy your paradise 
 This hell is just for you 
 You against you 
 Wasn't looking for a fight, but I'm showing up tonight 
 Shitty time to make a stand all without a master plan, just you 
 You against you"
138,Slayer,metal,Pride In Prejudice,"You made your choice 
 I'll take my stand 
 Your life story in my blood stained hands 
 Pride in prejudice 
 Don't give me that power bullshit 
 Pride in prejudice 
 One gunshot sets the precedence 
 Abuse of power, civil unrest 
 Money in blood is of no significance 
 Inner rage waiting to ignite 
 Blood of the innocent unites 
 I'm right you're wrong 
 In number I'm strong 
 Violence is proof enough that I am 
 Pride in prejudice 
 Don't give me that power bullshit 
 Pride in prejudice 
 One gunshot sets the precedence 
 Martial law, a militant state 
 Barrel of a gun seals your fate 
 Fire burns with media hype 
 Speak the truth through your own lies 
 Pride in prejudice 
 Don't give me that power bullshit 
 Hate in violence 
 One gunshot sets the precedence 
 Pride in prejudice 
 Don't give me your bullshit 
 Pride in prejudice 
 One gunshot killed the innocent 
 Some love to hate 
 Right in your face 
 Violence will facilitate 
 Fuel the fire with racial slurs 
 And see who kills the other first"
139,Slayer,metal,Witching Hour,"Come hear the moon is calling, 
 The witching hour draws near, 
 Come hear the bell is tolling, 
 Mortals run in fear, 
 Prepare the altar now and hear the virgin cry, 
 Hold fast the sacrifice, 
 For now it's the time to die, 
 All hell breaks loose, 
 Hell's breaking loose. 
 Unveil the pentagram, 
 And feel the demons lust, 
 Come watch the holy men, 
 Who look on in disgust, 
 Come taste blood, 
 And feel the heat of Satan's breath, 
 Look in the sky's and see, 
 The warriors of death, 
 All hell breaks loose, 
 Hell's breaking loose, 
 Witching hour. 
 Our work is now complete, 
 The blood runs fast and free, 
 And Satan takes his bride, 
 And cry's of blasphemy, 
 All hell rejoices at the child, 
 That she will bear, 
 And satans only son, 
 Shall be the worlds despair, 
 All hell breaks loose, 
 Hell's breaking loose, 
 Witching hour."
140,Slayer,metal,Born To Be Wild,"Get your motor running 
 Head out on the highway 
 Looking for adventure 
 And whatever comes our way 
 Yeah, darling go make it happen 
 Leave the world in a dull disgrace 
 Fire all your guns and once in 
 Explode into space 
 I like smoke and lightning 
 Heavy metal thunder 
 Racing with the wind 
 And the feeling that I'm under 
 Yeah, darling go make it happen 
 Leave the world in a dull disgrace 
 Fire all your guns and once in 
 Explode into space 
 Like a true metal child 
 We were born, born to be wild 
 We can climb so high 
 I never want to die 
 Born to be wild 
 Born to be wild 
 Get your motor running 
 Head out on the highway 
 Looking for some danger 
 And take whatever comes our way 
 Yeah, darling go make it happen 
 Leave the world in a dull disgrace 
 Fire all your guns and once in 
 Explode into space 
 Like a true metal child 
 We were born, born to be wild 
 We can climb so high 
 I never want to die 
 Born to be wild

143,Slayer,metal,Human Disease,"Obsessive acts of hate, abductions and massacre 
 Breeding emotion subvergance, when the living become the dead 
 Home invasion, private party of thieves 
 Blood spilled, material thrill 
 A sign of the times 
 Self-destruction, a terminal mind 
 Sadomasochist a high profile, trained in apathy 
 Intellect repulsed, your torn, and death will have a face 
 Ravage passion, a theme for the 90's 
 Tormented devients, when fucking becomes psychotic 
 Domesticated rage, actions of desperation 
 A struggle of inner-killing, a sign of the times 
 Self-destruction, a terminal mind 
 Stranggled to death, little miss beauty queen 
 With a fractured head, so it seems 
 America's little royal miss, raped of innocence 
 Daddy's little girl to the end 
 Seduction and torture, sex of the 90's 
 Mass murders and random violence, when the living become the dead 
 Father killing mother, daughter, son suicide pact 
 Butchers black 24/7, a sign of the times 
 Self-destruction, self destruction 
 A Human Disease 
 Jealosy killed the queen 
 Sliced her neck from ear to ear 
 Money and power set the king free 
 A jury of his peers let him be 
 Jealosy killed the queen 
 Sliced her neck from ear to ear 
 Money and power set the king free 
 Shatter will in retribution 
 Life, watch it die, life ripped in half 
 Drastic pain a symphony, sceams 
 No escape your time to die 
 Hardened steel against your head, it weights 
 Self-destruct remain insane 
 (Repeat second verse) 
 Death will have your face"
144,Slayer,metal,Jeff Hanneman's Home Recordings 1,"Trapped in purgatory 
 A lifeless object, alive 
 Awaiting reprisal 
 Death will be their acquittence 
 The sky is turning red 
 Return to power draws near 
 Fall into me, the sky's crimson tears 
 Abolish the rules made of stone 
 Pierced from below, souls of my treacherous past 
 Betrayed by many, now ornaments dripping above 
 Awaiting the hour of reprisal 
 Your time slips away 
 Raining blood 
 From a lacerated sky 
 Bleeding its horror 
 Creating my structure 
 Now I shall reign in blood!"
145,Slayer,metal,Jeff Hanneman's Home Recordings 2,"An unforeseen future nestled somewhere in time. 
 Unsuspecting victims no warnings, no signs. 
 Judgment day the second coming arrives. 
 Before you see the light you must die. 
 Forgotten children, conform a new faith, 
 Avidity and lust controlled by hate. 
 [The] Never ending search for your shattered sanity, 
 Souls of Damnation in their own reality. 
 Chaos rampant, 
 An age of distrust. 
 Confrontations. 
 Impulsive habitat. 
 Bastard sons beget your cunting daughters, 
 Promiscuous mothers with your incestuous fathers. 
 Engreat souls condemned for all eternity, 
 Sustained by immoral observance a domineering deity. 
 Chaos rampant, 
 An age of distrust. 
 Confrontations. 
 Impulsive sabbath. 
 On and on, south of heaven 
 On and on, south of heaven 
 On and on, south of heaven 
 On and on, south of heaven 
 The root of all evil is the heart of a black soul. 
 A force that has lived all eternity. 
 A never ending search for a truth never told. 
 The loss of all hope and your dignity. 
 Chaos rampant, 
 An age of distrust. 
 Confrontations. 
 Impulsive habitat.

 On and on, south of heaven
