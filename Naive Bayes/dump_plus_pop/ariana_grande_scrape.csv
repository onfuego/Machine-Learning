26,Ariana Grande,pop,My Everything,"I cried enough tears to see my own reflection in them, 
 And then it was clear - I can't deny, I really miss him... 
 To think that I was wrong; 
 I guess you don't know what you got till it's gone... 
 Pain is just a consequence of love; 
 I'm saying sorry for the sake of us... 
 He wasn't my everything till we were nothing, and it's taken me a lot to say, 
 And now that he's gone, my heart is missing something, so it's time to push my pride away, 
 'Cause you are, you are, you are my everything... 
 You are, you are, you are my everything... 
 I know you're not far, but I still can't handle all the distance; 
 You're travelling with my heart - I hope this is a temporary feeling, 
 'Cause it's too much to bear 
 Without you, and I know sorry ain't the cure... 
 If I cross your mind, just know I'm yours, 
 'Cause what we got is worth fighting for, 'cause you are... 
 You weren't my everything till we were nothing, and it's taken me a lot to say; 
 Now that you're gone, my heart is missing something, so it's time I push my pride away... 
 You are, you are, you are my everything...

 I know all the competition after to you 
 So I get to thinking, is this too good to be true? 
 That we're living 
 In a fairytale, no malice and no lies 
 Baby oh, it's hard to believe 
 That the love you have inside you is only mine 
 That's how I know 
 I can't be your only one 
 No I, can't be your only one 
 Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met 
 And your love is three times better 
 How could anyone forget 
 No I can't 
 I can't be your only one 
 No I, can't be your only one 
 Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met

 How could anyone forget it, yeah 
 As I'm laying down, with you every night 
 It still gets to me that you remain by my side 
 I ain't saying that I'm not deserving of you 
 But I was dreaming bigger than I ever knew when 
 I wished for living 
 In a fairytale, no malice and no lies 
 Baby oh, it's hard to believe 
 That the love you have to give is only mine 
 That's how I know 
 I can't be your only one

 Before I make a move

 Got everyone watchin' us, so baby, let's keep it secret

 What you getting into when you get up? 
 When I wake up early, I'm gonna text ya

 I just want you to remember 
 How it was, how it is, how it could be 
 You could pull me in, you could push me 
 Or we can go for a ride, you the sky 
 Looking up, you a high 
 You ain't never gotta lie 
 'Cause it's more than just pussy 
 For the night, everything's alright 
 When you lay down, I'mma hit the lights

 Give you what you want, what you need

 I like the way you lick the bowl 
 Sometimes your method touches my soul 
 It lifts me up to heights unknown 
 So when they ask, ""How's life?"" I go (sheesh, sheesh) 
 When life deals us cards 
 Make everything taste like it is salt 
 Then you come through like the sweetener you are 
 Know how to bring the bitter taste to a halt

 Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it

 Had so much fun watching them unfold (watch them unfold) 
 You said she like me, I smiled, I know 
 So when they ask, ""How's life?"" I go (sheesh, sheesh)

 Kiss it, kiss it, kiss it 
 You make me say oh, oh (sheesh, sheesh) 
 And then we lay it back, talk the rest of the night 
 Things that we can light make me say oh, oh 
 Talking about what you wanna do, whatever's wrong or right 
 I am followin' you 'cause you make me say oh, oh 
 Say, I don't know what I'd do without you in my life, it'd be so sour 
 I'm hoping that everybody can experience what we have in ours 
 When life deals us cards 
 Make everything taste like it is salt

 If I don't have you, you, you, you, you 
 You see through right to the heart of me 
 You break down my walls with the strength of your love 
 I never knew love like I've known it with you 
 Will a memory survive, with what I can hold onto 
 I don't really need to look very much further 
 I don't wanna have to go where you don't follow 
 I won't hold it back again, this passion inside 
 I can't run from myself 
 There's nowhere to hide 
 Your love I'll remember forever 
 Don't make me close one more door 
 I don't wanna hurt anymore 
 Stay in my arms if you dare 
 Or must I imagine you there 
 Don't walk away from me 
 I have nothing, nothing, nothing 
 Don't make me close one more door 
 I don't wanna hurt anymore 
 Stay in my arms if you dare 
 Or must I imagine you there 
 Don't walk away from me, no 
 Don't walk away from me 
 Don't you dare walk away from me 
 I have nothing, nothing, nothing 
 If I don't have you, you 
 If I don't have you, oh, ooh, ooh"
75,Ariana Grande,pop,Just For Now,"Just for now 
 Just for now 
 Just for now 
 Just for now 
 Just for now 
 Just for now 
 How did you know? 
 It's what I always wanted 
 Could never have had too many of these 
 Would you, quit kicking me under the table 
 I'm trying; will somebody make her shut up about it? 
 Can we settle down please? 
 It's that time of year 
 I know we've all had a bumpy ride 
 I'm secretly on your side 
 Tears stop right here 
 I know we've all had a bumpy ride 
 I'm secretly on your side 
 Bite tongue 
 Deep breaths 
 Count to ten 
 Nod your head 
 I think something is burning 
 Now you've ruined the whole thing 
 Muffle the smoke alarm 
 Whoever put on this music? 
 Better quick sharp remove it 
 Pour me another 
 Oh, don't wag your finger at me 
 It's that time of year 
 Leave all our hopelessness's aside 
 If just for a little while 
 Tears stop right here 
 I know we've all had a bumpy ride 
 I'm secretly on your side 
 Get me out of here 
 Get me out of here 
 Get me out of here 
 (x4) 
 Get me out of here 
 Just for love 
 Just for love"
76,Ariana Grande,pop,O Holy Night,"Graham: 
 The stars are brightly shining 
 It is the night of the dear Savior's birth 
 Long lay the world in sin and error pining 
 Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth 
 A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices 
 For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn 
 Fall on your knees 
 Oh, hear the angel voices 
 O night divine 
 O night when Christ was born 
 O night divine 
 O night 
 O night divine 
 Ariana: 
 Led by the light of faith serenely beaming 
 With glowing hearts by His cradle I stand 
 So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming 
 Here come the wise men from the Orient land 
 The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger 
 In all our trials born to be our friend 
 Fall on my knees 
 Oh, hear the angel voices 
 O night divine 
 O night when Christ was born 
 O night divine 
 O night 
 O night divine 
 Both: 
 Fall on your knees // Fall on my knees 
 Both: 
 Oh hear the angel voices 
 O night divine 
 O night when Christ was born 
 O night divine 
 O night 
 O night divine"
77,Ariana Grande,pop,Private Party,"I'm having a private party 
 Ain't no body here but me, my angels, and my guitar singin' 
 Baby look how far we've come here 
 I'm havin' a private party 
 I'm learning how to love me 
 Celebrating the woman I've become, yeah 
 I tried to call my mother, but 
 She didn't get where I was going 
 I called my boyfriend and he said 
 Call me back a little later baby 
 I hung up the phone, I felt so alone 
 Started to feel a little pity 
 That's when I realized that I 
 Gotta find the joy inside of me 
 I'm having a private party 
 Ain't no body here but me, my angels, and my guitar singin' 
 Baby look how far we've come here 
 I'm havin' a private party 
 I'm learning how to love me 
 Celebrating the woman I've become, yeah 
 I wanna take off all my clothes 
 Look at myself in the mirror 
 We're gonna have a conversation 
 We're gonna heal the disconnection 
 I don't remember when it started 
 But this is where it's gonna end 
 My body is beautiful and sacred 
 And I'm gonna celebrate it 
 I'm having a private party 
 Ain't no body here but me, my angels, and my guitar singin' 
 Baby look how far we've come here 
 I'm havin' a private party 
 I'm learning how to love me 
 Celebrating the woman I've become, yeah 
 All my life 
 I've been looking for 
 Somebody else 
 To make me whole 
 But I had to learn the hard way 
 True love began with me 
 This is not ego or vanity 
 I'm just celebrating me 
 I'm having a private party 
 Ain't no body here but me, my angels, and my guitar singin' 
 Baby look how far we've come here 
 I'm havin' a private party 
 I'm learning how to love me 
 Celebrating the woman I've become, yeah"

 He don't give me orders 
 He don't condescend 
 Suddenly Frankie is here to provide me 
 Sweet understanding

 Tell me the bad times are clean washed away

 For losers like I've been it's so hard to say
