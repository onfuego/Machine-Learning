 Your words give birth like rosemary 
 You know you don't want to bury more friends

 I grew up overnight 
 I played alone, I played on my own 
 I survived 
 Hey, I wanted everything I never had 
 Like the love that comes with light 
 I wore envy and I hated that 
 But I survived 
 I had a one-way ticket to a place where all the demons go 
 Where the wind don't change and nothing in the ground can ever grow 
 No hope, just lies and you're taught to cry into your pillow 
 But I survived 
 I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing 
 I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing 
 I'm alive 
 I'm alive 
 I'm alive 
 I'm alive 
 I found solace in the strangest place 
 Way in the back of my mind 
 I saw my life in a stranger's face 
 And it was mine 
 I had a one-way ticket to a place where all the demons go 
 Where the wind don't change and nothing in the ground can ever grow 
 No hope, just lies, and you're taught to cry into your pillow

 You took it out, but I'm still breathing 
 I have made every single mistake 
 That you could ever possibly make 
 I took and I took and I took what you gave 
 But you never noticed that I was in pain 
 I knew what I wanted, I went in and got it 
 Did all the things that you said that I wouldn't 
 I told you that I would never be forgotten 
 And all in spite of you 
 And I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing 
 I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing 
 I'm alive (You took it all, but I'm still breathing)

97,SIA,pop,Confetti,"We had love so strong my heart couldn't take it 
 You took it in your hands and resuscitated 
 You said, me and you against the world 
 You said, you and me forever girl 
 I felt every cell fall in love with you but 
 I watched you slip, slip away, no explanation 
 You on your phone, your laptop and your PlayStation 
 I stared at the diamond on my finger and I waited 
 But the truth never came, but I know her name, so see you later 
 No I won't miss you, I won't cry, I don't regret it 
 No I won't stand for it, no I don't need confetti 
 And you can treat another to your lies, you'll never get it 
 I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti 
 I'd rather walk alone, I'd rather walk alone 
 I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti 
 You hurt my pride, part of me died, but all of that's ego 
 And the house we lived in had no doors, and it had no windows 
 You said, ""I'm hangin' with the boys"", you said ""Workin' late to pay our bills"" 
 But I found lipstick on your collar, wasn't my color 
 I watched you slip, slip away, no explanation 
 You on your phone, your laptop and your PlayStation 
 I stared at the diamond on my finger and I waited 
 But the truth never came, but I know her name, so see you later 
 No I won't miss you, I won't cry, I don't regret it 
 No I won't stand for it, no I don't need confetti

 I'm in here bawling, just a friend 
 Never thought we'd meet again

 Will the weight of life lift me? 
 Hear the chatter fooling me 
 Drown your voice with mighty weed

 For one so lonely 
 Faith creeps slowly over me 
 How Jesus wept 
 He wept as he 
 Took twelve steps 
 And carried me 
 Oh, how he wept 
 For thee 
 Resurrection on me 
 And I felt something light 
 A fear to abide by 
 I don't wanna fight 
 A blinding white light 
 And I heard a cry 
 And it was mine 
 Burning to survive 
 How Jesus wept 
 He wept as he 
 Took twelve steps 
 And carried me 
 Oh, how he wept

 How Jesus wept 
 He wept as he 
 Took twelve steps 
 And carried me, yeah
