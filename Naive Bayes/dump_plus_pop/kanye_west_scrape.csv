0,Kanye West,hiphop,Intro (The College Dropout),"Kanye, can I talk to you for a minute? 
 Me and the other faculty members was wonderin', could you do a little som', somethin' beautiful? 
 Somethin' that the kids is gon' love when they hear it 
 That's gon' make them start jumpin' up and down and sharin' candy and stuff 
 Think you could probably do somethin' for the kids for graduation to sing?"
1,Kanye West,hiphop,We Don't Care,"Oh yeah, I've got the perfect song for the kids to sing 
 And all my people that's 
 Drug dealin' just to get by 
 Stack ya' money till it get sky high 
 We wasn't s'posed to make it past twenty-five 
 Joke's on you, we still alive 
 Throw your hands up in the sky and say 
 ""We don't care what people say"" 
 If this is your first time hearin' this 
 You are about to experience somethin' so cold, man 
 We never had nothin' handed, took nothin' for granted 
 Took nothin' from no man, man, I'm my own man 
 But as a shorty I looked up to the dopeman 
 Only adult man I knew that wasn't broke, man 
 Flickin' Starter coats, man 
 Man, you don't know, man 
 We don't care what people say 
 This is for my niggas outside all winter 
 'Cause this summer they ain't finna say, ""Next summer I'm finna"" 
 Sittin' in the hood like community colleges 
 This dope money here is little Trey's scholarship 
 'Cause ain't no tuition for having no ambition 
 And ain't no loans for sittin' your ass at home 
 So we forced to sell crack, rap, and get a job 
 You gotta do somethin' man, your ass is grown 
 Drug dealin' just to get by 
 Stack ya' money till it get sky high 
 Kids, sing, kids, sing 
 We wasn't s'posed to make it past twenty-five 
 Joke's on you, we still alive 
 Throw your hands up in the sky and say 
 ""We don't care what people say"" 
 The second verse is for my dogs workin' nine to five that still hustle 
 'Cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55 
 And everybody sellin' makeup, Jacob's and bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up 
 We put shit on layaway, then come back 
 We claim other people kids on our income tax 
 We take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid 
 And we don't care what people say 
 Mama say she wanna move south 
 Scratchin' lottery tickets, eyes on a new house 
 'Round the same time, Doe ran up in dude house 
 Couldn't get a job, so since he couldn't get work, he figured he'd take work 
 The drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight 
 A nigga's money is homo, it's hard to get straight 
 But we gon' keep bakin' till the day we get cake 
 And we don't care what people say, my niggas 
 Drug dealin' just to get by 
 Stack ya' money till it get sky high 
 Kids, sing, kids, sing 
 We wasn't s'posed to make it past twenty-five 
 Joke's on you, we still alive 
 Throw your hands up in the sky and say 
 ""We don't care what people say"" 
 You know the kids gon' act a fool 
 When you stop the programs for after-school 
 And they DCFS, some of 'em dyslexic 
 They favorite 50 Cent song ""12 Questions"" 
 We scream, ""Rocks, blow, weed, park,"" see, now we smart 
 We ain't retards, the way teachers thought 
 Hold up, hold fast, we make more cash 
 Now tell my mama I belong in that slow class 
 Sad enough we on welfare 
 They tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair 
 I'm tryna get the car with the chromie wheels here 
 They tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here 
 Look what was handed us, fathers abandoned us 
 When we get them hammers, go on, call the ambulance 
 Sometimes I feel no one in this world understands us 
 But we don't care what people say, my niggas 
 Drug dealin' just to get by 
 Stack ya' money till it get sky high 
 Kids, sing, kids, sing 
 We wasn't s'posed to make it past twenty-five 
 Joke's on you, we still alive 
 Throw your hands up in the sky and say 
 ""We don't care what people say"""
2,Kanye West,hiphop,Graduation Day,"What in the fuck was that Kanye? I told you to do some shit for the kids. 
 You give me your muthafuckin' graduation ticket right now. 
 You can give me this muthafuckin' robe 
 You will not walk across that stage, you won't slide across that stage 
 A muthafucker can't pull you across that muthafuckin' stage Kanye 
 Who told you see, I told you to do something uplifting 
 I'm tryin' to get you out here with these white people and this how you gone do me 
 You know what, you's a nigga 
 And I don't mean that in no nice way 
 Had little kids singin' about the shit, the joke's on you 
 You can throw your muthafuckin' hands in the air, and wave good-bye to every-fuckin'-body 
 Cause you getting the fuck out of this campus 
 Fucker what you gone do now 
 I'm no longer confused but don't tell anybody. 
 I'm about to break the rules but don't tell anybody. 
 I got something better than school but don't tell anybody. 
 My daddy would kill me so don't tell anybody. 
 He wants me to get a good ass job just like everybody. 
 He ain't walked in my shoes, I'm just not everybody."
3,Kanye West,hiphop,All Falls Down,"Syleena Johnson and Kanye West: 
 Oh when it all, it all falls down (Yeah, this the real one baby) 
 I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down (Chi-Town stand up) 
 Oh when it all, it all falls down (Southside, southside, we gon' set this party off right) 
 I'm telling you all, it all falls down (Westside, westside, we 'gon set this party off right) 
 Oh when it all 
 Kanye West: 
 Man I promise, she's so self-conscious 
 She has no idea what she's doing in college 
 That major that she majored in don't make no money 
 But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny 
 Now, tell me that ain't insecure 
 The concept of school seems so secure 
 Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a career 
 She like, ""Fuck it, I'll just stay down here and do hair"" 
 'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs 
 'Cause her baby-daddy don't really care 
 She's so precious with the peer pressure 
 Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexis 
 She had hair so long that it looked like weave 
 Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve 
 And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe 
 Single black female addicted to retail and well 
 Syleena Johnson and Kanye West: 
 Oh when it all, it all falls down 
 (And when it all falls down who you gonna call now?) 
 I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down (C'mon, c'mon) 
 (And when it falls down) Oh when it all 
 Kanye West: 
 Man I promise, I'm so self-conscious 
 That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches 
 Rollies and Pasha's done drove me crazy 
 I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that ver-say-see 
 Then I spent four-hundred bucks on this 
 Just to be like, ""Nigga you ain't up on this"" 
 And I can't even go to the grocery store 
 Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team 
 It seems we living the American dream 
 But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem 
 The prettiest people do the ugliest things 
 For the road to riches and diamond rings 
 We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us 
 We trying to buy back our forty acres 
 And for that paper, look how low we a stoop 
 Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe 
 Syleena Johnson and Kanye West: 
 Oh when it all, it all falls down (C'mon, c'mon) 
 (And when it falls down who you gonna call now?) 
 I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down (C'mon, c'mon) 
 (And when it falls down) Oh when it all 
 Kanye West: 
 I say fuck the police, that's how I treat 'em 
 We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom 
 We-a buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em 
 Things we buy to cover up what's inside 
 'Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth 
 That's why shorties holler, ""Where the ballers at?"" 
 Drug dealer buy Jordans, crackhead buy crack 
 And a white man get paid off of all of that 
 But I ain't even gonna act holier than thou 
 'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with twenty-five thou 
 Before I had a house and I'd do it again 
 'Cause I want to be on 106 and Park pushin' a Benz 
 I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific 
 I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific 
 I got a problem with spendin' before I get it 
 We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it 
 Syleena Johnson and Kanye West: 
 Oh when it all, it all falls down (Yeah, c'mon, c'mon) 
 (And when it all falls down who you gonna call now?) 
 I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down (C'mon, c'mon 
 (And when it falls down) 
 Oh when it all, it all falls down (Southside, southside, we gon' set this party off right) 
 I'm telling you all, it all falls down (Westside, westside, we gon' set this party off right) 
 Oh when it all, it all falls down (Chi-Town, Chi-Town, we gon' show 'em how we get down) 
 I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down (Now Syleena, you just like a safe belt, you saved my life) 
 Oh when it all, it all falls down 
 I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down 
 DeRay Davis: 
 I's can't keep working like this 
 This grave shift is like a slave shift"
4,Kanye West,hiphop,I'll Fly Away,"Tony Williams and DeRay Davis: 
 One glad morning 
 When this life is over 
 I'll fly away 
 To a land where 
 Joy shall never end 
 I'll fly away 
 Oh I'll fly away, oh glory 
 I'll fly away 
 When I die hallelujah bye and bye 
 I'll fly away"
5,Kanye West,hiphop,Spaceship,"Kanye West, Marvin Gaye, and GLC: 
 I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit (Yeah, yeah) 
 I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly (Heavens knows) (Me too, I swear I do) 
 Past the sky (Every night, every night) (Yes, I feel you Ye, I feel you) 
 I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit 
 I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly (Heavens knows) 
 Past the sky (Every night, every night) 
 Kanye West: 
 Man, man, man 
 If my manager insults me again, I will be assaulting him 
 After I fuck the manager up then I'm gonna shorten the register up 
 Let's go back, back to the Gap, look at my check, wasn't no scratch 
 So if I stole, wasn't my fault, yeah I stole, never got caught 
 They take me to the back and pat me askin' me about some khakis 
 But let some black people walk in, I bet you they show off their token blackie 
 Oh now they love Kanye, let's put him all in the front of the store 
 So I'm on break next to the ""No Smokin'"" sign with a blunt in the mall 
 Takin' my hits, writing my hits, writin' my rhymes, playin' my mind 
 This fuckin' job can't help him so I quit, y'all welcome 
 Y'all don't know my struggle, y'all can't match my hustle 
 You can't catch my hustle, you can't fathom my love 
 Dude, lock yourself in a room doing five beats a day for three summers 
 That's a Different World like Cree Summer's, I deserve to do these numbers 
 ""The kid that made that deserves that Maybach"" 
 So many records in my basement, I'm just waiting on my spaceship, wow 
 Kanye West, Tony Williams, and Marvin Gaye: 
 I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit 
 I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly (Heavens knows) 
 Past the sky (Every night, every night) 
 I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit 
 I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly (Heavens knows) 
 Past the sky (Every night, every night) 
 GLC: 
 And I didn't even try to work a job, represent the mob at the same time 
 Thirsty on the grind, Chi state of mind, lost my momma, lost my mind 
 My life, my love, that's not mine, ""Why you ain't signed?"" Wasn't my time 
 Leave me alone, work for y'all, half of it's yours, half of it's mine 
 Only one to ball, never one to fall, got to get mine, got to take mine 
 Got a Tec-9, reach my prime, got to make these haters respect mine 
 In the mall until twelve when my schedule had said nine 
 Putting them pants on shelves waiting patiently I ask myself 
 Where I want to go, where I want to be 
 Life is much more than running in the streets 
 Holla at Ye, hit me with the beat 
 Put me on my feet, sound so sweet 
 Yes I'm the same ol' G, same goatee, staying low key, nope 
 Holler at God, ""Man why'd you have to take my folks?"" 
 Hope to see Freddie G., Yusef G, love my G 
 Rolly G., police watch me smoke my weed, count my G's 
 Got a lot of people counting on me and I'm just trying to find my peace 
 Should've finished school like my niece then I finally wouldn't use my piece, blow 
 Aw man, this pressure 
 Kanye West, Tony Williams, and Marvin Gaye: 
 I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit 
 I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly (Heavens knows) 
 Past the sky (Every night, every night) 
 I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit 
 I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly (Heavens knows) 
 Past the sky (Every night, every night) 
 Consequence: 
 Man, you know you gon' do it 
 I remember having to take the dollar cab, coming home real late at night 
 Standing on my feet all damn day trying to make this thing right 
 And having one of my co-workers say ""Yo, you look just like 
 This kid I seen in an old Busta Rhymes video the other night"" 
 Well easy come, easy go, how that saying goes 
 No more broad service, cars, and them TV shows 
 I had all that snatched from me, A&Rs and they faculties 
 All turn their back on me and didn't want to hear a rap from me 
 So naturally actually had to face things factually 
 Had to be a catastrophe with the fridges staring back at me 
 'Cause nothing's there, nothing's fair 
 I don't want to ever go back there 
 So I won't be taking no days off till my spaceship takes off 
 Kanye West, Tony Williams, and Marvin Gaye: 
 I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit 
 I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly (Heavens knows) 
 Past the sky (Every night, every night) 
 I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit 
 I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly (Heavens knows) 
 Past the sky (Every night, every night) 
 Tony Williams: 
 I want to fly, I want to fly 
 I said I want my chariot to pick me up and take me, brother, for a ride 
 Heaven knows, heaven knows"
6,Kanye West,hiphop,Jesus Walks,"Yo 
 We at war 
 We at war with terrorism, racism 
 And most of all, we at war with ourselves 
 (Jesus walk) God show me the way because the devil's tryna break me down 
 (Jesus walk with me, with me, with me, with me, with me) Yeah, uh 
 Kanye West and Curtis Mayfield: 
 You know what the Midwest is? Young and restless 
 Where restless (niggas) might snatch your necklace 
 And next these (niggas) might jack your Lexus 
 Somebody tell these (niggas) who Kanye West is 
 I walk through the valley of the Chi where death is 
 Top floor the view alone will leave you breathless 
 Try to catch it, it's kinda hard getting choked by detectives, yeah, yeah, now check the method 
 They be askin' us questions, harass and arrest us 
 Sayin' ""We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast"" 
 Huh? Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis? 
 We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases 
 A trunk full of coke, rental car from Avis 
 My mama used to say only Jesus can save us 
 Well mama I know I act a fool 
 But I'll be gone till November, I got packs to move, I hope 
 Kanye West: 
 (Jesus walks) God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down 
 (Jesus walk with me) The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now 
 (Jesus walk) And I don't think there's nothing I can do to right my wrong 
 (Jesus walk with me) I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long 
 (I want Jesus) 
 (Jesus walks) God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down

 (Jesus walk) And I don't think there's nothing I can do to right my wrong 
 (Jesus walk with me) I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long 
 (I want Jesus) 
 Kanye West and John Legend: 
 Uh, to the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers, even the scrippers (Jesus walks for them) 
 To the victims of welfare for we livin' in Hell here, hell yeah (Jesus walks for them) 
 Now, hear ye, hear ye, want to see thee more clearly 
 I know he hear me when my feet get weary 
 'Cause we're the almost nearly extinct 
 We rappers is role models, we rap, we don't think 
 I ain't here to argue about his facial features 
 Or here to convert atheists into believers 
 I'm just tryna say the way school need teachers 
 The way Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's the way I need Jesus 
 So here go my single dog, radio needs this 
 They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus 
 That means guns, sex, lies, videotape 
 But if I talk about God my record won't get played, huh? 
 Well if this take away from my spins 
 Which'll probably take away from my ends 
 Then I hope this take away from my sins 
 And bring the day that I'm dreamin' about 
 Next time I'm in the club, everybody screamin' out 
 Kanye West: 
 (Jesus walk) God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down

7,Kanye West,hiphop,Never Let Me Down,"Jay-Z: 
 Oh baby 
 Hahahahaha, turn it up for me 
 Jay-Z, Kanye West, and Michael Bolton: 
 When it comes to being true, at least true to me (That's right, it's what I do, c'mon) 
 One thing I found (Uh-huh), one thing I found 
 Oh no you'll never let me down (No I never let you down) 
 Get up I get (Down), get up I get (Down) 
 Get up I get (Down), get up I get (Down) 
 Get up I get (Down), get up I get (Down) 
 Jay-Z: 
 Yo, first I snatched the streets then I snatched the charts 
 First I had they ear, now I have their heart 
 Rappers came and went, I've been here from the start 
 I seen them put it together, watched them take it apart 
 Seen the rovers roll up with ribbons 
 I seen them re-po'd, re-sold, then re-driven 
 So when I reload, he holds number one position, when you hot, I'm hot 
 And when your feet cold, mines is sizzling 
 It's plain to see, niggas can't fuck with me 
 'Cause I'm a be that nigga for life 
 This is not an image, this is God given 
 This is hard livin', mixed with Cristal sippin' 
 It's the most consistent, Hov 
 Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and 
 Nigga I'm home on these charts, y'all niggas visitin' 
 It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordon of rap 
 I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy 
 Jay-Z, Kanye West, and Michael Bolton: 
 Get up I get (Down), get up I get (Down) 
 Get up I get (Down), get up I get 
 Kanye West: 
 Down for my grandfather who took my mama 
 Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat 
 At the tender age of six she was arrested for the sit-ins 
 And with that in my blood I was born to be different 
 Now niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadership 
 But we can make it to Jacob's and to the dealership 
 Swear I hear new music and I just don't be feelin' it 
 Racism's still alive, they just be concealin' it 
 But I know they don't want me in the damn club 
 They even made me show ID to get inside of Sam's Club 
 I done did dirt and went to church and get my hands scrubbed 
 Swear I've been baptized least three or four times 
 But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid 
 It's gonna take a lot more than coupons to get us saved 
 Like it take a lot more than doo rags to get you waves 
 Nothing sad as that day my girl's father passed away 
 So I promised to Mr. Rainey I'm gonna marry your daughter 
 And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up 
 And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her 
 You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up 
 But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye 
 'Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye 
 First Aaliyah now Romeo must die 
 I know I got angels watching me from the other side 
 Jay-Z, Kanye West, and Michael Bolton: 
 When it comes to being true, at least true to me 
 One thing I found, one thing I found 
 Oh no you'll never let me down 
 Get up I get (Down), get up I get (Down) 
 Get up I get (Down), get up I get (Down) 
 Get up I get (Down), get up I get (Down) 
 J. Ivy and Kanye West: 
 We are all here for a reason on a particular path 
 You don't need a curriculum to know that you are a part of the math 
 Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious 
 That's why I expose my soul to the globe; the world 
 I'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls 
 I'm not just another individual 
 My spirit is a part of this that's why I get spiritual 
 But I get my hymns from Him 
 So it's not me, it's He that's lyrical 
 I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven sent instrument 
 My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes 
 For your soul and your mental 
 That's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into 
 Yeah I need my loot by rent day 
 But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte 
 I'm trying to get us ""us free"" like Cinque 
 I can't stop, that's why I'm hot 
 Determination, dedication, motivation 
 I'm talking to you of my many inspirations 
 When I say I can't let you or self down 
 If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff 
 And if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life 
 In my grip I would never ever let you down 
 And when these words are found 
 Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed 
 With a language called love 
 That's why my breath is felt by the deaf 
 And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind 
 I too dream in color and in rhyme 
 So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house 
 'Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth 
 A touch of God reigns out (Take'em to the church) 
 Jay-Z, Kanye West, and Michael Bolton: 
 When it comes to being true, at least true to me 
 One thing I found, one thing I found 
 Oh no you'll never let me down 
 Get up I get, get up I get 
 Get up I get, get up I get 
 Get up I get, get up I get (down) 
 Jay-Z and Kanye West: 
 Who else you know been hot this long (Oh yeah, we ain't finished) 
 Started from nothing but he got this strong (The Roc is in the building) 
 Built the ROC from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you 
 Peddled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special (Woo) 
 Let you tell it man I'm falling, well somebody must have caught him 
 Every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan them 
 Number one albums what I got, like four of them 
 More of them on the way, the eighth wonder on the way 
 Clear the way, I'm here to stay 
 Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that 
 This is Jay, dissing Jay will get you maced 
 When I start spitting them lyrics niggas get very religious 
 Six Hail Mary's please Father forgive us 
 Young, the archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas 
 They way y'all all follow Jigga 
 Hov's a living legend and I'll tell you why 
 Everybody wanna be Hov and Hov's still alive 
 Michael Bolton: 
 Down, down 
 Down, down 
 Down, down"

 N-n-n-now, my flow is in the pocket like wallets, I got the bounce like hydraulics 
 I can't call it, I got the swerve like alcoholics 
 My freshman year I was going through hella problems 
 Till I built up the nerve to drop my ass up out of college 
 My teacher said I's a loser, I told her, ""Why don't you kill me?"" 
 I give a fuck if you fail me, I'm gonna follow 
 My heart, and if you follow the charts or the plaques or the stacks 
 You ain't gotta guess who's back, you see 
 I'm so shy that you thought I was bashful 
 But this bastard's flow will bash your skull 
 And I will, cut your girl like Pastor Tro' 
 And I don't, usually smoke but pass the 'dro 
 And I won't, give you that money that you asking for 
 Why you think me and Dame cool? We assholes 
 That's why we hear your music in fast forward 
 'Cause we don't wanna hear that weak shit no mo'

 Kanye West and Sumeke Rainey: 
 N-n-n-n-n-now who the hell is this, e-mailing me at 11:26? 
 Telling me that she 36-26, plus double-d 
 You know how girls on Black Planet be when they get bubbly 
 At NYU but she hail from Kansas 
 Right now she just lamping, chilling on campus 
 Sent me a picture of her feelin' on Candice 
 Who said her favorite rapper was the late great Francis 
 W-H-I-T-E, it's getting late mami 
 Your screen saver say tweet, so you got to call me 
 And bring a friend for my friend, his name Kweli 
 (You mean Talib? Lyrics sticks to your rib) 
 I mean, (That's my favorite CD that I play at my crib) 
 I mean, (You don't really know him, why is you lyin'?) 
 Yo Kwe, she don't believe me, please pick up the line 
 She gon' think that I'm lyin', just spit a couple of lines 
 Then maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time and get her high 
 Talib Kweli and Common: 
 Yeah, I can't believe this nigga use my name for picking up dimes 
 But never mind, I need some tracks, you tryin' to pull tracks out 
 And my rhymes is finna blow, you trying to blow backs out 
 Well okay, you twisted my arm, I'll assist with the charm 
 Ayo, ain't you meet that chick at that conference with your moms? 
 And sister's the bomb, boy she got the bougie behavior 
 Always got something to say like a okay playa hater, yeah 
 Anyway, I don't usually fuck with the Internet 
 Or chicks with birth control stuck to they arm like Nicorette 
 You really fuckin' that much or trying to get off cigarettes? 
 If she think it's fly, she ain't met a real nigga yet 
 Now I apologize if I come off a little inconsiderate 
 I got the bubba kush and a sister could get a hit of it (Yo, yo) 
 Common: 
 Get 'em high like noon or the moon 
 Or a room filled with smoke, a hype filled with dope 
 Y'all assumed I was doomed, out of tune 
 But I still filled the notes with real nigga quotes 
 Real rappers is hard to find, like a remote 
 Control rap is out of 
 Used to, but still got love 
 That's why I abuse you who are not thugs, rock clubs like Tiger 
 Woods in the hood, to have my own reality show, called Soul Survivor 
 I stole on liver, niggas than you 
 You's a bitch I got ones that are thicker than you 
 How could I ever let your words affect me? 
 They say hip hop is dead, I'm here to resurrect me 
 Marsha's too sexy to even make songs like these 
 That's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys 
 Too many featured emcees, and producers is popular 
 Twelve thousand spins, nobody got to coppin' a 
 Album, how come? You the hot garbage of 
 The year's clear your image and snooped up 
 Label got you souped up, tellin' you you sick 
 When you a dick with a loose nut 
 Video hard to watch like Medusa 
 Even your club record need a booster 
 Chimped up, with a pimp cup, illiterate nigga 
 Read the infra-red across your head, I'm bred king like Simba 
 Bolder than Denver, I ain't a Madd Rapper, just an emcee with a temper 
 You dancing for money like Honey, I did this my way 
 So when the industry crash, I survive like Kanye 
 Spittin' through wires and fires, emcees retirin' 
 Got your hands up, get them motherfuckers higher then 
 Kanye West: 
 N-now, th-th-throw your motherfuckin' hands, get 'em high (Yeah) 
 All the girls pass the weed to your motherfuckin' man, get 'em high 
 Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands, keep 'em high 
 And if you're losin' your high then smoke again, keep 'em high"

 Breathe in, breathe out 
 Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out 
 If a nigga act up, pull a Desert Eag' out 
 When I pull the piece out niggas like ""Peace out!"" 
 (Verse 1: Kanye West) 
 Golly, more of that bullshit ice rap 
 I got to 'pologize to Mos and Kweli (probably) 
 But is it cool to rap about gold 
 If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali? (Mali!) 
 First nigga with a Benz and a backpack 
 Ice chain, Cardi lens, and a knapsack 
 Always said if I rapped I'd say somethin' significant 
 But now I'm rappin' 'bout money, hoes, and rims again 
 And it's still about the Benjamins 
 Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms 
 Strippers named Cinnamon 
 More chips than Pentium 
 What'cha gon' buy next? Whatever new trend it is 
 I'm tryin' to spend my stacks 
 And I'm so broke I look back like ""Damn, was I on crack?"" 
 I mean twelve platinum chains, was I on that? 
 What the hell was wrong with me dog? 
 Sing along with my y'all

 Now even though I went to college and dropped out of school quick 
 I always had a Ph.D.: a Pretty Huge Dick 
 Ladies tired of gettin' ripped off by guys like this 
 And givin' head is like 'oh well, the shoes and the toothpick' 
 Well, I'm in the club for a limited time 
 Act now and get some action for free-99 
 Later on I might charge for ménage 
 Heard her man was the boss of the floss 
 But she still want to toss me the drawers 
 And it ain't gon' cost me because she my caddy 
 'Cause she grabbed my golf balls in the club 
 And I'm still actin' calm than a mug 
 She asked ""Can you drive me and the hunnies to where my Altima was?"" 
 While we drive she tellin' me 'bout problems with her man 
 Baby I fully understand 
 Let me help you with a plan 
 While he trickin' off, don't get no rich nigga 
 Give ME some head, that'll really piss him off

 I blow past low class niggas with no cash 
 In the fo' dash six, bitch you can go ask 
 So when I go fast popo just laugh 
 Right until I run out of gas or till I go crash 
 Whatever comes first I'm prepared for the worst 
 Whatever comes second I'll be there with my weapon 
 Pullin' up in the Lexuses, one on both hand 
 So I guess them GSes was ambidextrous 
 Coulda sworn her breasteses was sendin' me messages 
 ""K I need a free hand mammogram 
 I got weed, drink, and a Handicam 
 All of which is legal in Amsterdam"" 
 So say my name like Candyman 
 And I'ma come and fix you up like the handyman 
 But if you don't need a fix, girl you gotta leave 
 You can't take that all at one time ya gotta breathe

 But it'll be your money. 
 No more borrowing from mom for my high 
 So now you get your degree tattooed on your back you're so excited about it 
 If you continue to work at the Gap 
 After several interviews 
 Oh My God, you'll come in at an entry level position 
 And when you do that, if you kiss enough ass 
 You'll move up to the next level, 
 Which is bein' a secretary's secretary! 
 And boy is that great. 
 You get to take messages for the secretary who never went to college 
 She's actually the boss's niece! 
 So now you're part of the family 
 You know what college does for you? 
 It makes you really smart man. 
 All you kids wanted talk in the back of the class? 
 Not me, I listened, OK 
 I was a hall-monitor. 
 It was meant to be. 
 You know how many classes I took? 
 Extra classes, extra classes 
 No I've never had sex! 
 But ya know what?

 All the other kids' parents were working and saving up money for school 
 And I was actually in school all while my dad was in school! 
 He was so greedy with degrees, he took my degree

 These are documented, my father left them to me

 Now all I know I know all these things (real is what you live to be) 
 This is family business 
 And this is for everybody standin' with us 
 Come on, let's take a family Grammy picture 
 Abby, remember when they ain't believe in me? 
 Now she like, ""See, that's my cousin on TV"" 
 Now, we gettin' it and we gon' make it 
 And y'all gon' hate it and I'm his favorite 
 I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider 
 But when we get together be electric slidin' 
 Grandma, get 'em shook up 
 Aw naw, don't open the photo book up 
 I got an Aunt Ruth that can't remember your name 
 But I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane 
 You know that one auntie, you don't mean to be rude 
 But every holiday nobody eatin' her food 
 And you don't wanna stay there 'cause them your worst cousins 
 Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins 
 Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousins 
 Fit three in the bed while six of y'all 
 I'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg 
 But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed 
 Rain, rain, rain go away 
 Let the sun come out and all the children say 
 Rain, rain, rain go away 
 Let the sun come out and all the children say 
 I woke up early this mornin' with a new state of mind 
 A creative way to rhyme without usin' knives and guns 
 Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God 
 And keep your face to the risin' sun 
 All my niggas from the Chi, that's my family dog 
 And my niggas ain't my guys, they my family dog 
 I feel like one day you'll understand me dog 
 You can still love your man and be manly dog 
 You ain't got to get heated at every house warmin' 
 Sittin' here, grillin' people like George Foreman 
 Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Sheila always performin'? 
 The second she storm out, then he storm in 
 Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion 
 And drink some wine like Communion 
 And act like everything fine and if it isn't 
 We ain't lettin' everybody in our family business 
 (All the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings) 
 They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things) 
 They don't mean a thing 
 (All the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings) 
 They don't mean a thing, a thing 
 And I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings) 
 They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things) 
 All these fancy things 
 I tell you that all (all the glitter is not gold) my weight in gold (gold is not reality) 
 Now all I know I know all these things (real is what you live to be) 
 (Ooh) All these things (these things)

 The all around the world Digital Underground Pac 
 The Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer of the Roc 
 I take my chain, my fifteen seconds of fame 
 And come back next year with the whole fucking game 
 Ain't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top 
 They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop 
 Then maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself 
 Roc-A-Fella's only niggas that helped 
 My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair 
 Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air, here 
 They say he bougie, he big-headed 
 Would you please stop talking about how my dick head is 
 Flow infectious, give me ten seconds 
 I'll have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas 
 It's funny how wasn't nobody interested 
 Till the night I almost killed myself in Lexus

 Kanye West: 
 Now was Kanye the most overlooked? Yes sir 
 Now is Kanye the most overbooked? Yes sir 
 Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest 
 But all they got left is this guy called West 
 That'll take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def 
 Call him Kwali or Kweli, I put him on songs with Jay-Z 
 I'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and ooh 
 It come out sweeter than old Sadie 
 Nice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards 
 Girl he had with him, ass coulda won the horse awards 
 And I was almost famous, now everybody love Kanye, I'm almost Raymond 
 Some say he arrogant, can y'all blame him? 
 It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him 
 Last year shoppin' my demo, I was tryin' to shine 
 Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme 
 Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem 
 Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams 
 I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed 
 But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh 
 So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more 
 You niggas wear suits 'cause you can't dress no more 
 You can't say shit to Kanye West no more 
 I rocked twenty thousand people, I was just on tour, nigga 
 I'm Kan, the Louis Vuitton Don 
 Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom 
 I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards 
 I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars 
 I went to the malls and I balled too hard 
 ""Oh my god, is that a black card?"" 
 I turned around and replied, ""Why yes 
 But I prefer the term African American Express"" 
 Brains, power, and muscle, like Dame, Puffy, and Russell 
 Your boy back on his hustle, you know what I've been up to 
 Killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit 
 Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips

 This is the last call for alcohol, for my niggas (Mr. Rockefeller) 
 So get your ass up off the wall, all 
 Kanye West: 
 So this A&R over at Roc-A-Fella, named Hip Hop picked the ""Truth"" beat for Beanie and I was in the session with him 
 I had my demo with me, you know, like I always do 
 I play the songs, he's like ""Who that spittin'?"" I'm like ""It's me,"" he's like ""Oh, well okay"" 
 Uh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth 
 Just askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, 'cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' with 
 And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID 
 And No ID told him, ""Look man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap"" 
 (Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap) 
 I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper and a producer 
 (I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper) 
 I'm like ""Oh shit"" 
 I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also 
 People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game 
 If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here 
 So you know, after they picked that Truth beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that 
 I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and be able to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off layaway, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then 
 I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample 
 I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, ""Oh, yo that shit is crazy, Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called the Dynasty"" 
 And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me 
 So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time and really I just, like bit the drums off ""Xxplosive"" and put it like with it sped up, sampled 
 And now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on ""This Can't be Life"" 
 And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on the Dynasty album 
 I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound and you know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management 
 I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop 'cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' 'cause I been there for a while I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change to try to move up to the next level 
 And that day, I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet Jay-Z and he said, ""Oh you a real soulful dude"" 
 (Oh you a real soulful dude, man) 
 And he, uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio, you know how he do it, one take 
 And he said, ""Tell me what you think of this"" 
 (Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here) 
 And I heard it, and I was thinking like, ""Man, I really wanted more like of the simple type Jay-Z"" 
 I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the in my personal opinion 
 So he asked me, ""What you think of it?"" 
 (So what you think of this?) 
 And I was like, ""Man that shit tight"" 
 You know what I'm sayin', man what I'mma tell him? 
 I was on the train, man, you know 
 So after that I went back home and man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing 
 You know, I got groups, I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like, poppin' off the way it should have been 
 One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed 
 But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company 
 So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company 
 And I got evicted at the same time 
 So I went down and tracked the beats from him 
 I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out 
 So I ain't have to deal with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk 
 Me and my mother drove to Newark, New Jersey 
 (Come on, let's just go) 
 I hadn't even seen my apartment 
 I remember I pulled up, I unpacked all my shit 
 (Kanye, baby, we're here) 
 You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself 
 I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, ""Heart of the City"" 
 And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats 
 And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did ""Nothing Like It"" already at that time 
 But then Jay walked in, I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on 
 I remember it like, like it was yesterday 
 And Hip Hop said, ""Yo play that one beat for him"" 
 So I played ""Heart of the City"" and really I made ""Heart of the City,"" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX 
 (No I think Jay gon' like this one right here) 
 And I played another beat, and I played another beat and I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like, ""Ooh"" 
 Two days later, I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame 
 Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, ""Yo, what's up I'm Kanye"" 
 (Yo, you that kid, Kanye?) 
 ""You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to beats G"" 
 (Yo, Jay got classics, G) 
 You know I ain't talkin' shit 
 I'm like, ""Oh shit"" 
 And all this time, I'm starstruck, man, I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes and they still are, you know 
 So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days 
 I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story 
 The day I did the 'Can't Be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S., he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly 
 And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people 
 I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, ""Yo Jay I could rap"" 
 And I spit this rap that said, uh, ""I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit 
 Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips"" 
 And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line 
 But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response, he said, ""Man, that was tight"" 
 (That, that was cool, that was hot) 
 That was it, you know, I ain't get no deal then, haha 
 Okay, fast forward 
 So, Blueprint, ""H to the Izzo,"" my first hit single 
 And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people, my relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper 
 Because, you know, of course later he allowed me to go on tour with him 
 Man, yo, I appreciate, I love him for that 
 And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats 
 ""Gimme a beat that sound like Jay-Z,"" You know, they dick riders, whatever 
 So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll 
 Be like, ""Yo but I rap too."" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy 'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever 
 Everybody out there listen here, I played them ""Jesus Walks"" and they didn't sign me 
 You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say ""Naw"" 
 Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels, Jessica Rivera, man 
 (Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real) 
 I'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up 
 (Y'all niggas is stupid) 
 Let's just say I didn't get my deal 
 The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? 
 The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records 
 He wanted to sign me really bad 
 (We gonna change the game, buddy) 
 Dame was like, ""Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack"" 
 (You gotta make sure it's not wack) 
 Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and 
 Dame was in the room 
 So I played, actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it 
 So, it's called ""Wow"" 
 ""I go to Jacob with twenty-five thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow 
 I got eleven plaques on my walls right now 
 You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow,"" like the chorus went 
 Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it 
 So I play that song for him, and he's like, ""Oh shit"" 
 (Oh shit, it's not even wack) 
 ""I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot"" 
 (It's actually kinda hot) 
 Like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper 
 And I'm sure Dame figured, ""Like man, if he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know 
 So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like ""Yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick"" 
 (You don't wanna catch a brick) 
 ""You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on"" 
 I told Hip Hop and Hip Hop was all, ""Oh, word?"" 
 Actually, even with that I was still about to take the deal with Capitol 'cause it was already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3H 
 That, you know, 'cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do 
 Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, ""Oh he's just a producer rapper"" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right 
 The day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do man, I had picked out clothes 
 I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go 
 And they had Mel call me, they said, ""Yo 
 Capitol pulled on the deal"" 
 (Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal) 
 And, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested 
 And I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever 
 I went up 
 I called G, I said, ""Man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?"" 
 Tony Williams: 
 So won't you raise your glass, won't you? 
 So won't you raise your glass, won't you? 
 So won't you raise your glass, won't you? 
 So won't you raise your glass, won't you?"
20,Kanye West,hiphop,Wake Up Mr. West,"Oh, whoa ho ho

 ""Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today"" 
 From the Chi, like Tim it's a harder way 
 So this is in the name of love like Robert say 
 Before you ask me to go get a job today 
 Can I at least get a raise of the minimum wage? 
 And I know that the government administer AIDS 
 So I guess we just pray like the minister say 
 Allahu Akbar and throw him some hot cars 
 Things we see on the screen that's not ours 
 But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far 
 Where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars 
 But they can't cop cars without seeing cop cars 
 I guess they want us all behind bars, I know it 
 Kanye West and Adam Levine: 
 Uh, and I heard 'em say 
 ""Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today"" 
 And I heard 'em say 
 ""Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today"" 
 But we'll a find a way 
 (And nothing last forever but be honest babe 
 It hurts but it may be the only way) 
 Kanye West: 
 They say people in your life are seasons 
 And anything that happen is for a reason 
 And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing 
 And gram keep praying and keep believing 
 In Jesus, and one day that you see him 
 Till they walk in his footsteps and try to be him 
 The devil is alive I feel him breathin' 
 Claiming money is the key, so keep on dreamin' 
 And put them lottery tickets just to tease us 
 My Aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down 
 So now my little cousin smokin' them cigarettes now 
 His job try to claim that he too niggerish now 
 Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now? 
 I can't figure it out, I'm sick of it now 
 Kanye West and Adam Levine: 
 Uh, and I heard 'em say 
 ""Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today"" 
 And I heard 'em say 
 Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today 
 But we'll a find a way 
 (And nothing last forever but be honest babe 
 It hurts but it may be the only way) 
 Adam Levine: 
 With every worthless word, we get more far away 
 And nothing's ever promised tomorrow today 
 And nothing last forever but be honest babe 
 It hurts but it may be the only way"

 You will see him on TV, any given Sunday 
 Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai 
 She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money 
 She went to the doctor got lipo with your money 
 She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money 
 Should've got that insured, GEICO for your money 
 (money...money) 
 If you ain't no punk 
 Holla we want prenup (We want prenup!) 
 Yeah, it's something that you need to have 
 'Cause when she leave your ass she gon' leave with half 
 Eighteen years, eighteen years 
 And on her eighteenth birthday, he found out it wasn't his 
 (She gives me money) 
 Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger, uh 
 (When I'm in need) 
 But she ain't messin' wit' no broke niggas, uh

 Now I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs 
 You don't want a dude to smoke but he can't buy weed 
 You got out to eat and he can't pay, y'all can't leave 
 There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves 
 But while y'all washin', watch him 
 He gon' make it into a Benz out of that Datsun 
 He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes 
 This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries 
 So, stick by his side 
 I know there's dude's ballin', but yeah that's nice 
 And they gon' keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl 
 And when you get on, he leave yo' ass for a white girl

 Broke Phi Broke, we ain't got it. 
 Broke Phi Broke (we ain't got it) 
 No, we have no money 
 We are sharin' jeans. 
 If I go outside, I got the only clothing on. 
 How many cars do we own? (None!) 
 How many cars do we own? (None, sir!) 
 Should we let our woman go and be with the cat in the car? 
 Yes, we will. 
 Why? Because we can't afford gas. Say it with me!

25,Kanye West,hiphop,Drive Slow,"Drive slow, homie 
 Drive slow, homie 
 You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie 
 You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie 
 My homie Marley used to stay 79th and May 
 One of my best friends from back in the day 
 Down the street from Calumet, a school for the Stones 
 He nicknamed me K-Rock so they would leave me alone 
 Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off 
 And walked around the mall with his radio face off 
 Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand 
 Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man 
 Back when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of Caprices 
 Drove by the teachers, even more by polices 
 How'd he get the cash? The day his father passed away 
 Left him with a little somethin', sixteen he was stuntin' 
 Al B. Sure nigga with the hair all wavy 
 Hit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy 
 Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty 
 Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby 
 See back-back then-then, if you had a car 
 You was the Chi-Town version of Baby 
 And I was just a virgin, a baby 
 One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy 
 I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked 
 Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked 
 We'd take a Saturday and just circle the mall 
 They had they Lincolns and Auroras, we was hurtin' 'em all 
 With the girls a lot of flirtin' involved, but dog 
 Fuck all that flirtin', I'm tryin' to get in some drawers 
 So put me on with these hoes, homie 
 He told me don't rush to get grown, drive slow, homie 
 Drive slow, homie 
 Drive slow 
 You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie 
 You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie 
 Paul Wall: 
 What it do? I'm posted up in the parking lot, my trunk waving 
 The candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazing 
 Them elbows pokin' wide on that candy 'Lac 
 Trunk open, screens on, neons lit with fifth relaxed 
 I'm on a mission for dime-pieces and sexy ladies 
 Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes 
 It's a star-studded event when I valet park 
 Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark 
 You see them fours crawling? You see them screens falling? 
 The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin' 
 I'm leaning on the switch, sitting crooked in my slab 
 But I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab 
 A young Houston hard hitter all about the scrilla 
 Ridin' something candy coated, crawling like a caterpillar 
 I'm tipping on them fours, I'm jamming on that Screw 
 I'm looking for them hoes, baby, what it do? Drive slow, homie 
 GLC and Kanye West: 
 Turn your hazard lights of when you see them hoes (Drive slow, homie) 
 If you're riding around the city with nowhere to go (Drive slow, homie) 
 Live today, 'cause tomorrow, man, you never know 
 (You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie 
 You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie) 
 (My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib 
 I got more TVs in here than where I live) 
 And that don't make no sense, but baby, I'm the shit 
 And everything I flip, you know it's something serious 
 I got the custom grill, I got the Brabus rims 
 I got the baller genetics, baby, this evidence 
 You see a player flicking, and how you ain't convinced 
 That you should go on and kiss it, just a little bit (Just a little bit) 
 I got my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain 
 My canaries is gleamin' through my angel wings 
 They see me, hoes actin' like they seen a king 
 With that mean lean, smoking on that finest Cali green 
 My woodgrain oak, I'm ridin' on Vogues 
 My cylinder quiet, like tip-toes 
 I sold O's, and this I know 
 When you see them hoes, little homie, drive slow 
 Kanye West: 
 Yeah, drive slow, homie 
 Drive slow, homie 
 You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie 
 You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie 
 Drive slow, homie"
26,Kanye West,hiphop,My Way Home,"Common and Gil Scott-Heron: 
 Yeah 
 (I'm on way home) 
 Common: 
 They say home is where the hate is, my dome is where fate is 
 I stroll where souls get lost like Vegas 
 Seen through the eyes of rebel glasses 
 Pray to God that my arms reach the masses 
 The young smoke grass in grassless jungles 
 Rubber band together in cashless bundles 
 We wear strugglin' chains, divided only hustle remains 
 Makin' sense of it, we hustle for change 
 Revolution ain't a game it's another name for life fightin' 
 Someone to stay in they corner like Mike Tyson 
 Hypes fightin' for hits to heighten they hell 
 Don't he know he could only get as high as he fell? 
 Show money becomes bail, relationships become jail 
 Children are unheld, I wish love was for sale 
 Behold the pale horse got me trapped like R. Kell, I bail and it 
 Gil Scott-Heron: 
 Might not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again 
 I'm on my way home 
 I left three days ago, but no one seems to know I'm gone 
 Home is where the hatred is 
 Home is filled with pain and it 
 Might not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again"

 Kanye West: 
 How we stop the Black Panthers? 
 Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer 
 You hear that? What Gil Scott was hearing 
 When our heroes or heroines got hooked on heroin 
 Crack raised the murder rate in D.C. and Maryland 
 We invested in that, it's like we got Merrill lynched 
 And we been hangin' from the same tree ever since 
 Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine 
 So we, cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it sell it 
 The fiends cop it, nowadays they can't tell if 
 That's that good shit, we ain't sure man 
 Put the CD on your tongue, yeah that's pure man

 How the Mexicans say, we just tryin' to party holmes 
 They wanna pack us all in a box like styrofoam 
 Who gave Saddam anthrax? 
 George Bush got the answers 
 Back in the hood, it's a different type of chemical 
 Arm & Hammer baking soda raised they own quota 
 Right when our soldiers, ran for the stove 'cause 
 'Cause, dreams of being Hova 
 Went from bein' a broke man to bein' a dopeman 
 To bein' the President, look there's hope man 
 This that inspiration for the Moes and the Folks man 
 Shorty come and see his momma straight overdosin' 
 And this is the soundtrack 
 This the type of music that you make when you 'round that

 Malik Yusef: 
 Our Father, give us this day, our daily bread 
 Before the feds give us these days and take our daily bread 
 See I done did all this ol' bullshit 
 And to atone, I throw a little somethin' somethin' on the pulpit 
 We took that shit, measured it and then cooked that shit 
 And what we gave back was crack music 
 And now we ooze it through they nooks and crannies 
 So our mamas ain't got to be they cooks and nannies 
 And we gon' repo everything they ever took from granny 
 Now the former slaves trade hooks for Grammys 
 This dark diction has become America's addiction 
 Those who ain't even black use it 
 We gon' keep baggin' up this here crack music"
28,Kanye West,hiphop,Roses,"I know it's past visiting hours but can I please give her these flowers? 
 The doctor don't wanna take procedures, he claim her heart can't take the anaesthesia 
 It'll send her body into a seizure, that little thing by the hospital bed, it'll stop beepin' 
 Hey chick, I'm at a loss for words 
 What do you say at this time, ""Remember when I was nine?"" 
 Tell her everything gon' be fine, but I be lyin' 
 Her family cryin', they want her to live, and she tryin' 
 I'm arguin like, ""What kind of doctor can we fly in?"" 
 You know the best medicine go to people that's paid 
 If Magic Johnson got a cure for AIDS and all the broke motherfuckers passed away 
 You telling me if my grandma's in the NBA, right now she'd be okay? 
 But since she was just a secretary, worked for the church for thirty-five years 
 Things supposed to stop right here, my grandfather tryin' to pull it together, he's strong 
 That's where I get my confidence from 
 I asked the nurse, ""Did you do the research?"" 
 She asked me, ""Can you sign some T-shirts?"" 
 Bitch, is you smokin' reefer? 
 You don't see that we hurt? But still 
 Bill Withers: 
 I smile when Rosie comes to see me 
 And I can't wait for a sunny day (Seeing it through your eyes) 
 Can't wait for the clouds to break 
 Kanye West: 
 They outside of the emergency room, room, you can feel my heartbeat, beat, beat 
 If she gon' pull through, we gon' find out soon but right now she asleep, sleep, sleep 
 My mama say they say she could pass away anyday 
 Hey chick, what these doctors know anyway? 
 Let me see the X-rays, I ain't no expert, I'm just hurt 
 Cousin Kim took off of work 
 Plus my Aunt Shirley, Aunt Beverly, Aunt Clay, and Aunt Jean 
 So many aunties we could have an auntie team 
 Feel like Amerie, it's just one thing when they said that she made it you see they eyes gleam 
 I think we at a all-time high to get there, we run, we fly, we drive 
 'Cause with my family we know where home is so instead of sending flowers, we're the roses 
 Bill Withers: 
 I smile when Rosie comes to see me 
 And I can't wait for a sunny day (Seeing it through your eyes) 
 Can't wait for the clouds to break

 Kanye West: 
 We gon' to Mass today, we have to pray 
 Besides what the pastor say, I have to say since Pac passed away 
 Most you rappers don't even deserve a track from me 
 You see, if you ever wanted to ever be anything 
 There'd always be somebody that shoot down any dream 
 There'll always be haters, that's the way it is 
 Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids 
 But they gon' have to take my life 'fore they take my drive 
 'Cause when I was barely livin', that's what kept me alive 
 Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time 
 Make it out of this grind, 'fore I'm out of my mind 
 And get some leeway on the he say she say 
 Your girl don't like me, how long has she been gay? 
 Spanish girls say, ""Yo, no hablo inglés"" 
 And everybody want to run to me for their single 
 It's funny how these wack niggas need my help 
 Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself 
 Dawg, if I was you, I wouldn't feel myself 
 Dawg, if I was you, I'd kill myself 
 Made a mil' myself and I'm still myself 
 And I'mma look in the mirror if I need some help 
 Now I'll speak from the heart, y'all all frontin' 
 Everybody feel a way about K but at least y'all feel something 
 Brandy: 
 Why'd you come then? 
 I bet only for getting what some get would get ya 
 What kinda dream we found? 
 See I'm often at your crossways 
 Forgetting where the hell I met ya 
 And try to bring me down 
 I always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down, way down, way down 
 Always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down 
 Always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down

 Then I'll get the lotion, and do somethin' to me, when your thighs is exposed 
 There's no turning back now, I mean I don't mean to impose 
 Not now but right now, I need you to undress, and then pose 
 I'm into that now, catch a vibe, when the doors, get closed

 They're all I need to please me 
 They can't stimulate or tease me 
 They won't leave in the night 
 I've no fear that they might 
 Desert me 
 Diamonds are forever, forever, forever 
 Throw your diamonds in the sky 
 If you feel the vibe 
 Diamonds are forever, forever, forever 
 The ROC is still alive 
 Every time I rhyme 
 Forever and ever! 
 For ever, ever? For ever, ever? Ever, ever? 
 Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? 
 Good Morning, this ain't Vietnam 
 Still, people lose hands, legs, arms for real 
 Little was known of Sierra Leone 
 And how it connect to the diamonds we own 
 When I speak of diamonds in this song 
 I ain't talkin' 'bout the ones that be glowin' 
 I'm talkin' bout Roc-a-fella, my home, my chain 
 These ain't conflict diamonds, is they Jacob? 
 Don't lie to me man 
 See, a part of me sayin' keep shinin', 
 How? when I know of the blood diamonds 
 Though it's thousands of miles away 
 Sierra Leone connect to what we go through today 
 Over here, it's a drug trade, we die from drugs 
 Over there, they die from what we buy from drugs 
 The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses 
 I thought my Jesus Piece was so harmless 
 Till I seen a picture of a shorty armless 
 And here's the conflict 
 It's in a black person's soul to rock that gold 
 Spend ya whole life tryin' to get that ice 
 On a polo rugby it look so nice 
 How could somethin' so wrong make me feel so right, right? 
 'Fore I beat myself up like Ike 
 You could still throw ya Rocafella diamond tonight, 'cause 
 Diamonds are forever, forever, forever 
 Throw ya diamonds in the sky 
 If you feel the vibe 
 Diamonds are forever forever forever

 Everytime I rhyme 
 Forever and ever! 
 For ever, ever? For ever, ever? Ever, ever? 
 Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? 
 People askin' me is I'm gon' give my chain back (uh) 
 That'll be the same day I give the game back (uh) 
 You know the next question dog 'yo, where Dame at?'(uh) 
 This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back (whoo!) 
 'Wassup wit you a Jay man, are y'all okay man?' 
 (Jay-Z) 
 Yep! 
 I got it from her 'ye damn! 
 The chain remains, the game is in tact 
 The name is mine, I'll take blame for that 
 The pressure's on, but guess who ain't gon' crack? [laughs] 
 Pardon me I had to laugh at that 
 How could you falter when you're the rock of Gibraltar 
 I had to get of the boat so I could walk on water 
 This ain't no tall order, this is nothin' to me 
 Difficult takes a day, impossible takes a week 
 I do this in my sleep, 
 I sold Kilos of coke, so? 
 I'm guessin' I can sell CD's 
 I'm not a businessman, I'm a business, man 
 Let me handle my business, damn! 
 Kanyeez you got me, Freeway and Foxy 
 YG', Teairra Mari, Petey watch me 
 Bleek could be one hit away his whole career 
 As long as I'm alive, he's a millionaire 
 And even if I die, he's in my will somewhere 
 So he can just kick back and chill somewhere, oh yeah 
 He don't even have to write rhymes 
 The dynasty like my money last 3 lifetimes 
 Shirley Bassey was in the rear sayin' exactly 
 What I was sayin' practically me whole career 
 The diamond is forever, I been minin' this forever 
 Now the Louis Vuitton Don's timin' couldn't be better 
 People lined up to see the Titanic sinkin' 
 Instead we rose from the ash like a phoenix 
 If you waitin' for the end, the dynasty signed 
 And what seemed like forever is a mighty long time

 By broke slaves, years ago 
 Who did not have, years ago 
 By broke brothas in the 20s, years ago 
 Who did not have when we could not eat 
 Hmm, remember that? 
 Eating all of our cereal with forks because we wanted to save the milk, do you remember that? Hmm? 
 Do you remember all those Christmases when your Mama walked in the room and pretended she was the tree, huh? 
 Remember that?"
35,Kanye West,hiphop,Hey Mama,"Hey Mama, I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you 
 And Let me tell you what I'm about to do, Hey Mama 
 I know I act a fool but I promise you I'm goin' back to school 
 And I appreciate what you allowed for me 
 And I just want you to be proud of me. 
 Hey Mama. 
 I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine 
 This little light of mine and I'm finna let it shine 
 I'm finna take y'all back to them better times 
 I'm gonna talk about my mama if y'all don't mind 
 I was 3 years old, when you and I moved to the Chi 
 Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold 
 You fixed me up somethin' that was good for my soul 
 Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl? 
 You work late nights just to keep on the lights 
 Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike 
 And you would give anything in this world 
 Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl 
 And you never put no man over me 
 And I love you for that Mommy can't you see? 
 7 years old, I caught you with tears in your eyes 
 Cause a nigga cheatin' tellin' you lies then I started to cry 
 As we knelt on the kitchen floor 
 I said Mommy I'm a love you so you don't hurt no more 
 And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more 
 And I'm a get you that mansion that we couldn't afford 
 See your unbreakable unmistakable 
 Highly capable, lady that's makin' loot 
 A livin' legend too, just look at what heaven do 
 Send us an angel, and I thank you. 
 Hey Mama, I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you 
 And Let me tell you what I'm about to do, Hey Mama 
 I know I act a fool but I promise you I'm goin' back to school 
 And I appreciate what you allowed for me 
 And I just want you to be proud of me. 
 Hey Mama. 
 Forrest Gump mama said, life is like a box of chocolates 
 My mama told me ""Go to school get your doctorate."" 
 Somethin' to fall back on, you could profit with 
 But still supported me when I did the opposite 
 Now I feel like it's things I gotta get 
 Things I gotta do, just to prove to you 
 You was gettin' through, can the choir please 
 Give me a verse of ""You Are So Beautiful To Me?"" 
 Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry 
 Maya Angelou, Nicky Jovanni, turn 1 page and there's my Mommy 
 Come on Mommy just dance with me, let the whole world see your dancing feet 
 Now when I say ""Hey"" y'all say ""Mama"" now everybody answer me. 
 Hey Mama, I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you 
 And Let me tell you what I'm about to do, Hey Mama 
 I know I act a fool but I promise you I'm goin' back to school 
 And I appreciate what you allowed for me 
 And I just want you to be proud of me. 
 Hey Mama. 
 I guess it also depends though, if my ends low 
 Second they get up you gon' get that Benzo 
 Tint the windows, ride around the city and let your friends know. 
 Hey Mama. 
 Tell your job you gotta fake 'em out 
 Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out 
 To a restaurant, upper echelon 
 I'm a get you a jag, whatever else you want 
 Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like? 
 Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right 
 It don't gotta be Mother's Day, or your birthday 
 For me to just call and say ""Hey Mama."" 
 I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you 
 And Let me tell you what I'm about to do, Hey Mama. 
 You know I love you so and I never let you go 
 I wrote this song just so you know no matter where you go my love is true. 
 Hey Mama. 
 Hey Mama. 
 Hey Mama. 
 Hey Mama. 
 Hey Mama.

 There is an imposter among us. 
 This brother right here has been out making beats on the side, yes he has. 
 Pretending he's broke walking amongst us. 
 This brother has been eating every day, can you believe that? Eating every day. 
 Pretending he's with us, he's not one of us. 
 I did not want to believe this, but I walked into the brother Kanye's closet and I found new shoes. 
 I found new shoes! 
 Kanye, would you like to step forward and explain these new shoes?! 
 [Kanye: (stammering)] I was-you crazy, I wasn't, I didn't, um, I was just um, I was-

 But it's too late 
 It's too late, he's gone 
 Kanye West: 
 You sweat her and I ain't talkin' 'bout a Coogi 
 You a Big L and I ain't talkin' 'bout Cool J 
 See me at the airport, at least twenty Louis 
 Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay 
 (Brother Numpsay) Groupies say I'm too choosy 
 Take 'em to the show and talk all through the movies 
 Says she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays 
 If we up in Fridays, I still have it my way 
 Otis Redding, Cam'ron, and Kanye West: 
 (Gone) We striving home 
 (Gone) (I ride on chrome), it's too late 
 Kanye West: 
 Y'all don't want no prob' from me 
 What you rappers could get is a job from me 
 Maybe you could be my intern 
 And in turn, I'll show you how I cook up summer in the winter 
 Aaron love the raw dog, when will he learn? 
 Caught something on the Usher tour, he had to let it burn 
 Plus he already got three children 
 Arguin' over babysitters like, ""Bitch it's yo' turn"" 
 ""Damn Ye it'd be stupid to diss you 
 Even your superficial raps is super-official"" 
 Roc pastel with Gucci on 
 With TV's in the ride, throw a movie on 
 Said he couldn't rap, now he at the top with Doobie Long 
 'Cause I dookied on any song that they threw me on, gone 
 Cam'ron and Otis Redding: 
 We striving home, gone 
 (I ride on chrome), gone 
 We striving home, gone

 Killa Cam, hustler, grinder, guerilla true 
 Oh my chinchilla blue, blue you ever dealt with a dealer 
 Well here's the deal, ma we going to the dealer, woo 
 No concealing, no ceiling I don't need a roof 
 Act up, get out, I don't need you poof 
 Poof be gone, damn tough luck dag 
 Dag, niggas still doing puff-puff-pass 
 Pull the truck up fast and I tell em 
 Hey back in a touched up Jag shit 
 Y'all niggas wanna get in Cam's cerebellum 
 An old man just gon' tell em, ""Too late, he's gone"" 
 Then I see how y'all gonna react when I'm gone 
 My last girl want me back then I'm on 
 Fine stay, you got the grind hey 
 Came back, read what the sign say, ""Too late, he's gone) 
 Yes I know you wanna see my demise 
 Yeah you church boy, acting like a thief in disguise 
 Ain't even my size, see the greed in my eyes 
 Ask Abby, I hustle, brought weed to the Chi, shit 
 And that ain't even a lie, please believe me 
 Gave Weezie a piece of the pie and 
 You can ask George or Regina 
 The whole West Side I explore with the Bimmer now 
 We striving home 
 I ride on chrome 
 Listen, homeboy, move on 
 That's your best bet, why's that, Cons? 
 Consequence: 
 I been pouring out some liquor for the fact that my pal's gone 
 And trying to help his mama with the fact that her child gone 
 And since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon 
 Guess it's only right that I should help her from now on 
 But since they got afoul on, what could've gone wrong? 
 Now they asking Cons, ""How long has this gone on?"" 
 And maybe all this money might have gone to my head 
 'Cause they got me thinking money might have gone to the Feds 
 So I had gone to the dread, but he had gone up to bed 
 And when I came the next morning he was gone with my bread 
 And with that being said I had gone on my instincts 
 And gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks 
 But looking back now, I should've gone to the crib 
 And rented 
 Gone With the Wind 
 'cause I'd a-gone in by ten 
 But I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar 
 And heard a nigga talking shit so I had gone to the car 
 And now the judge is telling me that I had gone too far 
 And now we gone for twenty years doing time behind bars 
 And since I gone to a cell for some petty crimes 
 I guess I gone to the well one too many times 'cause I'm gone 
 Kanye West: 
 I'm ahead of my time, sometimes years out 
 So the powers that be won't let me get my ideas out 
 And that make me wanna get my advance out 
 And move to Oklahoma and just live at my aunt's house 
 Yeah, I romance the thought of leaving it all behind 
 Kanye step away from the lime 
 Light like when I was on the grind in the 1999 
 Before model chicks was bending over 
 Or dealerships asked me, ""Benz or Rover"" 
 Man, if I could just get one beat on Hova 
 We could get up off this cheap-ass sofa 
 What the summer of the Chi got to offer an eighteen-year-old 
 Sell drugs or get a job, you gotta play your role 
 My dog worked at Taco Bell, hooked us up plural 
 Fired a week later, the manager count the churros 
 Sometimes I can't believe it when I look up in the mirro' 
 How we out in Europe, spending Euros 
 They claim you never know what you got till it's gone 
 I know I got it, I don't know what y'all on 
 I'mma open up a store for aspiring emcees 
 Won't sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is free 
 But if they ever flip sides like Anakin 
 You'll sell everything including the mannequin 
 They got a new bitch, now you Jennifer Aniston 
 Hold on, I'll handle it, don't start panickin', stay calm 
 Shorties at the door 'cause they need more 
 Inspiration for they life, they souls, and they songs 
 They said, ""Sorry, Mr. West is gone"""
39,Kanye West,hiphop,Diamonds From Sierra Leone,"Diamonds are forever 
 They won't leave in the night 
 I've no fear that they might 
 Desert me 
 Diamonds are forever (forever, forever) 
 Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe 
 Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever) 
 The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme. 
 Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?... 
 Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic 
 Vegas on acid, 
 Seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses 
 And I've realized that I've arrived, 'cause 
 It take more than a magazine to kill my Vibrate does 
 He write his own rhymes, so sort of 
 I think 'em 
 That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought up 
 Damn, is he really that caught up? 
 I ask if you talkin' bout classics, do my name get brought up? 
 I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort or even a four-track recorder 
 So its only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche 
 - Its for yourself that's important 
 If you're a stripper named Porscha and you get tips from many men 
 Then your fat friend her nickname is Minivan 
 Excuse me, 
 That's just the Henny, man, I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop I can't because 
 Diamonds are forever (forever, forever) 
 Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe 
 Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever) 
 The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme. 
 Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?... 
 I was sick about awards 
 Couldn't nobody cure me 
 Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry 
 Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense to them 
 30 minutes later seems there's no convincing them 
 What more could you ask for? 
 The international asshole 
 Who complains about what he is owed? 
 And throw a tantrum like he is three years old 
 You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul 
 And wouldn't change by the change, or the game, or the fame, 
 When he came, in the game, he made his own lane 
 Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name 
 Its Kanye - But some of my plaques - they still say Kane 
 Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown 
 Back in the Chi - them folks ain't from Motown 
 Life movin' too fast I need to slow down 
 Girl ain't give me no ass, ya need to go down 
 Diamonds are forever (forever, forever) 
 My father Ben said I need Jesus 
 So he took me to church and let the water wash over my ceaser 
 Diamonds are forever (forever, forever) 
 The preacher said we need leaders 
 Right then my body got still like a paraplegic 
 You know who you can call you gotta best believe it 
 The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it 
 Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic 
 Yeah the beat cold but the flow is anemic 
 After debris settles and the dust get swept off 
 Big K pick up where young Hov left off 
 Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off 
 I dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of 
 A&R's lookin' like ""Pssh we messed up"" 
 Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up 
 Bottle after bottle till we got messed up 
 In the studio, where really though, yeah he next up 
 People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back 
 That'll be the same day I give the game back 
 You know the next question dog ""Yo, where Dame at?"" 
 This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back 
 ""What's up with you and Jay, man, are y'all ok man?"" 
 They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen 
 R-r-r-right here stands a-man 
 With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands... 
 Diamonds are forever (forever, forever) 
 Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe 
 Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever) 
 The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme. 
 Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?...

 Everybody want it but it ain't that serious 
 Mmm hmm, that's that shit 
 So if you gon' do it, do it just like this 
 Donald Fagen: 
 Did you realize 
 That you were a champion in their eyes? 
 Kanye West: 
 You don't see just how wild the crowd is? 
 You don't see just how fly my style is? 
 I don't see why I need a stylist 
 When I shop so much I can speak Italian 
 I don't know I just want it better for my kids 
 And I ain't sayin' we was from the projects 
 But every time I wanted, layaway or a deposit 
 My daddy'd say, ""When you see clothes, close your eyelids"" 
 We was sort of like Will Smith and his son 
 In the movie, I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones 
 'Cause every summer he'd get some 
 Brand new hare-brained scheme to get rich from 
 And I don't know what he did for dough 
 But he'd send me back to school wit' a new wardrobe 
 Donald Fagen and Kanye West: 
 (And hey, hey, hey, hey) 
 Did you realize 
 That you were a champion in their eyes? 
 Kanye West: 
 I think he did, when he packed it up and brought it back to the crib 
 Just a little somethin' show you how we lived 
 Everything I wanted man it seemed so serious 
 Mmm hmm, that's that shit 
 So if you gon' do it, do it just like this 
 Donald Fagen: 
 Did you realize 
 That you were a champion in their eyes? 
 Kanye West: 
 When it feel like living's harder than dying 
 For me giving up's way harder than trying 
 Lauryn Hill said her heart was in Zion 
 I wish her heart still was in rhyming 
 'Cause who the kids gon' listen to, huh? 
 I guess me if it isn't you 
 Last week, I paid a visit to the institute 
 They got the dropout keeping kids in the school 
 I guess I cleaned up my act like Prince'd do 
 If not for pleasure, then at least for the principle 
 They got the CD, they got to see me 
 Drop gems like I dropped out of PE 
 They used to feel invisible 
 Now they know they invincible 
 Donald Fagen and Kanye West: 
 (Hey, hey, hey) 
 Did you realize 
 That you were a champion in their eyes? 
 Connie Mitchell: 
 This is the story of a champion 
 Runners on your mark and they pop the guns 
 Stand up, stand up, here he comes 
 Tell me what it takes to be number one 
 Tell me what it takes to be number one

 You hope that he get what he deserves, word 
 Do you even remember what the issue is? 
 You just trying to find where the tissue is 
 You can still be who you wish you is 
 It ain't happen yet 
 And that's what intuition is 
 When you hop back in the car 
 Drive back to the crib 
 Run back to their arms 
 The smokescreens 
 The chokes and the screams 
 You ever wonder what it all really means?

 And I wonder if you know

 And I wonder if you know 
 What it means to find your dreams

 And I'm back on my grind 
 A psychic read my lifeline 
 Told me in my lifetime 
 My name would help light up the Chicago skyline 
 And that's why I'm 
 Seven o'clock, that's primetime 
 Heaven'll watch, God calling from the hotlines 
 Why he keep giving me hot lines? 
 I'm a star, how could I not shine? 
 How many ladies in the house? 
 How many ladies in the house without a spouse? 
 Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused 
 What you about?

 You wonder if you'll ever find your dreams?"

 Man, it's so hard not to act reckless

 Get arrested guess until he get the message 
 I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny 
 And what I do, act more stupidly 
 Bought more jewelry 
 More Louis V, my mama couldn't get through to me 
 The drama, people suing me 
 I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me 
 I'm just saying how I feel man (Why were you late?)

 Straight from a page of your favorite author 
 And the weather so breezy

 I'm pop the Barkers, I'm hood the Parkers 
 While y'all was in limbo, I raised the bar up 
 I touched on everything 
 Married to the game, roc-a-chain 'stead of a wedding ring 
 Y'all bridesmaids catch the garter 
 On nights when Ye romance, cameras flash so much 
 That I gotta do that Yayo dance 
 I'm on a world tour with Common, my man 
 After each and every show a couple dykes in the van

 How I'm suppose to stand out when everybody get dressed up? 
 So yeah, at the Grammys I went ultra Travolta 
 Yeah, that tuxedo might have been a little guido 
 But with my ego, I can stand there in a speedo 
 And be looked at like a fucking hero 
 The glory, the story, the chain, the polo, the night 
 The grind, the empty bottles of No-Doz 
 Tank on empty, whipping my mama Volvo 
 I spent that gas money on clothes with logos 
 The fur is Hermes, shit that you don't floss 
 The Goyard so hard man, I'm Hugo's boss 
 Why I gotta ask what that Tudor cost 
 House on the hill, two doors from Tracey Ross 
 And I'm asking about her girlfriends, yeah, the dark skinned ones 
 She asking about the speed boats yeah I admit we rented 'em 
 When you meet me in person what do you feel like? 
 I know, I know I look better in real life 
 I hear people compare themselves to big a lot 
 You know B.I.G. and Pac, you know to get it hot 
 I guess after I live I wanna be compared to B.I.G. 
 Anyone, Big Pun, Big L, or Notorious 
 Till then, get money and stunt and stay glorious

 Chris Martin and Kanye West: 
 I'm coming home again 
 Do you think about me now and then? (Yeah) 
 Do you think about me now and then? 
 'Cause I'm coming home again 
 I'm in home again (Ow) 
 Kanye West: 
 I met this girl when I was 3 years old 
 And what I loved most she had so much soul 
 She said ""Excuse me lil homey, I know you don't know me 
 But, my name is Windy and I like to blow trees"" 
 And from that point I never blow her off 
 Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off 
 They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off 
 And make 'em straighten up their hat cause she know they soft 
 And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown 
 In the nighttime her face lit up, so astounding 
 I told her in my heart is where she'll always be 
 She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave 
 She said it felt like they walked and drove on me 
 Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me 
 I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me 
 She said, ""'Ye, keep making that keep making that platinum and gold for me"" 
 Chris Martin: 
 I'm coming home again 
 Do you think about me now and then? 
 Do you think about me now and then? 
 'Cause I'm coming home again 
 I'm in home again 
 Do you think about me now and then? 
 Do you think about me now and then? Oh 
 Now I'm coming home again 
 Maybe we could start again 
 Kanye West: 
 But if you really cared for her 
 Then you wouldn't have never hit the airport to follow your dreams 
 Sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her 
 It always seems like she talking 'bout me 
 She said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you 
 They want to rap and make soul beats just like you 
 But they just not you"" and I just got through 
 Talking 'bout what we tryna do: just not new 
 Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong 
 I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone 
 I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home 
 And guess when I heard that? When I was back home 
 Every interview I'm representing you, making you proud 
 Reach for the stars so if you fall, you land on a cloud 
 Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around 
 If you don't know by now, I'm talking 'bout Chi-Town 
 Chris Martin: 
 I'm comin' home again 
 Do you think about me now and then? 
 Do you think about me now and then? 
 'Cause I'm comin' home again 
 I'm in home again 
 Maybe, do you remember when 
 Fireworks at Lake Michigan, oh 
 Now I'm coming home again 
 I'm in home again 
 Maybe you, do you remember when? 
 Fireworks at Lake Michigan, oh 
 Now I'm comin' home again 
 Maybe we can start again 
 Loyee oyeee oh, loyee oyeee oh 
 I'm in home again 
 Loyee oyeee oh, loyee oyeee oh 
 I'm in home again 
 Maybe we can start again"
54,Kanye West,hiphop,Big Brother,"E gon' be there"" but 
 Not only did I not get a chance to spit it 
 Carline told me I could buy two tickets 
 I guess big brother was thinkin' a little different 
 And kept little brother at bay, at a distance 
 But everything that I felt was more bogus 
 Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent 
 Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over 
 I guess I'll understand when I get more older 
 Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem 
 Now I'm on the top and everybody on the scrotum 
 My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother 
 Used to be Dame and Biggs brother 
 Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend 
 No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin 
 Let the story begin 
 If you feel the way I feel, why don't you wave your hands? 
 Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant? 
 Not only a client, the Presidito, hola, Hovito 
 The game gettin' foul so here's a free throw 
 I was always on the other side of the peephole 
 Then I dropped Jesus Walks now I'm on the steeple 
 And we know New Jack City got to keep my brother 
 But to be number one I'mma beat my brother 
 On that Diamonds remix I swore I spazzed 
 Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass 
 Sibling rivalry, only I could see 
 It was the pride in me that was drivin' me 
 At the Grammys, I said, ""I inspired me"" 
 But my big brother who I always tried to be 
 When I kicked a flow it like pick-and-roll 
 'Cause even if he gave me the rock, it's give-and-go 
 I guess Beanie's style was more of a slam dunk 
 But my shit was more like a finger roll 
 But I had them singles though 
 And them hoes at the show gonna mingle, yo, heh, y'all know 
 I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay 
 Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay 
 Back in my mind I'm like ""Damn, no way"" 
 Translate español, ""No way, Jose"" 
 Then I went and told Jay Brown 
 Shoulda known that was gonna come back around 
 Shoulda talked to you like a man, shoulda told you first 
 But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse 
 My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother 
 So here's a few words from ya kid brother 
 If you admire somebody you should go on 'head tell 'em 
 People never get the flowers while they can still smell 'em 
 A idol in my eyes, god of the game 
 Heart of the City, Roc-a-Fella chain 
 Never be the same, never be another 
 Number one, Young Hov, also my big brother 
 My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother 
 Used to be Dame and Biggs brother 
 Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend 
 No I.D., my mentor, and that's where the story ends 
 Toomp killed this shit"

 And she claim she only wit' me for the currency 
 You cut me deep, bitch, cut me like surgery 
 And I was too proud to admit that it was hurtin' me 
 I'd never do that to you, at least purposely 
 We breakin' up again 
 We makin' up again 
 But we don't love no more 
 I guess we fuckin' then 
 Have you ever felt you ever want to kill her? 
 And you mix them emotions with tequilla 
 And you mix that wit' a little bad advice 
 On one of them bad nights, y'all have a bad fight 
 And you talkin' 'bout her family, her aunts and shit 
 And she say, muhfucka, yo mama's a bitch 
 You know, domestic drama and shit, all the attitude 
 I'll never hit a girl, but I'll shake the shit outta you

 This relationship, it even got me back to drinkin' 
 Now this Hennessey, is gonna' be the death of me 
 And I always thought that you havin' my child was our destiny 
 But I can't even vibe wit you sexually 
 'Cause every time that I try you will question me. 
 Saying, you fuckin' them girls, disrespecting me 
 You don't see how your lies is affectin' me 
 You don't see how our life was supposed to be 
 And I never let a nigga get that close to me 
 And you ain't cracked up 
 To what you was supposed to be 
 You always gone, you always be where them hoes will be 
 And it's the first time she ever spilled her soul to me

 I don't wanna say goodbye to you 
 So I'll just say good night to you 
 My people, no goodbyes to you 
 I'm just gonna say good night 
 (Verse - Kanye West) 
 Right now I can see it so vivid 
 Like it was just yesterday like I could relive it 
 Me and my grandparents on a field trid-ip 
 And I'm the little kid tryna touch the exhibits 
 But it'll fade before I get to get a hold of that 
 Man I wish I could stop time like a photograph 
 Every joke that they told I'd know to laugh 
 Man, man I wouldn't let a moment pass 
 What do it mean when you dream that you fallin' 
 What do it mean when you dream that you ballin' 
 What do it mean when you never dream at all then 
 And you don't really know cause you can't recall them 
 It's sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to 
 People you never got a chance to say bye to 
 Maybe you could pull 'em up outta your dreams 
 Into real life, if you try to 
 So close, but so far 
 And so far, no cigar 
 We can't dwell on the day PAST all we got is today 
 So I'mma live like there's no tomorrow 
 No goodbye

 I don't wanna say goodbye to you 
 So I'll just say good night to you 
 My people, no goodbyes to you 
 I'm just gonna say good night

 Uh, to you 
 If I part my art will live through you 
 Dream beautiful and unusual 
 Wake up like everyday new to you 
 Stay true to you, a hood musical 
 My art will live through you 
 Dream beautiful and unusual 
 Wake up like everyday new to you 
 Stay true to you, a hood musical

 I don't wanna say goodbye to you 
 So I'll just say good night to you 
 My people, no goodbyes to you

68,Kanye West,hiphop,Pinocchio Story (Live),"Wise man say, wise man say 
 Wise man say, ""You'll never figure out real love"" 
 Never figure out real love 
 You'll never figure out real love 
 It's so crazy, crazy-crazy, I got everything figured out 
 But for some reason I can never find what real love is about 
 No doubt, everything in the world figured out 
 But I can never seem to find what real love was about 
 Do you think I sacrifice real life 
 For all the fame and flashing lights? 
 Do you think I sacrifice a real life 
 For all the fame and flashing lights 
 There is no Gucci I can buy 
 There is no Louis Vuitton to put on 
 There is no Y.S.L. that they could sell 
 To get my heart, out of this hell and my mind, out of this jail 
 There is no clothes that I could buy 
 That could turn, back in time 
 There is no vacation spot I could fly 
 That could bring back a piece of real life 
 Real life, what does it feel like? 
 I ask you tonight, I ask you tonight 
 What does it feel like? I ask you tonight 
 To live a real life 
 I just wanna be a real boy 
 They always say ""Kanye, he keeps it real boy"" 
 Pinocchio's story is, I just wanna be a real boy 
 Pinocchio's story goes to be a real boy 
 It's funny, Pinocchio, lied, and that's what kept him from it 
 I tell the truth and I keep running 
 It's like I'm lookin' for something out there, tryna find something 
 I turn on the TV, and see me, and see nothing 
 What does it feel like to live real life, to be real? 
 Not some facade on TV that no one can really feel 
 Do you really have the stamina? 
 For everybody that sees you that say, ""Where's my camera?"" 
 For everybody that sees you, to say, ""Sign a autograph"" 
 For everybody that sees you cryin', say, ""You oughta laugh"" 
 You oughta laugh 
 I just wanna be a real boy, Pinocchio's story goes 
 I just wanna be a real boy, Pinocchio's story goes 
 And there is no Gepetto to guide me 
 No one right beside me, the only one was behind me 
 I can't find her no more, I can't follow no more, I can't 
 The only one that come out on the tour and stays 
 Back when I was livin' at home and this was all a big dream 
 And the fame will be get got 
 And the day I moved to LA, maybe that was all my fault 
 All my fault to be a real boy, chasin' the American dream 
 Chasin' everything we seen, up on the TV screen 
 And when uh, the Benz was left, and the clothes was left 
 And the hoes was left, you talk the hoes to death 
 Thinkin' the money that the, you spend the dough to death 
 And tell me what be left for a real boy? 
 They say, ""Kanye, you keep it too real boy""

 Respark the soul and rebuild the energy? 
 We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemy 
 Sorry for the night demons still visit me 
 The plan was to drink until the pain over 
 But what's worse, the pain or the hangover? 
 Fresh air, rolling down the window 
 Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low 
 Don't make me pull the toys out, huh

 Based off the way we was branded 
 Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon 
 And at the airport they check all through my bag and tell me that it's random 
 But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage 
 I need a happy ending and a new beginning 
 And a new fitted and some job opportunities that's lucrative 
 This the real world, homie, school finished

 But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me 
 I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me 
 If a nigga ain't running shootin a jump shot running a track meet 
 But this pimp is, at the top of Mount Olympus 
 Ready for the World's game, this is my Olympics 
 We make 'em say ho 'cause the game is so pimpish 
 Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick

 I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today 
 They rewrite history I don't believe in yesterday 
 And what's a black Beatle anyway? A fucking roach 
 I guess that's why they got me sitting in fucking coach 
 But God said I need a different approach 
 'Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke 
 It's not funny anymore, try different jokes 
 Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, X and O 
 Kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it 
 Play strings for the dramatic and end all of that wack shit 
 Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes 
 I ain't got it I'm going after whoever who has it 
 I'm coming after whoever who has it? 
 You blowing up, that's good, fantastic 
 That y'all, it's like that y'all

 Counting up, smoking, one cuff 
 Live as a red Jag, a Louis bag, grabbing a blunt, fuck it 
 Steam about a hundred and one L's 
 Kites off to jails, buying sweats, running up in Stetson 
 Nigga hat game was special 
 It matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing dice for decimals 
 The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head 
 Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead 
 That meant code red, bent off the black skunk 
 The black Dutch, back of the old shed 
 If you can't live, you dying, you give or buy in 
 Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding 
 Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan 
 Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye

 And my eyes more red than the devil is 
 And I'm bout to take it to another level bitch 
 Matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this 
 Do the rap and the track, triple double no assist 
 And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit 
 Argue with my older bitch acting like I owe her shit 
 I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain 
 Bought the chain that always give me back pain 
 Fuckin' up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane 
 Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent 
 Chick came up to me and said, ""This the number to dial 
 If you wanna make your number one your number two now 
 This that goose and malibu, I call it Malibooyah"" 
 Goddamn, Yeezy, how he hit 'em with the new style 
 Throw that motherfucker, ""Well, whatchu gon' do now? 
 Whatever ever I wanna do, gosh it's cool now"" 
 Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now 
 Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out 
 'Cause you will never get on top of this 
 So mommy best advice is just to get on top of this 
 Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh? 
 I put the pussy in a sarcophagus 
 Now she claiming that I bruise her esophagus 
 Head of the class and she just want a swallowship 
 I'm living the future so the present is my past 
 My presence is a present, kiss my ass

 Question, what do these things all have in common? 
 Everybody knows I'm a motherfucking monster 
 Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense 
 Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is 
 None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen 
 I still hear fiends scream in my dreams 
 Murder murder in black convertibles, I 
 Kill the block I murder the avenues, I 
 Rape and pillage a village, women and children 
 Everybody wanna know what my Achilles heel is? 
 Love, I don't get enough of it 
 All I get is these vampires and blood suckers 
 All I see is these niggas I've made millionnaires 
 Milling about, spilling there feelings in the air 
 All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs 
 Tryna draw blood from my ice cold veins 
 I smell a massacre 
 Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up

 Nicki Minaj: 
 Pull up in a monster automobile, gangsta 
 With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka 
 Yeah I'm in that Tonka color of Willy Wonka

 First things first I'll eat your brains 
 Then I'mma start rocking gold teeth and fangs 
 'Cause that's what a muthafucking monster do 
 Hairdresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do 
 Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe 
 Young Money is the roster and a monster crew 
 And I'm all up all up all up in the bank with the funny face 
 And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't 
 So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie? 
 But my features and my shows ten times your pay? 
 50k for a verse, no album out 
 Yeah my money's so tall that my Barbie's gotta climb it 
 Hotter than a middle eastern climate, find it 
 Tony Matterhorn dutty wine it, wine it 
 Nicki on them titties, when I sign it 
 That's how these niggas so one-track minded 
 But really, really I don't give a F-U-C-K 
 Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki, 'cause she's fake 
 She's on a diet but my pockets eating cheesecake 
 And I'll say bride of Chucky is child's play 
 Just killed another career, it's a mild day 
 Besides 'Ye, they can't stand besides me 
 I think me, you and Am should ménage Friday 
 Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash 
 I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast 
 Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for 
 Ah, I'm a motherfucking monster 
 Bon Iver: 
 I, I crossed the line, line 
 And I'll, I'll let God decide, cide

 Uh put your hands to the constellations 
 The way you look should be a sin, you my ""sin-sation"" 
 I know I'm preaching to the congregation 
 We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan 
 I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting 
 We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation 
 May the Lord forgive us, may the gods be with us 
 And that magic hour I seen good Christians 
 Make rash decisions oh she do it, 
 What happened to religion? oh she lose it 
 She putting on her make up, she casually allure 
 Text message break up, the casualty of tour 
 How she gone wake up and not love me no more 
 I thought I was the ass hole, I guess it's rubbing off 
 Hood phenomenon, the LeBron of rhyme 
 Hard to be humble when you stuntin on a jumbotron 
 I'm looking at her like ""this what you really wanted, huh?"" 
 What we argue anyway, oh I forgot its summertime 
 Uh put your hands to the constellations 
 The way you look should be a sin, you my ""sin-sation"" 
 I know I'm preaching to the congregation 
 We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan 
 I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting 
 We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation 
 When the sun go down it's the magic hour (The magic hour) 
 And outta all the colours that are still up the skies 
 You got green on your mind, I can see it in your eyes 
 Why you standing there with your face screwed up 
 Don't leave while your hot that's how Mase screwed up 
 Throwing shit around, the whole place screwed up 
 Maybe I should call Mase so that he could pray for us 
 I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat 
 I ordered you jerk, she said ""you are what you eat"" 
 You see I always loved your sense of humour 
 But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was 
 The Lyor Cohen or Dior Homme that's 
 Dior Homme not Dior homie 
 The crib scarface couldn't be more Tony 
 You love me for me could you be more phoney 
 Uh put your hands to the constellations 
 The way you look should be a sin, you my ""sin-sation"" 
 Haven't said a word, haven't said a word

 Cat got your tongue? 
 Rick Ross: 
 Lookin' at my bitch I bet she give yo ass a bone 
 Lookin' at my wrist, itta turn yo ass to stone 
 Stretch limousine, sippin rosé all alone 
 Double headed monster with a mind of its own 
 Cherry red chariot excess is just my character 
 All black tux, nigga shoes lavender 
 I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders 
 Had cyphers with yeezy before his mouth wired 
 Before his jaw shattered climbing up the lord's ladder 
 We still speeding, running signs like they don't matter 
 Hater talking never made me mad 
 Never that not when I'm in my favorite paper tag 
 Therefore G4s at the Clearport 
 When it come to tools fool I'm a Pep Boy 
 When it came to dope I was quick to export 
 Never tired of ballin' so it's on to the next sport 
 New Mercedes sedan, they'll export 
 So many cars DMV thought it was mail fraud 
 Different traps, I was gettin' mail from 
 Polk County, Jacksonville, rep Melbourne 
 Whole clique appetites had tapeworms 
 Spinnin' Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my jay burns 
 I shed a tear before the night's over 
 God bless the man I put this ice over 
 Gettin' 2Pac money twice over 
 Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice roller 
 I'm makin' love to the angel of death 
 Catchin' feelings never stumble retracin' my steps"

77,Kanye West,hiphop,Hell Of A Life,"I think I just fell in love with a porn star 
 Turn the camera on, she a born star 
 Turn the corners in a foreign car 
 Call the coroners, do the CPR 
 She gave that old nigga a ulcer 
 Her bittersweet taste made his gold teeth ache 
 Make her knees shake, make a priest faint 
 Make a nun cum, make her cremate 
 Move downtown, cop a sweet space 
 Livin' life like we won the sweepstakes, what 
 We headin to hell for heaven's sake, huh 
 Well I'mma levitate, make the devil wait, yeah

 Said her price go down, she ever fuck a black guy 
 Or do anal, or do a gangbang

 And if we run trains, we all in the same gang 
 Runaway slaves all on a chain gang

 What party is we goin' to on Oscar day 
 'Specially if she can't get that dress from Oscar de 
 La Renta, they wouldn't rent her, they couldn't take the shame

 Running my name through the mud, who's provoking you? 
 You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you 
 Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you 
 One AM and can't nobody get a hold of you 
 I'm calling your brother's phone like what was I supposed to do? 
 Even though I knew, he never told the truth 
 He was just gon' say whatever that you told him to 
 At a certain point I had to stop asking questions 
 Y'all got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers 
 I heard he bought some coke with my money 
 That ain't right girl 
 You getting blackmailed for that white girl 
 You always said, ""Yeezy, I ain't your right girl 
 You'll probably find one of them ""I like art"" type girls"" 
 All of the lights, she-was-caught-in-the-hype girl 
 And I was satisfied being in love with the lie 
 Now who to blame, you to blame, me to blame 
 For the pain and it poured every time when it rained

 ""Things used to be, now they not 
 Anything but us is who we are 
 Disguising ourselves as secret lovers 
 We've become public enemies 
 We walk away like strangers in the street 
 Gone for eternity

 With so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing?

 Hatred and attitude tear us entirely"" - Chloe Mitchell

80,Kanye West,hiphop,Who Will Survive In America,"Us living as we do upside down. 
 And the new word to have is revolution. 
 People don't even want to hear the preacher 
 Spill or spiel because God's whole card has been thoroughly piqued. 
 And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey. 
 The youngsters who were programmed to continue 
 Fucking up woke up one night digging 
 Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys. 
 America stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes. 
 The signs of Truth were tattooed across our open ended vagina. 
 We learned to our amazement untold tale of scandal. 
 Two long centuries buried in the musty vault, 
 Hosed down daily with a gagging perfume. 
 America was a bastard the illegitimate daughter of the mother country 
 Whose legs were then spread around the world 
 And a rapist known as freedom, free doom. 
 Democracy, liberty, and justice were revolutionary code names 
 That preceded the bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling

 Cannon ball of the diving board when I am bored

 Heres somthing that you can use an analogy 
 My life is like a childs solutions become reality

 When I go raw, I like to leave it in 
 When I wake up, I like to go again 
 When I go to work, she gotta call it in 
 She can't go to work, same clothes again 
 And her heart colder than the souls of men 
 Louboutin on the toes again 
 Tight dress dancin' close to him 
 Yeezus just rose again

Some day, he will open up the door for me and call my name. Some day he will. I don't know if anybody understands what that feels like.

 They don't wanna see me love you 
 They don't wanna see me love you 
 See through the veil 
 And forget all your cares 
 Throw them, throw them away 
 Oh, life's a feeling 
 Oh, the body's a feeling"
103,Kanye West,hiphop,Real Friends,"Real friends, how many of us? 
 How many of us, how many jealous? Real friends 
 It's not many of us, we smile at each other 
 But how many honest? Trust issues 
 Switched up the number, I can't be bothered 
 I cannot blame you for havin' an angle 
 I ain't got no issues, I'm just doin' my thing 
 Hope you're doin' your thing too 
 I'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions 
 Fuck the church up by drinkin' after communion 
 Spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined 
 In town for a day, what the fuck we doin'? 
 Who your real friends? We all came from the bottom 
 I'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you not the problem 
 Damn I forgot to call her, shit I thought it was Thursday 
 Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place? 
 When was the last time I remembered a birthday? 
 When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry? 
 Tell me you want your tickets when it's gametime 
 Even to call your daughter on her FaceTime 
 Even when we was young I used to make time 
 Now we be way too busy just to make time 
 Even for my... 
 Real friends 
 I guess I get what I deserve, don't I? 
 Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him 
 I guess I get what I deserve, don't I? 
 Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him 
 I couldn't tell you how old your daughter was 
 Couldn't tell you how old your son is 
 I got my own Jr. on the way, dawg 
 Plus I already got one kid 
 Couldn't tell you much about the fam though 
 I just showed up for the yams though 
 Maybe 15 minutes, took some pictures with your sister 
 Merry Christmas, then I'm finished, then it's back to business 
 You wanna ask some questions 'bout some real shit? 
 Like I ain't got enough pressure to deal with 
 Please don't pressure me with that bill shit 
 Cause everybody got 'em, that ain't children 
 Oh you've been nothin' but a friend to me 
 Niggas thinkin' I'm crazy, you defendin' me 
 It's funny I ain't spoke to niggas in centuries 
 To be honest, dawg, I ain't feelin' your energy 
 Money turn your kin into an enemy 
 Niggas ain't real as they pretend to be 
 Lookin' for all my real friends 
 How many of us? How many of us are real friends 
 To real friends, 'til the reel end 
 'Til the wheels fall off, 'til the wheels don't spin 
 To 3 A.M., callin' 
 How many real friends? 
 Just to ask you a question 
 Just to see how you was feelin' 
 How many? 
 For the last you was frontin' 
 I hate when a nigga text you like, ""what's up, fam, hope you good"" 
 You say, ""I'm good"" then great, the next text they ask you for somethin' 
 How many? 
 What's best for your family, immediate or extended 
 Any argument, the media'll extend it 
 I had a cousin that stole my laptop that I was fuckin' bitches on 
 Paid that nigga 250 thousand just to get it from him 
 Real friends 
 Huh? 
 Real friends 
 I guess I get what I deserve, don't I 
 Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him 
 I guess I get what I deserve, don't I 
 Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him"

 Thuggin', hustlin' before you met your husband? 
 Then I said, ""What if Mary was in the club 
 When she met Joseph around hella thugs? 
 Cover Nori in lambs' wool

108,Kanye West,hiphop,No More Parties In L.A.,"Let me tell you, I'm out here 
 From a very far away place 
 All for a chance to be a star 
 Nowhere seems to be too far 
 Kanye West: 
 No more parties in L.A 
 Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh 
 No more parties in L.A 
 Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh 
 No more (Los Angeles) 
 Please (shake that body, party that bod-) 
 Please (shake that body, party that body) 
 Please (shake that body, party that body) 
 Hey baby you forgot your Ray Bans 
 And my sheets still orange from your spray tan 
 Kendrick Lamar: 
 It was more than soft porn for the K-man 
 She remember my Sprinter, said ""I was in the grape van"" 
 Uhm, well cutie, I like your bougie booty 
 Come Erykah Badu me, well, let's make a movie 
 Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler 
 I show you the ropes, connect the dots 
 A country girl that love Hollywood 
 Mama used to cook red beans and rice 
 Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite 
 Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection 
 Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians 
 R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers 
 Music and iPhone cameras 
 This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think 
 That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean 
 He flew you in this motherfucker on first class 
 Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag 
 Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math? 
 That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck 
 She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper 
 I said baby, spin that round and say the alphabet backwards 
 You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence 
 Just 'cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is 
 The head still good though, the head still good though 
 Make me say ""Nam Myoho Renge Kyo"" 
 Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical 
 Make me get spiritual 
 Make me believe in miracles, Buddhist monks and Captain Crunch cereal 
 Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me 
 Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday 
 Bottle service, head service, I came in first place 
 The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek 
 The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee 
 And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets 
 Then my shoe released, she was kicking in gratuity 
 And yeah G, I was all for it 
 She said K Lamar, you kind of dumb to be a poet 
 I'mma put you on game for the lames that don't know they're a rookie 
 Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy 
 Kanye West: 
 Scary 
 Scary 
 No more parties in L.A 
 Please, baby, no more parties in L.A 
 Friday night tryna make it into the city 
 Breakneck speeds, passenger seat something pretty 
 Thinking back to how I got here in the first place 
 Second class bitches wouldn't let me on first base 
 A backpack nigga with luxury taste buds 
 And the Louis Vuitton store, got all of my pay stubs 
 Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous 
 When did I become A list? I wasn't even on a list 
 Strippers get invited to where they only get hired 
 When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired 
 I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired 
 And 3 Stacks, man, you preach it to the choir 
 Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary 
 I done got Lewinsky and paid secretaries 
 For all my niggas with babies by bitches 
 That use they kids as meal tickets 
 Not knowing the disconnect from the father 
 The next generation will be the real victims 
 I can't fault 'em really 
 I remember Amber told my boy no matter what happens she ain't going back to Philly 
 Back to our regularly scheduled programmin' 
 Of weak content and slow jammin' 
 But don't worry, this one's so jammin' 
 You know it, L.A., it's so jammin' 
 I be thinkin' every day 
 Mulholland Drive, need to put up some god damn barricades 
 I be paranoid every time 
 The pressure, the problem ain't I be drivin' 
 The problem is I be textin' 
 My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired 
 First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died 
 Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive 
 That's why I'd rather take the 405 
 I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim 
 But Saint is baby Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him 
 I had my life threatened by best friends who had selfish intents 
 What I'm supposed to do? 
 Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints? 
 Every agent I know, know I hate agents 
 I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant 
 Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance 
 It's just me, I do it my way, bitch 
 Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans 
 If I knew y'all made plans I wouldn't have popped the Xans 
 I know some fans who thought I wouldn't rap like this again 
 But the writer's block is over, emcees cancel your plans 
 A 38-year-old 8-year-old with rich nigga problems 
 Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it 
 It took 6 months to get the Maybach all matted out 
 And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out 
 God damn, got a bald fade, I might slam 
 Pink fur, got Nori dressing like Cam, thank God for me 
 Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E! 
 I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neck full 
 Bitches say he funny and disrespectful 
 I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes 
 I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news 
 I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house 
 Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out 
 We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots 
 Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop it like Robocop 
 She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that 
 She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that 
 She push me back when the dick go too deep 
 This good dick'll put your ass to sleep 
 Get money, money, money, money 
 Big, big money, money, money, money 
 And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em 
 Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker 
 I just keep on lovin' you, baby 
 And there's no one else I know who can take your place 
 Please, no more parties in L.A 
 Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh 
 No more parties in L.A 
 Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh 
 No more parties in L.A 
 Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh 
 I'm out here from a very far away place

111,Kanye West,hiphop,Saint Pablo,"Intro - Kanye West: 
 Yeah, 9: 08 L.A. time 
 Back in the lab and shit 
 Verse 1 - Kanye West: 
 My wife said, I can't say no to nobody 
 And at this rate we gon both die broke 
 Got friends that ask me for money knowing I'm in debt 
 And like my wife said, I still didn't say no 
 People tryna say I'm going crazy on Twitter 
 My friends best advice was to stay low 
 I guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills 
 Especially when you got family members on payroll 
 The media said it was outlandish spending 
 The media said he's way out of control 
 I just feel like I'm the only one not pretending 
 I'm not out of control, I'm just not in their control 
 I know I'm the most influential 
 That TIME cover was just confirmation 
 This generation's closest thing to Einstein 
 So don't worry about me, I'm fine 
 I can see a thousand years from now in real life 
 Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like 
 Grow conventional thought, don't need to question 
 I know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive 
 Thank God For Jay Electra, he down with the mission 
 Did it with with no permission, on our own conditions 
 Most Blacks with money have been beaten to submission 
 Yeezy with the big house, did it way different 
 Never listen to Hollywood producers 
 Don't stare at money too long, it's Medusa 
 The ultimate Gemini has survived 
 I wasn't supposed to make it past 25 
 Chorus - Sampha: 
 And you're looking at the church in the night sky 
 Wondering whether God's gonna say hi 
 I've been looking in the church in the night sky 
 And you wonder where is God in your nightlife 
 Yeah, you're looking at the church in the night sky 
 Father, father, father 
 Wondering whether God's gonna say hi 
 The night sky, I feel like I'm home, baby 
 Verse 2 - Kanye West: 
 I've been waking the spirits of millions more to come 
 A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums 
 I believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro 
 If the phone ringing, go and get your kids ho 
 Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation 
 He sat back and smiled 
 Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime 
 The jews share they truth on how to make a dime 
 Most black men couldn't balance a checkbook 
 But buy a new car, talking bout how my neck look? 
 Well it all looks great 
 Four hundred years later, we buying our own chains 
 The light is before us brothers, so the devil working hard 
 Real family stick together and see through the mirage 
 The smokescreens, perceptions of false reality 
 Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary? 
 I am one with the people 
 I am one with the people, real 
 I've been working from enlightened man's dream 
 Checking Instagram comments to crowdsource my self esteem 
 Let me not say too much or do too much 
 'Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch 
 I'm praying a out-of-body experience will happen 
 So the people can see my light, now it's not just rapping 
 God, I have humbled myself before the court 
 Drop my ego and confidence was my last resort 
 I know, I know he got a plan, I know I'm on your beams 
 One set of footsteps, you was carrying me 
 When I turned on the news and they was burying me 
 One set of footsteps, you was carrying me 
 When I was negotiating with Apple, it was Larry and me 
 Told Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see 
 I would've took a hundred million and gave twenty to Hov 
 I heard it's the way they did it when we only had the stove 
 But it's better that I stayed at home with my folks 
 'Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'm a never go broke 
 Only thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go 
 We all go 
 Not just by myself, looking for niggas like where's Waldo 
 She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at Aldo 
 Modern day MJ with an off the wall flow 
 Bridge - Sampha: 
 My life walk all over me 
 Walk all over me 
 I'm delivering everything I've ever sent to you, bring 
 Fly, fly, fly overseas 
 Fly overseas 
 Oh, anywhere, everything but in between 
 Chorus - Sampha: 
 Yeah, you're looking in the church in the night sky 
 Wondering whether God's gonna say hi 
 Oh, you're looking in the church in the night sky 
 And you wonder where is God in your nightlife 
 Yeah, you're looking in the church in the night sky 
 Wondering whether God's gonna say hi 
 Outro - Sampha: 
 Please face me when I speak 
 Please say to me something before you leave 
 You've been treating me like I'm invisible 
 Now I'm visible to you, oh, invisible truths 
 They say I can't quite understand what you say 
 Understand, understand 
 Understand I'm standing on the oath 
 With my hand on the book 
 Tell the truth, nothing but the whole truth 
 And you always give me half of you, half of you 
 Take half a shot, watching all my heart of gold 
 Make you feel like something from a film, oh"
112,Kanye West,hiphop,I Thought About Killing You,"I know, I know, I know, I know, know 
 I know, I know, I know, I know, know 
 I, I know it, I know it 
 The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest 
 Today I seriously thought about killing you 
 I contemplated, premeditated murder 
 And I think about killing myself, and I love myself way more than I love you, so 
 Today I thought about killing you, premeditated murder 
 You'd only care enough to kill somebody you love 
 The most beautiful thoughts are always inside the darkest 
 Just say it out loud to see how it feels 
 People say don't say this, don't say that 
 Just say it out loud to see how it feels 
 Weigh all the options, nothing's off the table 
 Today I thought about killing you, premeditated murder 
 I think about killing myself, and I love myself way more than I love you, so 
 The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest 
 I think this is the part where I'm supposed to say something good to compensate it 
 So it doesn't come off bad 
 But sometimes I think really bad things 
 Really, really, really bad things 
 And I love myself way more than I love you 
 See if I was trying to relate it to more people 
 I'd probably say I'm struggling with loving myself because that seems like a common theme 
 But that's not the case here 
 I love myself way more than I love you 
 And I think about killing myself 
 So best believe, I thought about killing you today 
 Premeditated murder 
 I called up my loved ones, I called up my cousins 
 I called up the Muslims, said I'm 'bout to go dumb 
 Get so bright it's no sun, get so loud I hear none 
 Screamed so loud got no lungs, hurt so bad I go numb 
 Time to bring in the drums, that prrt-pum-pum-pum 
 Set the Newtone on 'em, set the nuke off on 'em 
 I need coconut rum, I taste coke on her tongue 
 I don't joke with no one, they'll say he die so young 
 I done had a bad case of too many bad days 
 Got too many bad traits 
 Used the floor for ashtrays 
 I don't do shit halfway, I'ma clear the cache 
 I'ma make my name last, put that on my last name 
 It's a different type of rules that we obey 
 Ye, Ye, Ye season, nigga, we obey 
 We was all born to die, nigga DOA 
 Niggas say they hero, mhm, I don't see no cake 
 Mhm, I don't see no, mhm, yeah, I don't see no, mhm 
 If I wasn't signed to so hard there'd be no Shay 
 Buckwheat ass nigga, it's 'gon be otay 
 Young nigga shit, nigga, we don't age 
 I thought I was past my Deebo ways 
 Even when I went broke, I ain't break 
 How you gon' hate? Nigga, we go way back 
 To when I had the braids and you had the wave cap 
 Drop a pimp of the fade and I'm on my way ASAP 
 Don't get socked in the mouth, you know homie don't play that 
 Pay the fire marshal bill 'cause this shit done got way packed 
 They wanna see me go ape (ape, ape) 
 All you gotta do is speak on Ye 
 All you gotta do is speak on Ye 
 Don't get your tooth chipped like Frito-Lay"

 How are they for real, is them niggaz really paid? 
 Rappers I met, or, delt with direct 
 Is it true he won't send a beat tape until he get a check? 
 What's the position you hold? 
 Could you really master Neptunes, check my check, and ""H to the Izzo"", the only single that went gold? 
 If Roc-a-fella shit, fold, and you move back to the ""Go"" 
 Is it back to Ghost producer for D-dot on the low? 
 For the million time asking me 
 Questions like Toni Braxton, harassing me 
 Like you don't care about my son's feelings? 
 Can I get a minute, you wack bitch? I ain't gotta jack shit 
 You heard ""Takeover"", who running this rap shit? 
 Uggh, fake tits, shut up and make hits 
 Can't we all just get along, spread love, like ""take six""?

 Knowing I s'posed to style, I'm the fly boy poster child 
 Bout to beat on Oprah, now 
 It's ironic and whatnot 
 How I put no ice on the Bulgari watch, just to make it hot 
 Now you see me on stages, my hit resumes is 
 Two pages for them niggaz who played us 
 Features, raise us, booming like Master Aces 
 Stand up, number one, and there's more to come 
 All I got for hoes is hard dick and bubble gum

 So her chance of having a husband just minimize 
 That's why a lot of girls claim they ain't into guys 
 And mess with other girls part time to improvise 
 I knew she wouldn't vibrate 
 No I seen her inner eyes 
 But I'm like any other guy trying to get in her thighs 
 She telling me about how black people should enterprise 
 And I'm like, if you don't get your ass in this ride from enterprise 
 That I rented yesterday and gotta have in by 5 
 With the gas fully filled up like I didn't drive 
 Told her I had a girl, nah I didn't lie 
 Told her this rap game is all right. I'm just getting by 
 She had a lil weed and we get a lil high 
 And I'm looking in her eyes and I'm loving her vibrate 
 Told me back in 95' she fell in love with the tribe 
 Boo back in 92' I was just like you 
 Please don't be confused by the ice and jewels 
 I'm like any other guy buy ice to stay cool 
 Like any other kid that claim they hate school 
 And think yeah Free's banging but she's no Rachel. 
 We ball till we fall 
 Hit the mall 
 After we 
 Hit don't call 
 We fill your lives 
 With nothing but lies 
 And I would like to 
 Apologize. 
 But you can't stand right here 
 And tell me everything is going to be all right 
 'Cause until the day a real man stands up 
 I'm going to have to improvise. 
 Was it something I did wrong? 
 Yeah I know I'm wrong 
 She's at home alone and I'm always gone 
 Hate it when she mad but more when she passive 
 Now she on the internet looking for classes 
 Out of state though, man that hurt yo 
 But I got work though, and I'm at work yo 
 And she don't call a lot 
 And when she do she pouring out her heart 
 You never listen to me then the call drop hmm 
 And I promised her everything 
 Told her when I get a deal I'll get her a wedding ring 
 But when I got my deal I was back in the ring 
 Fighting my urges, strip club splurges 
 Never had money so I feel like a virgin 
 And I'm trying to break the bank's cherry 
 Trying to see can I afford Canaries 
 With a Ferrari, and a dinner date with Halle Berry? 
 When from 50 g's to fifteen hundred in a week 
 No I'm trying to call... one ring... two rings... seven rings... eight rings 
 Her mother picked up the phone 
 Like she in school and she don't stay here no more 
 I guess there's more good women than men percentage wise 
 So her chance of having a husband just minimize 
 I guess that's why she says she ain't into guys 
 And focus on school full-time to improvise. 
 No no, you can't stand right here 
 And tell me everything is gonna be all right 
 'Cause until that real man stands up 
 I'm going to have to improvise. [x3]"

 Rock-Dawg, Gold Force, Baggy style 
 I kept her number on file 
 For my girl be actin' wyld

 You wanna know why? I mean you know why 
 How on the low I push jet-skee's so I 
 Couldn't return them pages, on my motorolla 
 Nextel, my cell it don't work down there 
 And what happened in cancun, stay down there 
 What's happenin' here, made me wish I stayed down there 
 Take a seat. Why you always makin' a beef? 
 You know these walls too thin in this apart-a-meant 
 Now everybody hearin our arguments 
 What the problem is?!?!?

 Waiting on a dream that'll never come true 
 Didn't you know I was waiting on you?

 When you decide to break the rules

 People will talk like it's old news

 Let me ask you how long have you known too? 
 You played it off and act like he's brand new

 Backing drums by DJ Premier 
 Now let me count it down, who the f-ck up in here 
 Common, Don, Old G, battle rap, oh 
 That n-ggas know you can't really f-ck with that 
 Pusha T, the Clipse just made a classic 
 Good music together we too Jurassic, you stay plastic 
 Ramadan with the flow, guaranteed everyone fasting 
 Big Sean is a don 
 Cyhi da Prince 
 Why you so nervous dog stop being tense 
 If you ain't talking bout Rash we ain't got nothing in common 
 F-ck that and that's just common sense what the

 Came in the game, 8 years prior 
 8 years later, your man's on fire 
 My Book of Eli, to all my subscribers 
 Play the two doors, street car named desire 
 Came in Grindin', Ye' came throught the wire 
 But at the crossroads, Bone thugs inspired 
 1st of the month, Trump to the buyers 
 Rent too paid on the coupe you been fired 
 Smooth criminal, no prior's 
 Man in the mirror, check no liar 
 Still like that butterfly like Mariah 
 Show me the money the black Jerry MaGuire 
 Tom Cruise on that couch if that money right 
 West Hollywood feels like a bunny night 
 With GOOD company and better jewelers 
 To the Good Life, we GOOD music 
 (Big Sean) 
 Man, I wake up to a wet dream 
 Every day's a Friday and every nights a sex scene 
 Every week is fashion week and every day I'm pressed clean 
 Detroit's Angel, I even got red wings 
 I'm headed to the ball, me and three prom queens 
 My life's prom night and guess who's the Prom King 
 They having a kissing fight and I'm Don King 
 Everybody know I'm coming soon like LeBron's ring 
 I'm Big L, Notorious, Big Pun, Shawn Carter, Sean Combs and Connery all in one 
 Whoever told you sky's the limit is looking dumb 
 'Cause I'm 22 and I'm moonwalking on the sun 
 Oh that's your girl 
 She feelin' on my water right next to a couple boaters 
 And she tryna motor boat her and I'm coming from the w-w-westside of the Motor 
 You might find banana clips 'cause it's Guerilla warfare 
 Last year I was watching this from the couch and now I'm here 
 That's to let you know what I'm about 
 Reaper black suit 'cause my whole team's killing 
 Had to keep setting trends 'cause your whole team stealin 
 Many tell me I'm the man I ain't made it yet 
 Tell me who the baddest, I'll see if I see them naked yet 
 Won't stop till I get that Mercedes 700 CLK and Mercedes ain't made it yet 
 (Cyhi Da Prince) 
 I'm Mr Got bread like Quizno's 
 Better known as MJ with the big nose 
 I swear your artist couldn't see me on his tip toes 
 Only on TV I gotta take a quick pose 
 Let me stop I forgot this was a big show 
 And being dope made you broke I ain't piss poor 
 I'm big poppa plus I'm 2pacalypto 
 My mind is a weapon what I need to pop a clip for 
 Huh, I'm doing this for hip hop 
 I'm coming after you, him and his spot 
 Still tied to the streets like a ish knot 
 Ain't nothing fake, I'm not a Rolly with a tick tock 
 Atlanta repper in the home of the yankees 
 Rose wood suit on with the hanky 
 I got rich from the zones of the stanky 
 So everybody know my money long, lanky! 
 So I'm flexible stretching out my decimel's 
 Switching up the flow got the crowd going testicles 
 Can't bleep it out 'cause there wasn't nothing sexual 
 I'm blowing loud, somebody check the decibels 
 I'm impeccable they put me on the pedestal 
 And if you bite me, it's good for you like a vegatable 
 Shows by the several, schedule full of festivals 
 And if I ever do time than you know its federal 
 Uh, incredible, yeah 
 (Common) 
 F-f-fam fam fam I'ma monster too 
 You don't see I do things that the monsters do 
 The incomparable, remarkable, articles 
 About my audio technique, my technique 
 I recognise games like the ESPY's 
 Cold to myself I say God Bless me the truth 
 So I speak live and directly 
 You, I will set free my mic is where my check be 
 Rah, I echo, I echo, I echo, the sounds of the ghetto, future of the retro 
 Prolly in the metro just so I can get dough 
 The name is Common but the frame is special 
 Leave requested from the years I've invested 
 Arrested, develop, addressed it, envelope 
 The body of the black party from Farley to Bob Marley 
 Go home or go hard, at home is life hardly 
 (Kanye West) 
 The plan was to drink till the pain over 
 What's worse, the pain or the hangover? 
 Fresh air rolling down the window 
 Too many urkels on your team that's why your Winslow 
 I sold my soul to the devil that's a crappy deal 
 Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal 
 This game you could never win 
 'Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again 
 Get away from me loniless 
 Get away from me misery 
 Get away from me fake sh-t, I can't take the phoniness 
 Get away from me wack tracks 
 I can only make only hits 
 I'm an only child lost in the World 
 Where did the lonely kids go when the bell ring 
 Feeling like hell rings 
 Bringing me back down 
 Checking my background 
 Its ironic what's happening 
 Imagine if I didn't have the ends 
 I would'nt have so many imaginary friends 
 I'm spaced out Dog, I be on that Moon talk 
 Wonder if God ask Mike how to moon walk 
 I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more 
 That's that vision around the time I was a sophomore 
 I guess everything I hate about me I see in him 
 And I ain't finna change, so we'll never agree again 
 Just a few things pouring out my soul 
 Rosewood we could see her with our eyes closed"

 Please, you're Amateur Night, it's Showtime 
 It's one life to live, so live it the best you can 
 The world could use one less man 
 Not enough air, not enough car factories 
 To manufacture new vehicles, sedans and vans 
 When they do make the whip you like 
 Your chips ain't right 
 By the time you could afford it 
 The car ain't imported 
 In the streets I'm in, it's just iron 
 Cops keep firin', in my environment 
 Leavin' you slumped, then they drive home 
 Far from the hood, brothers they eager to jump on 
 I like to be the wall that they toast up on 
 I like to see them fall, guilty for doin' wrong

 (Verse Three: KRS-One) 
 How many of y'all got - 'Criminal Minded'? 
 You, you, you, y'all don't be blinded 
 Me - I got no jewels on my neck 
 Why? - I don't need 'em, I got your respect 
 KRS-One, 20 years I rock 
 I do it for JMJ and Scott La Rock 
 This hip-hop and we's a nation 
 Don't you wanna hear more KRS on your radio station? 
 Instead of broadcasting how we smoke them trees 
 On the radio we need to hear more local emcees 
 Where you at?, c'mon where you at? 
 This is the difference between emceein' and rappin' 
 Rappers spit rhymes that're mostly illegal 
 Emcees spit rhymes to uplift their people 
 Peace, Love, Unity, havin' fun 
 These are the lyrics of KRS-One... 
 (Hook: Samples) 
 (Rakim Sample) 
 ""I'm Rakim, the fiend of a microphone.."" 
 (Verse Four: Rakim) 
 Uh, yeah, is y'all ready for 20-07? 
 It's now another drought 
 Everybody's a killer, wow we buggin' out 
 Since '86 showin' the crowd what I'm about 
 And they still wanna know when the album comin' out 
 Ask the teenagers, OG's and ask the kids 
 What their definition of Classic is? 
 Timeless, so age don't count in the booth 
 When your flow stay submerged in the fountain of youth 
 Ain't no doubtin' the truth, I'm off the meters 
 Everybody cosignin', even non-believers 
 Since I came in the door, and became one of y'all leaders 
 In a fresh pair Air Force sneakers 
 Uptowns, we call 'em uppies, when they're on divas 
 Probably worn when KRS-One teaches 
 Nas - Made You Look, before the heaters 
 I bet Kan' had 'em on when he walked with Jesus

130,Kanye West,hiphop,Better Than Yours,"(Featuring Common) 
 My raps is better than yours 
 My plaques is better than yours 
 My tracks is better than yours 
 You can have one but I have to charge 
 We can start with the hits on my arm I already got the bomb 
 Now all I need is my first LP to go gold 
 Then I will have the Kwam uh-uh uh-uh uh-uh 
 I'm Kon the Louis Vuitton Don 
 Bought my Mom a purse now she Louis Vuitton Mom 
 Still might throw on a little low arm they want me to stop go on gon 
 They don't want me to shop and me spending that hard 
 Oh my God is that a black card 
 I turned around and replied why yes 
 But I prefer the term African American Express 
 La La La La La Off MTV 
 La La La La La When you gonna go out with Me 
 Brains Power and Muscle like Dame Puffy and Russell 
 Your boy back on his hustle don't know you don't discuss you 
 Every rapper want to know when they can get to work 
 Every stylist want to know where they can get the shirts 
 Everybody ripping my style like the shit that hurts 
 But they don't give me my credit that's the shit that hurts 
 There's something I might say There's something I might play 
 A beat I might made might make they life change 
 And save they whole deal They wrist is on chill 
 They house is on hill You could be Lauren Hill 
 See y'all write songs to keep the lights on 
 I'ma go in Def Jam and turn the brights on 
 Man I'm just sayin' 
 When I wanted to rap y'all thought I was just playin' 
 Now you just prayin' 
 (Common) 
 You was a vic in high school now you a thug 
 Better step in the name of love 
 Before you giving pain a hug 
 Needing dope is like pain to drugs 
 Or aiming slugs till the game unplugged 
 Like a scoreboard with vice and warlords 
 Hot merchandise prices they want more for it 
 You was pink as ice single need to think it twice 
 Over the bitch and you came out like freaks in the night 
 Freed your mind at a cheaper price on the street trying to seek advice 
 I'm on point like I speak to dice 
 Took the underground at a steeper heights 
 May real niggaz see the light got fat girls eating right 
 Ha ha we in this bitch 
 It's Common and Kanye y'all niggaz know what time it is 
 Chi-Town motherfuckers DJ Ferris Heavy Hitters What Up? 
 Mike Love What Up? DJ Enuff 
 Foreal (Pharrell) That's my favorite producer by the way 
 That's why I had to rap on this 'Cause 
 His tracks is Better Than Yours

 Just Blaze tracks is Better Than Yours 
 You can have one but we all gonna

 Your stress and you're my masseuse, 
 Mama say mama say momma Dondas' son, 
 Lost in this plastic life,

 We'll still get laid in the after-life, 
 If we die in each others arms we'll still get laid.

 (Chorus) my chain heavy yeah yeah my chain heavy, my chain heavy, my chain too heavy (repeat 2x) 
 They try to tell me my chain broke the levy, 
 Maybe 'cause its flooded, 
 Why you walkin' round with a baby cross his cousin, 
 My teeth already white y'all gone make me floss for nothing, 
 My teeth real diamonds what's the cause of the frontin', 
 While y'all got all caps on?, 
 Don Cheadle Time, 
 Get extra black on em', 
 Burn Hollywood burn, 
 Take too long for n****** to get their turn, 
 Probably be cremated before I get my urn, 
 They try to tell that aliens built the pyramids, 
 I swear life's a bitch on a period, 
 For every inch they cut the nose off the Sphinx, 
 I made my jeweler add a few mo links, 
 You can look at me and tell I don't care what nobody think, 
 And my face always lookin' like somebody stink. 
 (Chorus) my chain heavy yeah yeah my chain heavy, my chain heavy, my chain too heavy (repeat 2x) 
 Here we go, like we should, 
 Feel the sweat, on ya face, 
 Here we go, like we should, 
 Feel the sweat, on ya face, 
 All right okay, feel the sweat on ya face, h 
 Ere we go, like we should, like we should, like we should 
 What color was the skin that bared the cross, 
 No matter how many lashes they couldn't beat it off, 
 How many caskets will we see in one lifetime?, 
 That's why Miles Davis coping is mic time, 
 I keep that notebook on my ottoman, 
 And wrote hooks about slaves that was slaughtered in the 1800's, 
 Y'all forget that I got called nigger on Twitter so many times, 
 Man I lived that, 
 Man I'm just trying to find out where to raise my kids at, 
 'Cause they don't want n****** where they crib at, 
 Hey real tom lookin' for a nice park, 
 Twelve noon she say my family gone make it too dark, 
 This is the flow that solar eclipses, 
 So hopefully one day that real soul will eclipse the bullshit, they got us listenin' to, 
 In this existence, 
 Don't give up now just a little mo persistence, 
 I want to thank Ice Cube and Michael Jackson (?), 
 Keep 'em away huh, something might happen, 
 This is the making of a masterpiece, so we broke out the chains and told the master peace."

 Damn, look at all the bad b-tches I gave you 
 Man I can see the flaws to your flavour 
 Look like wonder woman and still need a saviour 
 Maybe it's a billionaire maybe it's the cocaine 
 I done seen drugs and money run the whole game 
 A good girl lost in the city life 
 Agent Provocateur holding titties right 
 I'm haute couture of hoes galore 
 Give my girl a Newport 'cause she's smoking yours 
 I'm the authority of model seniority 
 They call me Les but they all need more of me.

 Stuff all my problems in that bong and I'm puffin' strong 
 I been locked in my way of thinking, now my cuffs are gone 
 Must've been the liquor talkin', I'm beggin' the cups, ""C'mon"" 
 Might come off as irregular, I come in custom form

 My sound's full-grown, reminds me of my favorite chronic (Kush) 
 Ball like a SuperSonic, make the haters vomit (Uh) 
 Nigga, make some money 'fore you make a comment 
 I meant to snap a while ago, but who knows where the time went? 
 Prolly dime chicks, whips with a Diddy

 They don't really know what's in my air fucking with me 
 How can I be better? 
 I could start with just the basics 
 Dior, Dior, galore, I love the cut 
 I seem to have forgotten that I'm off the nini 
 To the people who don't know Cud', know what? 
 Rose gold presidential on my boney wrist 
 Took my ma to Chanel, had her LC the stunner 
 She got haters, some in the fam made us 
 But they don't really matter, we escape 'em with our paper 
 ""Hey ya"", I'm on my Andre 3000 
 I'm all good now, a n-gga don't need no counseling 
 Woke up in the room and my mojo was active 
 Looks from the hoes that were more than likely passive 
 Back when let me not reflect on the old sh-t 
 I'm on to the new act, on to my new script 
 B-tches better have they thoughts before approaching 
 I done heard it all, baby, save it for them other n-ggas 
 Do things all before living, haters, copy, I'm the image 
 Haters, copy, I'm the image"

 And I'm, so happy I'm with my baby 
 And we a lil late with the Christmas gifts 
 Rushing for the mall, don't trip, you know I drive crazy 
 The streets lit up, it feel like Christmas officially 
 Told her that ""You the star at the top of my Christmas tree"" 
 My only question is, ""Where my presents?"" 
 She said, ""Shhh,"" she got a gift for me that ain't for the kids to see 
 Well, I like the way you think, mami 
 Now pour some more eggnog in you drink, mami 
 Got a surprise for you that ain't on your Christmas list-es 
 Gave her the hot chocolate, she said ""It's D-ricious""

 Ha, I swear I got the freshest wardrobe 
 I let my beard grow 'cause it's cold in the North Pole 
 Her voice slow 'cause ""I always got a sore throat"" 
 Okay, stop it, no more jokes 
 You never see me 'cause I shop when the stores close 
 And my sleigh go faster than the Porsche go 
 Ha, I got nine reindeers 
 That's Dancer, that's Prancer on the fourth flo' 
 That's Comet, that's Cupid, that's Vixen 
 That's Donner, that's Dasher, that's Blitzen 
 Happy kwanzaa, and for the ones that aren't Christian 
 Everybody gets gifts as long as I'm living 
 So look forward to having

 Christmas in Harlem 
 Right after autumn falls 
 Soaking it all in 
 Then we go hit the mall 
 Even though we ain't balling 
 Feels like we bought it all 
 The mistletoe's right here 
 Come give a kiss to Santa Claus 
 All the flashing lights up on a tree 
 The house lit up nice 
 With your family's where you wanna be 
 Here on Christmas night 
 When you wake up and you see the gifts 
 Don't that make you feel good? 
 So since we all snowed in in Harlem 
 Let's have Christmas in the hoo-hood 
 All of the flashing lights 
 Yeah, when they shine so bright 
 Always for you and me 
 Baby, you're Christmas Eve 
 If you like what you see me 
 Won't you come sit on my knee? 
 Tell me everything that you want 
 Cause, baby, I'm your Santa Claus 
 Christmas in Harlem 
 Right after autumn falls 
 Soaking it all in 
 Then we go hit the mall 
 Even though we ain't balling 
 Feels like we bought it all 
 The mistletoe's right here 
 Come give a kiss to Santa Claus 
 (Kanye West) 
 I peeped it, you know what? 
 Need some reindeer for this one 
 I wanna hear sleigh bells on this one 
 Got a new suit on this one 
 The newborn look too cute for this one 
 Yeah, the new winter coat for this one 
 Yeah, gotta let it snow on this one 
 Huh, all the Christmas cheer for this one 
 The whole family up in here on this one 
 Yeah 
 (Teyana Taylor - Chorus) 
 Christmas in Harlem 
 Right after autumn falls 
 Soaking it all in

 And now for my next number, 
 I'd like to return to the cl- 
 To the cl- 
 To the classics (Classics) 
 (Timeless) 
 (Classic) 
 (I'm better than I've ever been, timeless) 
 Rakim, the fiend of the microphone 
 (Rakim) 
 Is y'all ready for Twenty-0-7, it's now another drought 
 Everyone's a killer, wow we buggin' out 
 Since '86 showin' the crowd what I'm about 
 And they still want to know when the album comin' out 
 Ask the teenagers, OGs and ask the kids 
 What they definition of classic is 
 Timeless, so age don't count in the booth 
 When your flow stays submerged in the fountain of youth 
 Ain't no doubtin' the truth I'm off the meters 
 Everybody co-signing even non-believers 
 Since I came in the door, became one of y'alls leaders 
 In the fresh pair of Air Force One sneakers 
 Uptown we call 'em uppies when they on divas 
 Prolly want what KRS-One teaches 
 Nas, made you look, before the haters 
 I bet you Kan had 'em on when he walked with Jesus 
 This is 
 Classic 
 I'm better than I've ever been 
 Timeless 
 I'm everywhere you've never been and better than I've ever been 
 Classic 
 I'm better than I've ever been 
 Timeless 
 (I-I-I'd like to return to the classics) 
 (Kanye West) 
 Kan-Kanye West 
 Can't buy this, superflyness, like a shyness, your highness 
 It's performin', look how long the line is 
 That's what happens when you make shit that's timeless 
 That's what happens these rappers is the pioneers 
 What do it take to be a legend like Nas is? 
 That's so novice, I'm so polished 
 I got a right to be a little bit snobbish 
 I did a little bit of college 
 Semesters it took 2 like Rob Base 
 To let me figure out this wasn't my place 
 The beat slowed till you listened to my pace 
 'Cause I be killin' shit, but that's evident 
 And y'all feelin' it, but I expected it 
 If it's classic it's gonna last forever than I'm everywhere you never been and better than I ever been 
 Classic 
 I'm better than I've ever been 
 Timeless 
 I'm everywhere you've never been and better than I've ever been 
 Classic 
 I'm better than I've ever been 
 Timeless 
 (All of 4th town represent to the fullest Nas and Rockwell) 
 Nas: 
 Perseverance, see the fake hustler rapper 
 To them it hurts to hear this 
 Oh you went platinum - yeah that's nice 
 Now let me see you do the same thing twice 
 3 times, 4 times, then been a couple of more times 
 Please your amateur night is show time 
 It's one life to live so live it the best you can 
 The world could use one less man 
 Not enough air 
 Not enough car factories to manufacture new vehicles sedans and vans 
 When they do make the whip you like ya chips ain't right 
 By the time you could afford it the car ain't important 
 In the streets silent, it's just I and - cops keep firin' (pow, pow, pow) in my environment 
 Leavin' you slump when they drive home far from the hood brothers they eager to jump on 
 I'd like to be the wall that they toast up on 
 I'd like to see them fall, guilty for doing wrong 
 I'm classic like the Air Ones, the Hustler shoe, that's what I'm accustomed to 
 Classic 
 I'm better than I've ever been 
 Timeless 
 I'm everywhere you've never been and better than I've ever been 
 Classic 
 I'm better than I've ever been 
 Timeless

 KRS-One: 
 (Of course we have, blast-master KRS-One) 
 How many y'all got criminal minded 
 You, you, you, y'all don't be blinded 
 Me, I got no jewels on my neck 
 Why? I don't need 'em I got your respect 
 KRS-One 20 years I rock I do it for JMJ and Scott LaRock this hip hop 
 And we's a nation, don't you want to hear more KRS on your radio station? 
 Instead of broadcasting how we smokin' trees 
 On the radio we need to hear more local MC's 
 Where you at? Come on where you at? 
 This is the difference between MC'ing and rap 
 Rappers spit rhymes that are mostly illegal 
 MC's spit rhymes to uplift they people 
 Peace, love, unity, havin' fun, these are the lyrics of KRS-One

 Can't a young nigga get money anymore? 
 Tell PETA my mink is draggin' on the floor 
 Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws 
 Come to meet me without no drawers? 
 Dinner with Anna Wintour, racin' wit' Anja Rubik 
 I told you muthafuckas it was more than the music 
 In the projects one day to 
 Project Runway 
 We done heard all that loud ass talkin', we used to it 
 I'm from where shorties fucked up, double-cupped up 
 Might even kill somebody and YouTube it 
 So whoever think they words affect me is too stupid 
 And if you could do it better than me, then you do it 
 We flyer than the parakeet, floatin' wit' no parachute 
 Six thousand dollar pair of shoes, we made it to the Paris news! 
 Don't talk about style, 'cause I embarrass you 
 Shut the fuck up when you talk to me 'fore I embarrass you 
 Can't a young nigga get money anymore? 
 Tell PETA my mink is draggin' on the floor 
 Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws 
 Come to meet me without no drawers? 
 And the whole industry wanna fuck yo' old chick 
 Only nigga I got respect for is Wiz 
 And I'll admit, I fell in love with Kim 
 'Round the same time she had fell in love wit' him 
 Well, that's cool, baby girl, do ya thing 
 Lucky I ain't have Jay drop 'im from the team

 Shut the fuck up when you talk to me 'fore I embarrassed you 
 GOOD Music, we fresh, we fresh 
 Anything else, we detest, detest 
 Bitch-ass niggas got ass and breasts

 Can't a young nigga get money anymore?

 Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws 
 Come to meet me without... 
 Don't talk to me 'bout style, nigga, I'll muthafuckin' embarrass you

140,Kanye West,hiphop,Corners,"Feat. Kanye West, The Lost Prophets 
 Verse 1:(Common) 
 Memories on corners with the fo's and the mo's 
 Walk to the store for the rose, talking straightforward to hoes 
 Got uncles that smoke, and some put blow up they nose 
 To cope with the lows, the wind is cold and it blows 
 In they socks and they soles, niggaz holdin' they rolls 
 Corners leave souls opened and closed, hopin' for mo' 
 We know where to go, niggaz rollin' in droves 
 They shoot the wrong way, 'cause they ain't know and they goes 
 The streets ain't safe 'cause they ain't knowing the code 
 By the foes I was told, either focus or fold 
 Got cousins with flows, hope they open some doors 
 So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls 
 Now I roll in a Olds, with windows that don't roll 
 Down the roads where cars get broken and stole 
 These are the stories told by Stony and Cottage Grove 
 The world is cold, the block is hot as a stove 
 On the corners 
 (Kanye West) 
 I wish I could give you this feelin' 
 I wish I could give this feelin' 
 On the corners niggaz rob or kill 
 And dyin' just to make a livin', huh? 
 (Spoken: Lost Prophets) 
 We overstated, we underrated, we educated 
 The corner was our time when time stood still and 
 Gators and snakeskins and 
 Yellow and pink and 
 ? Profiles ?? 
 Verse 2: (Common) 
 Street lights and deep nights, cats tryin' to eat right 
 Ridin' no-seat-bikes, with work to feed hypes 
 So they can get sweet Nike's, they head and they feet right 
 Desires of street life, cars and weed types 
 Its hard to breathe nights, days are thief-like 
 The beasts roam the streets, the police is Greek-like 
 Game that is deep, we speak and believe hype 
 Banged in the streets has cop left for deep life (?) 
 Its steep life, coming up where niggaz is sheep-like 
 Rappers and hoopers, we strive to be like 
 G's with three strikes, seeds that need light 
 Cheese and recite, needs and BE strife 
 The corner, where struggle and greed fight 
 We write songs about wrong 'cause its hard to see right 
 Look to the sky, hoping it will bleed light 
 Reality's a bitch, and I heard that she bites 
 The corner 
 (Spoken: Lost Prophets) 
 The corner was our magic, our music, our politics 
 Fires raised as tribal dances and war cries 
 Broke out on different corners 
 Power to the people 
 Black power 
 Black is beautiful 
 Verse 3: (Common) 
 Black church services, murderers, Arabs serving burgers 
 As cats with gold permanents, move they bags as herbalists 
 The dirt isn't just fertile, its people workin' and earnin' this 
 The curb getters go where the cats flow and the current is 
 It's so hot that niggaz burn to live 
 The furnace is, whether money movin', the determined live 
 We talk shit, play lotto, and buy German beers 
 It's so black packed with action that's affirmative 
 The corners 
 (Spoken: Lost Prophets) 
 The corner was our Rock of Gibraltar, our Stonehenge 
 Our Taj Mahal, our monument 
 Our testimonial to freedom, to peace, and to love 
 Down on the corner"

 Don't look down, it's an impossible view 
 Fly like an eagle, whatever you do 
 Don't look down, it's an impossible view 
 Spread your wings, aerial 
 (Lupe Fiasco) 
 Head to the sky, wings raised in 
 She's about to fly and take her place in 
 Out there in the stars, when she leaves the ground 
 She'll see a broken heart, if she turns around 
 But ain't no going back, this is how it must be 
 He told her, she'll be burned alive 
 She just told him trust me 
 If funerals are beautiful, this ugly 
 Knowing she told her you'll leave me if you loved me 
 And he knows that, because he knows her 
 Hard to hide his feeling's as it engulfs her 
 Now she's a bright blaze, light rays 
 A shooting out Phoenix on fire buring up the night scape 
 So lets hear it for our heroine, applaud as our spirits fly into the never end 
 One closed chapter, it opens up another part 
 So this is more like, the end, question mark (question mark, question mark)

 Don't let me hold you back 
 I only hold you back 
 We on a dead-end street, this block has got a cul-de-sac 
 So fly baby, my baby, so high, sometimes it's so hard to say bye 
 We made it from the alley straight up to ballet 
 We pulled up to the valet, we'll teach our daughter ballet 
 We'll raise us a Beyonce, maybe she'll be a Halle 
 You woulda been the best mom 
 I would have been the best 'Ye

 I know that's very gross but we getting very close 
 To our end, though I killed most with a pen

 No baby, me go 
 You got my heart 
 Baby this what it be for 
 I give it all as far as my feet go 
 What do you mean, me go 
 Why can't it be, we go 
 What happens when people turn to tears 
 Dreams turn to memories 
 And weeks turn to years 
 Huh? standing in the same spot for a couple of weeks 
 Give me my feelings back, wish it came with a couple receipts 
 Man, our vacation was coming next week 
 Girl I swear you was a trip, lets make it a couples retreat (do it) 
 How cud my girl do this to me 
 Woke up sayin' no, the World did this to me 
 Now I'm testing one two 
 Reportin live from the rubble 
 Drinking all I can so I can turn to fire when I hug you 
 One, two, three, four, five models on the double 
 Give me head all at once look like they line in a huddle 
 But it's not even half the feeling as hearing you shine 
 She know I love ya, shedding tears everyday 
 And I'm tired of lying in these puddles 
 I ask ""Y"" sometimes like a f-cking vowel 
 But hitting tree's everyday like a f-cking owl 
 Trying to get high enough to cut the clouds 
 Caught the Phoenix Sun to Nash it out, I mean ash it out. 
 So I could see you smile 
 I-I know you can see me now

 For you faggot ass niggas that like to front

 In the kitchen with the heat making beats in my apron 
 You hating and you want to erase it 
 Close your eyes when you know you can't take it

 I Rolls Royce it on a regular basis 
 You talk street shit it sound like sweet shit 
 Straight liquorice you niggas sound ticklish 
 80k large for the Hermes dream

 My policy's not to be dishonestly deprived 
 So gimme that, gimme that, keep going 
 Where my city at, I'm like steak and fries but never die 
 They wanna Ghostface wanna be me 
 But they will post haste follow me into the after life 
 That means you going right after I've 
 But I'm the hero sort of like Jack Sparrow 
 So someway somehow I have survived 
 Ha ha surprised

 There's hoes in magazines you lame sayin' you lame 
 And for the hate in advance, pull down your pants 
 Make 'em kiss both cheeks like we living in France

 Popped too many corks to let you dork's offend me

 And we get the session pumpin 
 See I came back for you 
 'Cause any rap chick dat look half nice 
 I'm givin' 'em half price 
 Back when eve went with steve 
 Before she had a weave 
 I was sendin her beat tapes like you wouldn't believe 
 Back when foxy had a group with nas and az 
 Da way she looked on chyna doll 
 I wouldve did dem beats for free 
 'Cause only recently I been gettin' a visa fee 
 Da checks I got from d dot was steady teasin me 
 I got some earrings he gave me they may be fake 
 But at least its got girls callin me babycake 
 Now maybe kay can have a manaj with lazy kay 
 And lady may maybe hey 
 You lookin' all thick and sweet 
 You need a n*gga that can give you dick and beats 
 So go and get angie and tell her 
 I came back for you 
 To show you that I'm workin with a little somethin' 
 And we get the session pumpin 
 See I came back for you 
 'Cause any rap chick dat look half nice 
 I'm givin' 'em half price 
 (Kanye talkin') 
 Right now I gotta 2 for head sale 
 Send send headshots first tho 
 Beat tapes for who 
 Oh trina I'm right there I'm right there 
 I'll be at the studio in five minutes 
 Yeah yeah she said she wanna ass look 
 Could she wear 
 I told her all I needed was my back end checked 
 I told her"
146,Kanye West,hiphop,Drive Slow (Remix),"(Kanye West) 
 My homie Mali used to stay, 79th and May 
 One of my best friends from back in the day 
 Down the street from Calumet, a school full of Stones 
 He nicknamed me K-Rock so they'll leave me alone 
 Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off 
 And walked around the mall with his radio face off 
 Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand, keys in his hand 
 Reason again to let you know he's the man 
 Back when we rocked Alieses, he had dreams of Caprices 
 Drove by the teachers, even more by polices 
 How he get the cash the day his father passed away 
 Left him with a lil somethin', 16 he was stuntin' 
 ""Al B. Sure"" nigga with the hair all wavy 
 Hit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy 
 Hit the freeway, go at least bout 80 
 Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby 
 See back back then then if you had a car 
 You was the Chi-Town version of Baby 
 And I was just a virgin, a baby 
 One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy 
 I used to love play my demo tape when the system yanked 
 Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked 
 We'll take a Saturday and just circle the mall 
 They had they Lincoln's and Aurora's, we was hurtin' 'em all 
 With the girls alot of flirtin' involved but dog... 
 Fuck all that flirtin', I'm tryin' to get in some drawers, so 
 Put me on with these hoes homie 
 He told me, ""Don't rush to get grown, drive slow homie"" 
 (Chorus: Kanye West) 
 Drive slow, homie 
 (Drive slow) 
 You never know, homie 
 About these hoes homie 
 You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie 
 (Verse 2: Paul Wall) 
 What it do? 
 I'm posted up in the parking lot, my trunk wavin 
 The candy gloss is immaculate, its simply amazing 
 Them elbows pokin wide on that candy 'Lac 
 Trunk open, screens on, neon's lit with 5th relaxed 
 I'm on a mission for dime pieces and sexy ladies 
 Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes 
 It's a star-studded event when I valet park 
 Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark 
 You see them 4's crawlin, you see them screens fallin' 
 The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin' 
 I'm leanin on the switch, sittin' crooked in my slab 
 But I could still catches boppers if I drove a cab 
 A young Houston hard-hitter all about the scrilla 
 Ridin' somethin' candy-coated crawlin' like a caterpillar 
 I'm tippin' on them 4's, I'm jammin' on that Screw 
 I'm lookin' for them hoes baby, what it do 
 [Chorus: Kanye West] (GLC) 
 Drive slow, homie 
 (Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes) 
 Drive slow, homie 
 (If you ridin' around the city with nowhere to go) 
 Drive slow, homie 
 (Live today, cause tomorrow man, you never know) 
 You never know, homie 
 Might meet some hoes, homie 
 You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie 
 (Kanye West) 
 My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib 
 I got mo TV's in here than where I live 
 (GLC) 
 And that don't make no sense, but baby I'm the shit 
 And everything I flip, you know it's somethin' serious 
 I got the custom grill, I got the Bravis rims 
 I got the baller genetics baby this evidence 
 You see a player flickin', and how you ain't convinced 
 That you should go on and kiss it, just a lil bit (just a lil bit) 
 I wearin my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain 
 My canary's is gleamin', through my angel wings 
 They see me, hoes actin' like they seen a king 
 With that mean lean, smokin' on that finest Cali green 
 My woodgrain oak, I'm ridin' on Vogues 
 My cylinder quiet, like tip-toes 
 I sold O's, and this I know 
 When you see them hoes, lil homie drive slow *echoes* 
 (Tony Williams harmony ad-libs) 
 (T.I.) 
 Lookin' at the life through my rearview, all the problems I had 
 Could be seen alot clearer after time had passed 
 Known for livin' so fast, they wonder how he don't crash 
 With 220 on the dash, he constantly mashin' 
 (Why don't he slow down?) They be constantly askin' 
 But me in the fast lane is like metal and magnets 
 Now I ain't tryna say that it's the way of the masses 
 But it, so hard to change, I love this shit with a passion 
 Since me and Sigel cuttin' classes, showin' our ass 
 Shootin' out in broad day in the middle of traffic 
 I remember sellin' crack faster than I could bag it 
 Just sharing my pass with you shorty, I ain't braggin' 
 Me and Cap got life, some other folk got blasted 
 Had a partner OD'd and after this all happened 
 It's like the only thing that kept a pimp from cryin' and laughin' 
 And the Lord smiled on me at the end of the madness 
 I never thought that I'd make it this far rappin' 
 For introducin' the youth to what we now call trappin' 
 Considered now a classic, who'da imagined? 
 Me in Milano, gettin' models in next year's fashions 
 So nowadays, they can call me old fashioned 
 But it's way too much cash to see blue lights flashin' 
 So I guess the moral of this here class is 
 Life about who make it now not about who make it the fastest 
 Drive slow homie 
 Dri, uh dri slowly"

 Whooooooooooo, what up derrty? 
 Damn, that girl fine, that girl fine, that girl fine 
 Yo, yo, Kanye, yo turn it up, a little bit, whoo 
 Take notes while I take tokes to the marijuana smoke 
 One look and murder she wrote 
 She drop dead gorgeous, she drop dead... 
 (Kanye West {*over the hook*}) 
 Yo, this is a Roc-a-Fella, St. Lunatics collaboration 
 Chi-Town and St. Louis 
 She said she ain't never seen Murphy Lee befo' 
 (Murphy Lee) 
 I called her back from an earlier beep 
 Fo' in the mornin' they be like ""Nah, I wasn't sleep"" 
 Convenient whore stay on top of convenient stores 
 Keep pictures of me in their Victoria Secret drawer 
 I keep somethin' hot on tour 
 Can ya, Kenyatta, make sure they know before what is really in store 
 See I adore the ones that call me Tory, true story 
 I created 'hood rats so these new mice bore me 
 See I normally settle for sevens, but eights I can't wait 
 Nines be wantin' time and dimes be wantin' dates 
 So know I got elevens and twelves 
 With at least thirteen or fourteen reasons why they fine as hell 
 I hit 'em up like Blu Cantrell 
 Hehehehehehehehe hell, I remember when she smashed LaBelle 
 See most women kinda sneaky like a six-year old 
 Hey yo they always in the summer, somethin' wrong with their nails 
 Take notes while I take tokes to the marijuana smoke 
 One look and murder she wrote 
 She drop dead gorgeous, she drop dead... 
 (Kanye West) 
 What's the point of havin' a girl that's drop dead 
 That you know don't like you? 
 She'll run over your head with a motorcycle 
 I mean the way you look is nice, but there's more to life boo 
 'Cause I could go to videos and get fo' just lik"

 For a special purpose 
 You know? 
 What's more special than you? 
 You feel me? 
 It's on--baby, let's get lost 
 You don't need to call in to work 'cause you the boss 
 For real, want you to show me how you feel 
 I consider myself lucky; that's a big deal 
 Why? 
 Well, you got the key to my heart 
 But you ain't gon' need it 
 I'd rather you open up my body 
 And show me secrets you didn't know was inside 
 No need for me to lie 
 It's too big (big) 
 It's too wide (wide) 
 It's too strong (strong) 
 It won't fit (fit) 
 It's too much (much) 
 It's too tough (tough) 
 He talk like this 'cause he can back it up 
 He got a big ego 
 Such a huge ego 
 I love his big ego 
 It's too much 
 He walk like this 'cause he can back it up 
 Usually I'm humble 
 Right now I don't choose 
 You can leave with me 
 Or you could have the blues 
 Some call it arrogant 
 I call it confident 
 You decide when you find 
 Out what I'm working with 
 Damn, I know I'm killing you with them legs 
 Better yet, them thighs 
 Matter of fact it's my smile or maybe my eyes 
 Boy, you're a sight to see, kinda something like me 
 It's too big (big) 
 It's too wide (wide) 
 It's too strong (strong)

 I got a big ego 
 Such a huge ego 
 But he love my big ego 
 It's too much 
 I walk like this 'cause I can back it up 
 I, I walk like this 'cause I can back it up 
 I, I talk like this 'cause I can back it up 
 I, I, I can back it up 
 I can back it up 
 I walk like this 'cause I can back it up

 He got a big ego 
 Such a huge ego, such a huge ego 
 But I love his big ego 
 It's too much 
 He walk like this 'cause he can back it up 
 Ego so big you must admit 
 I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch 
 Ego so strong, if you ain't know 
 I don't need no beat--I can sing it with piano"

 C'mon! 
 Excuse me miss, I'm the shit 
 You should come, hang with me, basically 
 Hold up, skip all the singin' let's get right tonight mami 
 (Verse Three: Kanye West) 
 She playin' she hate when I'm name droppin' 
 So when I talk rap, she gon' change topics 
 But I got a plan B that's planned out, for when things don't pan out 
 Hov' tellin' ya mind brother, I'ma play shy brother 
 So you take the Destiny Child girl in the Coupe? 
 Then I'ma try bag the ones that got kicked out the group 
 I figured that'll be simple, I'll just help 'em with their demo 
 And she - grabbed my tattoo, peeped my credentials 
 And she - grabbed my pants, felt the potential 
 And I - rubbed 'bout every essential 
 That have fun breakin her fundamentals 
 Excuse me miss, the artist of the new millennium 
 Has finally stopped drivin' that blue Millennium 
 And got a good of trenny and filled it with plenty of Henney 
 And Remi and weed, till she higher than Hilliam 
 If she pass me, smoke that la-la-la 
 Memphis Bleek always smokin' that la-la-la 
 Beanie Sigel, Desert Eagle, the four-ty five 
 It's the R.O.C. bitch, sing our lullaby 
 C'mon! 
 Excuse me miss, I'm the shit 
 You should come, hang with me, basically 
 Whoa, skip all the singin' let's get right tonight, mami"

 Feeling like my life froze

 Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal 
 This game you could never win 
 'Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again 
 Get away from me misery 
 Get away from me lonliness 
 Get away from me fake bitches, I can't take the phoniness 
 Get away from me wack tracks 
 I can only make only hits 
 I'm an only child lost in the World 
 Where did the lonely kids go when the bell ring 
 Its Feeling like hell rings 
 Bringing me back down 
 Checking my background 
 Its ironic what's happening 
 Imagine if I didn't have the ends 
 I would?nt have so many imaginary friends 
 I'm spaced out Dog, I be on that Moon talk 
 Wonder if God ask Mike how to moon walk 
 I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more 
 I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophomore 
 I guess everything I hate about me I see in him 
 And we ain't finna change, so we'll never agree again 
 Till then I'll be pouring out my soul 
 Just a few things I see with my eyes closed 
 And I can see it with my eyes closed, now

 Begging one of these f-ckin fashion houses to hire me, 
 They say I've been an asshole, 
 I said if you acquire me, 
 I can be a quiet me, call it verbal dieting 
 Give me your herbal chai tea 
 I'll be calm as Tai Chi 
 With a bad white bitch like Ice-T 
 I'm not right dog, I'm slightly off, 
 I'm Paranoid Like bonin? Raw dog 
 And wakin' up with a slight cough 
 Yeah, that'll make ya dick quite soft 
 Plus my neck hurt too lemme take all this ice off 
 Never meant to hurt you, I should've had nights off 
 But it cost too much to live and I never took the price off"

 My bitch bad and my diamonds still sparkling 
 Got the competition shaking like Parkinsons 
 Breads in the bag, call it good marketin' 
 Life's a bitch but I don't caught again

 Couture from the store's departments 
 You more like love to start shit 
 I'm more of the trips to Florida 
 Ordered the hors d?oeuvres, views of the water 
 Straight from a page of your favorite author 
 And the weather's so breezy 
 Man, why can't life always be this easy? 
 She in the mirror dancin' so sleazy 
 I get a call like, ""Where are you, Yeezy?"" 
 And try to hit you with the ol' wopty 
 Till I got flashed by the paparazzi 
 Damn, these niggas got me 
 I hate these niggas more than a Nazi 
 As I recall I know you love to show off 
 But I never thought that you would take it this far 
 But what do I know

 First class with the seat back, I still see ya 
 In my past, you on the other side of the glass 
 Of my memory's museum

 They say you livin' like you died before 
 I got a place that only I can go 
 Let me take you to flight school 
 (We'll learn to fly) 
 Let me take you to flight school 
 (Above all the lights) 
 You've never been so high, kiss the ground goodbye 
 And you say, damn baby how did you get that fly? 
 Flight school 
 GLC 
 I got the airplane passes, the aviator glasses 
 She be lookin' fly like aviator classes 
 So classy, Jacqueline Onassis 
 Used to sneak and move like Ali, Cassius 
 Massive, like Kennedy's assassin 
 We was killin' time like clocks in the casket 
 Perhaps its time to prevail 
 I'll show you Gotham City like I'm Christian Bale 
 I can be Barack and let you be Michelle 
 Miguel. Gizelle. Dress fresh as hell. 
 Louis. Gucci. Ye in that pastel 
 Adore Dior, ride down Lake Shore 
 She felt the vibe, I had to make sure 
 She felt deprived livin' like she died 
 Slide with a G, now she felt revived 
 In town for the night, she's somebody wifey 
 The LE, she never seen these 
 So the moment I might seize 
 I done come up out the coma of livin' lifes dreams 
 When you wake up in the morning you join the flight team. 
 Kanye West 
 I got my superman power, my superman cape 
 These the last hours, but superman late 
 The clock is ticking, damn can you wait? 
 Man, will he come back and save the day? 
 Fly across the earth, put things in reverse 
 I wish this life was a movie I could just rehearse 
 Certain things I can't doctor, and you say I'm the worst 
 I ain't have enough patients, but I needed a nurse 
 Got to come by my head let, see if my head ache 
 Then get my head straight 
 Then give my head great 
 Every time I popped up like the VCR 
 I took your breath away 
 Then we performed CPR 
 With all the cars, the clothes, the lights, the boats 
 I guess I was just trying to sow my royal oats 
 In the penthouse position, 
 With penthouse bitches, 
 See I pimped my crib, so I must exhibit 
 Shit, these last years been a haze like Issac 
 So I close my eyes 
 Tighter than Asian eyes 
 Get realized 
 I got the same wings angels fly 
 With Louie Vutton feathers, now that some fly shit"
157,Kanye West,hiphop,Food,"(Chorus - Kanye West) 
 I walked in the crib, got two kids 
 And my baby mama late (uh oh! uh oh! uh oh!) 
 So I had to did, what I had to did 
 'Cause I had to get (duh-ough! duh-ough! duh-ough!) 
 I'm up all night, getting my money right 
 Until the blue and white (po po! po po! po po!) 
 Now the money coming slow, but a least a nigga know 
 Slow motion better than (no-oh! no-oh! no-oh!) 
 (Verse - Common) 
 You love to hear the story, again and again 
 About these young brothers, from the City of Wind 
 Like juice and gin, in the city we blend 
 Amongst the hustle, titties and skin, fifties and rims 
 Y'all know the Sprewells and trucks that's detailed 
 Heartless females that wanna ride in em 
 Felt the southside venom in raw hides and denim 
 Pimp minds collide wit em, a system that tries victims 
 We living in, my man in the fast lane pivoting 
 On the block white is selling like Eminem 
 On the block it ""Jump Off"" like Kim and them 
 On the block it's hot, you can feel it, in your skin and then 
 Shorties get the game but no instructions to assembling 
 Eyes bright, it seems like the fight is dimming them 
 Call my man cuzo, like I'm kin to him 
 He trying to stay straight, the streets is bending him 
 (Verse - Common) 
 It's all good in the hood, like raps and gems 
 Throwbacks and Timbs, blacks and rims 
 Whether on ball courts, attires of all sorts 
 We never fall short, wit us it's our Force like And 1's 
 Some waves, some air guns, the days of the fair one is over for 
 Cats is colder than four below, wit self I go toe to toe 
 Wondering if it's for the art or for the doe 
 Though I know to grow a nigga gotta learn to let go 
 Though I know the doe I got to bring back to the ghetto 
 Arrows on Terot cards pointing to the grind 
 Po' livin' in more prisons, pointing to my mind, shine the light up 
 Clench my fists tight, holding the right up 
 Freedom fight in dark gear for the years to get brighter 
 Situations, and jobs get tighter 
 My man trying to get his weight and height up, c'mon! 
 (Bridge - Kanye West) 
 I - I know I could make it right 
 If I could just swallow my pride 
 But I can't run away or put my gun away 
 You can't front on me 
 I - no I can't let it ride 
 No no not tonight 
 See I can't run away or put my gun away 
 You can't front on me 
 (Verse - Common) 
 I break bread wit thieves and pastors, OG's and masters 
 Emcees and actors that seize and capture 
 Moments like the camcorder 
 You ain't killin' it, yo that's man-slaughter 
 Though paper can't change a man's aura 
 It can feed a man's daughter 
 I stand for the blue collar, on the side making a few dollars 
 Like Sam Jack they maneuver through drama like 
 (Bridge - repeat 2x)"
158,Kanye West,hiphop,Forever,"It may not mean nothing to y'all, 
 But understand nothing was done for me, 
 So I don't plan on stopping at all, 
 I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne, 
 I'm shutting shit down at the mall, 
 And telling every girl she the one for me, 
 And I ain't even planning to call, 
 I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne, 
 Last name ever, 
 First name greatest, 
 Like a sprained ankle boy ain't nothing to play with, 
 It started off local but thanks to all the haters, 
 I know G4 pilots on a first name basis, 
 In your city faded off the brown, Nino, 
 She insists she got more class, we know! 
 Swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo, 
 If I was at the club you know I balled, chemo, 
 Dropped the mixtape that shit sounded like an album 
 Who'd have thought a country wide tour would be the outcome 
 Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm 
 Everybody got a deal, I did it without one, 
 Yeah nigga I'm about my business, 
 Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list, 
 Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness, 
 If you ain't been a part of it at least you got to witness, 
 Bitches, 
 Forever ever Mr. West is in da building 
 Ain't no question who about to kill 'em 
 I used to have hood dreams, 
 Big fame, big chains, 
 I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came, 
 I went hard all fall like the ball teams, 
 Just so I can make it rain all spring, 
 Y'all seen my story my glory, 
 I had raped the game young, 
 You can call it statutory, 
 When a nigga blow up they can build statures of me 
 Old money Benjamin Button, what, nothin', 
 Now superbad chicks giving me McLovin, 
 You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband, 
 You would think these niggas would know me when they really doesn't 
 Like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasn't, 
 You're such a fucking loser, 
 He didn't even go to class Bueller, 
 Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back, 
 Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack, 
 Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac, 
 All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act, 
 They pull their cameras out and God damn they snap, 
 I used to want this thing forever y'all can have it back, 
 OK, hello it's the martian, Space Jam Jordan's, 
 I want this shit forever wake up and smell the Garden, 
 Fresher than the harvest 
 Step up to the target, 
 If I had one guess than I guess I'm just New Orleans, 
 And I will never stop like I'm running from the cops, 
 Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top, 
 Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops, 
 But what should I scream for this is my theme park, 
 My minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark, 
 Pistol on my side you don't wanna hear that thing talk, 
 Let the king talk check the price and pay attention, 
 Lil Wayne that's what they got to say or mention, 
 I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer, 
 I'm resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover, 
 Shh, my foot's sleeping on the gas, 
 No brake pads no such thing as last, 
 There they go, packing stadiums, 
 As Shady spits his flow, 
 Nuts they go, macadamian they go so ballistic wow, 
 We can make them look like bozos, 
 He's wondering if he should spit this slow, 
 Fuck no go for broke, 
 His cup just runneth over oh no 
 He ain't had a buzz like this since the last time he overdosed, 
 They've been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose, 
 Back into the game and they know, 
 Rap will never be the same as before, 
 Bashing in the brains of these hoes, 
 And establishing a name as he goes, 
 The passion and the flame is ignited, 
 You can't put it out once we light it, 
 This shit is exactly what the fuck I'm talking about when we riot, 
 You dealin' with a few true villains 
 Whose staying inside of the booth truth spillin', 
 And spit true feelings, 
 Till our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths, now rewind it 
 Payback muthafucka for the way you got at me so how's it taste? 
 When I slap the taste out your mouth 
 With the bass so loud that it shakes the place, 
 I'm Hannibal Lecter so just in case you're thinking of saving face, 
 You ain't gonna have no face to save 
 By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake."

 Listen 
 Brooklyn wins again 
 It's the Stuy, it's the Bush, dem niggaz again 
 Ta' Kweli, Mighty Def, and S Dot on the guest slot 
 Kanye, you're the dope man in hip hop, now let's rock 
 Now roll out niggaz, my hometown niggaz 
 I get it good in your hood so slow down niggaz 
 Watch the speed though, mind the pedal and ease off 
 A street talk into a collision course with these walls - bam! 
 They don't move, don't brake, don't lose, don't sleep 
 Light passin', light fashion, life happens that fast, party done 
 Black hands up and prayer 
 Black guns up in fear 
 Dyin' wish is to touch the air 
 Seekin' heaven that wasn't here 
 Eyes will not see another year 
 It's another day 
 It's the same fight 
 Different round, sound the bell 
 Mix it up as if you're where you live it up the beat 
 And get risen up you're knocked down get back and get it up 
 Get off of queer street and get with us 
 And get clear where we did it 
 From the heart, from the people 
 From the top, from the jeep 
 From the gutter, from the street 
 From my soul to the mic to the essence 
 So in my absence you feel the presence, exactly 
 I make contact for sure the emcee 
 Me and mine we don't just get by 
 We get free and that's ready [Mos -- nigga]

 Just to get by 
 Nigga I sold coke, nigga I pushed lah 
 Carried a fo'five 
 Claimed I was ready to die 
 Promised never to cry 
 Held it all inside 
 Reality was too much to take so I 
 Kept my mind fried 
 Slept for most of mine 
 Soon as I closed my eyes 
 Then I woke up behind 
 Thinking either I load up these nines 
 Or blow up with rhymes 
 Cause this flow of mine is like blow up but lines of coca 
 And your folks think Hov' just wrote stuff to rhyme 
 Nah, I'm a poster for what happened seein your moms 
 Doin' five dollars worth to work just to get a dime 
 So pardon my disposition 
 Why should I listen to a system that never listened to me? 
 Picture me working McDonald's 
 I'd rather pull a mac on you 
 Sorry Ms. Jackson but I'm packin 
 (Kanye West) 
 It's on I'm packin weight like nina simone 
 Piano flow 
 It's like a Michaelangelo painted a portrait of Maya Angelou 
 And gave it to a sick poet for they antidote 
 If music gets you choked up this is the tree and the rope 
 This is shy nigga I mista all of that 
 Fuck a map, let's put this bitch on the almanac 
 Dice what they hittin' for, 'lax what you sittin' on 
 Tracks who you spittin' on, rap till we get it on 
 And don't let nobody with the power to sign 
 Ever tell you you ain't got the power to rhyme 
 They used to tell me toughen up 
 Put some bass in your voice 
 They used to tell me lighten up 
 Put some mase in your voice 
 Lord willin' I ain't killt nobody 
 But I have a feelin' this album 
 That I'm gonna make a killin' 
 Or not a shillin' 
 This is love it or hate it music 
 But, at least we made it music 
 And we didn't make it industry 
 This is gon' be interesting 
 This'll be the end of me or I'm finna be an entity 
 Kanye, Jay-Z, Mos Def, and Kweli 
 We are not makin' songs no more 
 We're makin' history 
 (Background singers) 
 This morning I woke up 
 Feelin' brand new, I jumped up 
 Feelin' my highs and my lows 
 In my soul, and my goals 
 Just to stop smoking and stop drinkin' 
 But I been thinkin' I got my reasons 
 Just to get (by), just to get (by) 
 Just to get (by), just to get (by) 
 (Background singers repeat in the background) 
 Bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah dah 
 Bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah daaah 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 Just to get by, just to get by 
 Just to get by, just to get by 
 (Background singers) 
 Bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah dah 
 Bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah daaah 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 Just to get by, just to get by 
 Just to get by 
 We keep it gangsta, saying 'fo shizzle', 'fo sheezy' 
 Desensitized to the violence on TV during the war 
 Killin' each other is easy as whore and liquor for fallen niggaz Believe 
 Me, it's ghetto libations seen it all befo' 
 Just to get by, my people we get fly 
 My people we get high, fillin cigars with the lah 
 Nigga come on, even Jesus was stoned before receivin' the throne 
 I send a rest in peace to Nina Simone 
 (Busta Rhymes) 
 Back in the days we was used to doin' the shit 
 I can't call it all in the streets 
 We would hustle and fiends would ask for it 
 I guess I was used to just standin on corners 
 Waitin for paper bags with bundles of crack 
 Hopin the week was good so I could get money back 
 To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by 
 When I was stressed I possessed a side of my strength 
 That made me angry and bleed 
 With the frustration havin' me smokin' Newports and weed 
 To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by 
 Those be the times when I try to rely 
 On my niggaz and street motherfuckers 
 And reach out to wifey and then I place a call on my mother 
 To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by 
 (Hey yo mom pick up the phone, I g- I gotta to talk to you ma) 
 If you was five percent instead of actin' stupid and guessin 
 You had to go and study your lessons 
 And know your math in the building recession to get by 
 (Hook: Talib Kweli + background singers) 
 This morning I woke up 
 Feelin' brand new, I jumped up 
 Feelin' my highs and my lows 
 In my soul, and my goals 
 Just to stop smoking and stop drinkin' 
 But I been thinkin' I got my reasons 
 Just to get (by), just to get (by) 
 Just to get (by), just to get (get buh buh buh bye bye) 
 (Background singers repeat in the background) 
 Bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah dah 
 Bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah daaah 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 Some people cry 
 Some people try just to get by 
 For a piece of the pie 
 You love to eat and be high 
 We deceive and we lie 
 And we keepin' it fly - yo yo yo yo yo 
 When people decide 
 Keep a disguise 
 Can't see your eyes 
 See the evil inside 
 The best people you find 
 Strong or feeble in mind 
 I stay readin' the signs 
 Yo-yo-yo-yo yo 
 (Repeat)"
162,Kanye West,hiphop,Ghetto University,"One thing bout' music when it hits you feel no pain 
 Why every song you make just like a left hook to my brain 
 And niggas try and brag and tell you that they spittin' game just to make themselves feel good about the nothin' that they sayin' you should listen its time to take a look 
 I'm past the blogs and magazines I'm into writin' books 
 Like dayum hold the phone this niggas off the hook and I smoke a blunt and cuss so I'm inquisitive as fuck.what? you better bring it 
 I still take it away and make the best of this 
 They wreckin this and never turn my mind into a pessimist 
 In my music there's messages, decipher what the messages shit I'm droppin' excrement's delivered as a testament 
 But lately they say learnin is a bore 
 I think they forgot the pen is mightier than the sword 
 One time we built our kingdoms we ain't buildin no war 
 So I'm done takin' niggas to school ill take them to the morgue 
 Any song, any record plays, you know murder them 
 Any time I step up on the stage you know I murder them 
 Anybody iller than (?) I've never heard of them 
 And if you say you did I suggest you send the word to them 
 I kill em' yeah I you know I kill 'em I kill 'em you know I kill 'em I kill 'em you know I kill 'em I kill em 
 You know we crushin'if you ain't got the build you got destruction and construction is the work so its nothin' to raise a ruckus 
 Never minded the subject set off a discussion 
 Because you gotta get that shit up off your chest like breast reduction 
 So I'm bustin' girl put me to the test 
 I used to school these niggas and I never gave an f 
 'Cause I'm (?) in the flesh got them singin' oh lord like a boom baye when you see the opposition lookin' boom baye.any song, any record plays, you know murder them 
 Any time I step up on the stage you know I murder them 
 Anybody iller than (?) I've never heard of them 
 And if you say you did I suggest you send the word to them 
 I kill em' yeah I you know I kill 'em I kill 'em you know I kill 'em I kill 'em you know I kill 'em I kill em 
 Sit and listen to the ""i"" to the ""l"" to the LMC 
 Influential colored man on your color TV 
 I'm the one that they see spittin' all they're favorite raps 
 Mr 
 Ferrell nigga stranger than fiction but I am fact 
 And they react like it's a problem only 'cause I'm awesome so these rappers got to give it up like they were (? 
 Hackers came to stop it ran the borders like an ostrich 
 Now we fly but we are mindless 
 Runnin' on autopilot.we ridin' like a (?) sayin' nothin' like silencer we used to get 'em high like narcotics by droppin' (? 
 We just override it talkin' bout our clothes and vehicles 
 Drop a garbage (?) and then post it on the BCU 
 That's it gangster please keep cool cat moonwalk and (?) shoes 
 Can't pop lock with an IV too.to the ill niggas her I see you 
 To be true that's what we do 
 Don't disrespect the name if you do better with that boom baye 
 Kill that noise 
 Any song, any record plays, you know murder them 
 Any time I step up on the stage you know I murder them 
 Anybody iller than (?) I've never heard of them 
 And if you say you did I suggest you send the word to them 
 I kill em' yeah I you know I kill 'em I kill 'em you know I kill 'em I kill 'em you know I kill 'em I kill em"

 And still be looked at like a fucking hero 
 The glory the story the chain the polo the Nike the chronic 
 Empty bottles of no do's 
 Tank on empty whipping my mamma's Volvo 
 I spent that gas money on clothes with logo's 
 The furrest man that shit that you don't floss 
 The Goyard so hard man, I'm Hugo's boss 
 Why I gotta ask what that to door cost 
 House on the hill 
 Two doors from Tracey Ross 
 And I'm asking about her girlfriends yeah the dark skinny ones 
 She asking about the speed boats yeah I admit we rented 'em 
 When you meet me in person what does it feel like 
 I know, I know I look better in real life 
 O hear people compare themselves to BIG a lot 
 You know BIG and Pac, you know to get it hot 
 I guess after I live I wanna be compared to BIG 
 Anyone big pun big l or notorious 
 Fit in 
 Get money and stunt and stay glorious

164,Kanye West,hiphop,Gold Digger (Mtv Version),"She take my money when I'm in need 
 Yeah she's a triflin' friend indeed 
 Oh she's a gold digger way over town 
 That digs on me 
 Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger 
 But she ain't messin' wit no broke niggaz 
 Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger 
 But she ain't messin' wit no broke niggaz 
 Get down girl, go head get down 
 Get down girl, go head get down 
 Get down girl, go head get down 
 Get down girl, go head 
 Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon 
 With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm 
 She said I can tell you ROC, I can tell by ya charm 
 Far as girls you got a flock 
 I can tell by ya charm and ya arm 
 But I'm lookin' for the one 
 Have you seen her? 
 My psychic told me she have a ass like Serena 
 Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids 
 An I gotta take all they bad ass to showbiz 
 Ok, get yo' kids but then they got their friends 
 I pulled up in the Benz, they all got a pen 
 We all went to Den and then I had to pay 
 If you fuckin' with this girl then you betta be paid 
 You know why? 
 It take too much to touch her 
 From what I heard she got a baby by Busta 
 My best friend say she use to fuck wit Usher 
 I don't care what none of y'all say I still love her 
 Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger 
 But she ain't messin' wit no broke niggaz 
 Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger 
 But she ain't messin' wit no broke niggaz 
 Get down girl, go head get down

 18 years, 18 years 
 She got one of yo' kids, got you for 18 years 
 I know somebody payin' child support for one of his kids 
 His baby momma's car and crib is bigger than he is 
 You will see him on TV Any Given Sunday 
 Win the Superbowl and drive off in a Hyundai 
 She was spose' to buy ya shorty Tyco with ya money 
 She went to the doctor got lypo with ya money 
 She walkin' around lookin' like Micheal with ya money 
 Should of got that insured Geico for ya money 
 If you ain't no punk holla, ""We want prenup"" 
 ""We want prenup!"", yeah 
 It's something that you need to have 
 'Cause when she leave yo' ass she gone leave with half 
 18 years, 18 years 
 And on her 18th birthday, he found out it wasn't his 
 Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger 
 But she ain't messin' wit no broke niggaz 
 Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger 
 But she ain't messin' wit no broke niggaz 
 Get down girl, go head get down 
 Get down girl, go head get down 
 Get down girl, go head get down 
 Get down girl, go head 
 Now I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs 
 You don't want ya dude to smoke but he can't buy weed 
 You go out to eat and he can't pay, y'all can't leave 
 There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves 
 But while y'all washin' watch him 
 He gone make it into a Benz out of that Datsun 
 He got that ambition baby look at his eyes 
 This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries 
 So, stick by his side 
 I know this dude's ballin' but yeah that's nice 
 And they gone keep callin' and tryin' 
 But you stay right girl 
 But when you get on he leave yo' ass for a white girl 
 Get down girl, go head get down 
 Get down girl, go head get down 
 Get down girl, go head get down 
 Get down girl, go head

 That nigga 
 Mikkey. 
 Kanye. 
 Y'all know 
 Man I was sick of them bill collectors callin' my crib 
 And the filthy ass roaches tryin' to crawl in my shit (all in a nigga's cereal) 
 Before I flip 
 Nigga had to keep callin' them tricks 
 See I spit now 
 Now these hoes all on my dick (oh you're a rapper?!) 
 Like ""Mikkey won't you take me out?"" 
 Chick please 
 It takes more than a rat to get cheese 
 You can lick deez I worked hard to get 
 G's 
 You can strip tease 
 That's too freaky? 
 Well bitch leave! I'm a cheap nigga 
 Keep my money discreet nigga 
 Cause chickens keep talkin' in the streets nigga 
 So I keep itchy 
 With a clip that'll spit fifty 
 Make fifty million spittin' over beats nigga please nigga [Chorus] I just got a good ass job 
 The pay is good but the work is too hard 
 And I don't want to work anymore 
 So I won't stop till I reach the top 
 Now I just bought a brand new car 
 GS4 but the notes is too high 
 So I'm gonna hit the club and pull some hoes 
 Before they re-posse my ride [Kanye 
 West] 
 Nigga please 
 You work for 
 UPS I work for 
 Mickey 
 D's I plotted on stickin' niggas for at least fifty 
 G's 
 Run up in they crib for the safe and the keys 
 Y'all ain't safe around me 
 We done made wild stacks 
 Made it to 
 Cadillacs 
 And still get pulled over for ""drivin' while black"" 
 While back bill collectors call 
 We ain't answer (""He ain't here"") 
 Light company will have to come and blow out our candles 
 Now you know I got's to take a 
 Plane to 
 Jamaica 
 I 
 Dream 
 Cast [cash] like 
 Sega 
 We workin' with some paper 
 This spins a lot different than this 
 Cutlass I was whippin' 
 Y'all niggas still trippin' 
 Got beef? 
 Pop the clip in 
 Only a bitch would worry about his obituary 
 Don't worry I got something that'll get very 
 Close to that 
 Burn tracks I ain't suppose to rap 
 Niggas told me that 
 Now bitch kiss my plaques 
 C'mon [Chorus] [Rhymefest] I used to work at 
 Steak 
 N' 
 Shake 30 hours a week 
 Niggas ain't even supervisors, tryin' to act like they chief 
 Talkin' bout ""Get them fries. 
 Naw, turn the meat."" 
 Soundin' like a bitch 
 Hit him in his mouth then quit 
 Try to picture this 
 A king on a slave ship 
 Workin' the grave shift and ain't even made shit ?To my crooked ass somethin' put me up on the lip? 
 Drop grease, then flip, get insurance, take trips 
 Nigga what? 
 Set it up 
 Get with shorty in the front I've been skimmin' off the register ""Now 
 Che..."" ""Shut the fuck up and do it my way"" 
 Don't get caught on camera on your off day 
 Like 
 Ice 
 Cube on 
 Friday 
 If I worked in the ? I be sellin' ? out the back 
 Got a gig at 
 Block 
 Buster sellin' movies out my 'Lac 
 Any job that I'm at I'm gettin' goofys for they stacks 
 If the supervisor comes, stay cool and relax 
 Y'all be workin' hard I be hardly workin' 
 And even though our check small, our pockets hardly hurtin' 
 If I was a 
 DJ it wouldn't take me long 
 Before drug dealers pay me to play they wack ass songs 
 C'mon [Chorus]"

 Are you? 
 Ready to go? 
 I know the city gettin' ready for me 
 I know the city gettin' ready

 Such an easy mornin', we on a ride 
 And I'm feelin' smooth as the way the Benz drive 
 Turn the radio down if they playin' that bullshit 
 They don't want black people to think at trial 
 He think he live 
 (Common) 
 He think he live, he think he cold 
 He think I'm high, I'm in thinker mode 
 Eyes low'd, I let the skies hold the thoughts 
 The streets are like the high road that I go across 
 (Kanye) 
 I mean, my whole team 'bout to smash the streets 
 The Phillip Lim remind them that it's Fashion Week 
 And the weather wasn't barely hot 
 Did I mention that the sweater was a Jeremy Scott? 
 Did I mention G.O.O.D. Music, yeah, forever we hot 
 Motherfucker, are you ready or not? 
 Are you? 
 Ready to go? 
 I know the city gettin' ready for me

 As 'Ye flips the piano 
 The mood swings like the change of a channel 
 He's heating up like they wrapped him in flannel 
 Sellin' kilos through your iPod nano 
 Cocaine vandal, I induct scandal 
 Money drive you crazy, look at Marbury's handle 
 Vaseline face, reminiscent of my tires 
 Ice cream paint job, somethin' like Breyers 
 Euro tank top, Dior inspired 
 Sell it to you hard, no assembly required 
 (Eyuck!) I'm 2012 in 2010 
 Which makes this a time machine, not just any Benz 
 Floss for the members of the gang with 28 
 While haters wish death 'pon me, that's many men 
 Yeah, and if you slaim you on your paper route 
 Stop talkin', motherfucker, pull your paper out 
 Are you?

 Don't worry, we gon' be here all night 
 And you know a nigga rep that Westside (Westside!) 
 Westside, Westside! 
 So te-te-tell who the freshest of 'em all? 
 They claimin' that they fresh, they ain't fresher than my balls 
 A nigga seen the fresh like I'm headed to the fall 
 MC hunting season, putting heads up on the wall 
 I sneak peeked ahead while we headed to the loft 
 Man, I always thought with the head inside my drawers 
 I guess that's why in school, my grades went from As to Bs to Cs 
 All over double Ds, I be absent all week 
 This is for my niggas, all the ones I ride for 
 Man, that's the fam, we let 'em in through the side door 
 Hold on: That's the girl you gave a wedding ring? 
 Man, me and my niggas nutted on her everything

 And let me hear you say ah

 Ay, we promised 
 Now put your hands up to the sky 
 Until the day in that we die 
 And we'll be here all evenin' 
 G.O.O.D. Fridays, I hope you have a nice weekend 
 Are you? 
 Ready to go?

 I'm not sure anymore-more 
 Who is knocking at my door-door 
 All the faces that I know 
 You make them sunny and new 
 (Chorus: Mos Def) 
 I don't wanna say goodbye to you 
 So I'll just say good night to you 
 My people, no goodbyes to you 
 I'm just gonna say good night 
 (Verse 1: Kanye West) 
 Right now I can see it so vivid 
 Like it was just yesterday like I could relive it 
 Me and my grandparents on a field trid-ip 
 And I'm the little kid tryna touch the exhibits 
 But it'll fade before I get to get a hold of that 
 Man I wish I could stop time like a photograph 
 Every joke that they told I'd know to laugh 
 Man, man I wouldn't let a moment pass 
 What do it mean when you dream that you fallin' 
 What do it mean when you dream that you ballin' 
 What do it mean when you never dream at all then 
 And you don't really know cause you can't recall them 
 It's sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to 
 People you never got a chance to say bye to 
 Maybe you could pull 'em up outta your dreams 
 Into real life, if you try to 
 So close, but so far 
 And so far, no cigar 
 We can't dwell on the day PAST all we got is today 
 So I'mma live like there's no tomorrow 
 No goodbye 
 (Chorus: Mos Def) 
 I don't wanna say goodbye to you 
 So I'll just say good night to you 
 My people, no goodbyes to you 
 I'm just gonna say good night 
 (Verse 2: Al Be) 
 Uh, to you 
 If I part my heart will live through you 
 Dream beautiful and unusual 
 Wake up like everyday new to you 
 Stay true to you, a hood musical 
 My art will live through you 
 Dream beautiful and unusual 
 Wake up like everyday new to you 
 Stay true to you, a hood musical 
 (Chorus: Mos Def) 
 I don't wanna say goodbye to you 
 So I'll just say good night to you 
 My people, no goodbyes to you 
 I'm just gonna say good night

 I'm not sure anymore-more 
 Who is knocking at my door-door 
 All the faces that I know 
 You make them sunny and new"
168,Kanye West,hiphop,Gossip Files,"Niggas gossiping, it runs the city, they don't know who watching them 
 When they coming to get me, so I hit the block and bend 
 Do about 60, and I put my glocks to them, like plow plow plow 
 I'm gonna to get on this TV and put shit down 
 I ain't finna let these lights skinned niggaz come back in style 
 I'm finna turn to this class clown, should be crazy deep 
 They told my momma I was bipolar had A.D.D. 
 I told em, what-what I wanna do, I wanna be a baller 
 The dream spoilers are for ya 
 Hatin' on you to they man's on the corners 
 Old folks said he'd never make it off the corner 
 They are the virus that corrupts the soul 
 They are the cubic zirconia inside the 10 karat gold 
 That get green on ya, when you get green on em 
 You gotta wash ya hands of em, get clean on em 
 Somebody told me success is the best revenge 
 So they gon be fucked up when you do ya thing on em 
 Now hold ya plaques high, like who woulda thought 
 And tell em, ahem, thank you for your no support 
 They are the dreamkillers, they the dreamkillers 
 Who know a dream, they are the dream (killer Norman Bates) 
 They the dreamkillers, they the dreamkillers, dream 
 They are the dream (killer Norman Bates) 
 Now how you gonna talk about the way I spend my money 
 Everybody say it with me now, it's my money 
 And they know they hatin', but what they don't know is 
 They are my motivation, they are my inspiration 
 'Cause we the leaders, and they the followers 
 And we the nut busters, and they the swallowers 
 They are the rumours, they are the lies 
 We are the shit dog, and they the flies 
 How you gon tell me how to live my life 
 And you can't even get your own shit tight, right 
 They are the misery that loves company 
 'Cause that comfortable corporate job can't comfort me 
 Told 'em I finished school, and I started my own business 
 They said Oh you graduated? No I decided I was finished 
 Chasin y'all dreams and what you got planned 
 Now I spit it so hot you got tanned 
 And they hate on your relationship, then break your marriage up 
 Can't kill ya dreams so they assassinate your character 
 Do anything to downplay ya or embarrass ya 
 Come around wit ya but they ain't down wit ya 
 They the dreamkillers 
 And I'm through spittin' these rappers my most heartfelt flow 
 They be like That's cool, you got some beats for me though? 
 Oh I get it, you wanna be Snoop and Dr. Dre 
 But don't nobody give a fuck what you got to say 
 Anyway what you finna rap about? 
 You never sold crack out ya house or put a gat to a mouth 
 Or put ya fist to ya spouse, so how you gon move the crowd? 
 I bet a thousand that you get booed out 
 I even heard that they even takin' wages in jail 
 They bet ten boxes of cigarettes that I'm finna fail 
 Second you talk about me, they be like Peace 
 This nigga came from the Chi, moved to the east 
 You gotta kill at least one person at least 
 Or we'll evict you from the rap game, cancel your lease 
 How you go to New York, what you ain't never took a tour there? 
 What you ain't know you gotta be rich just to be poor there? 
 The dreamkillers 
 Niggas gossiping, it runs the city 
 They don't know who watching them 
 When they coming to get me 
 So I hit the block and bend and do about 60 
 And I put my glocks to them, like plow plow plow"

 Nobody called the cops as my uncle bled

 Bow down, brother pay homage 
 Don't spill hate all on my garments

171,Kanye West,hiphop,Half Price,"(Intro: woman (Kanye West)) 
 (First of all, this song right here got...) 
 You say what is it that you want? 
 (...A long ass intro) 
 You got everything that a woman could ever need in life 
 (You got everything) 
 You got a closet full of minks, Chinchilla 
 (You got beats from Kanye) 
 I got a bureau full of diamonds 
 (What else ya need?) 
 I can change four times a day if I want to 
 You even tryin' to eat lobster and drink champagne 
 Now you know that ain't your roots 
 For you strictly a collard green and cornbread bit 
 Now you know if anybody know it I know 
 But since you feel like that this evening 
 Sit down (know what?) and drink some champagne with me 
 And let me rap to you 
 (Verse 1: Kanye West) 
 You'll never catch me in that baby momma Benz again 
 I'm pushin' a G5 
 All the girls sayin' that his hair look Indian 
 And ain't never seen him and MCM 
 Now I don't like fake boobies but I'd do it to Lil' 
 Kim (yes I would) 
 We gon' roll this weed 
 We gon' play like Sonny Bono and hit these trees soon as we get alone 
 I'm doin' these beats for pro bono soon as we get to bone 
 Now she like a lotta clothes, I like to see her out of 'em 
 She got a lot exposed, pump up the volume 
 Pump up the volume, dance, dance 
 Don't give Kanye a chance 
 'Cause I'm a Gemini with two sides and two rides 
 Y'all talkin' business, I'm peepin' her thighs 
 Look, I'm tryin' to hit that back end 'fore I get that back in 
 Called Trina and ""Do she need that beat tracked again?"" 
 (Hook: Kanye West) 
 'Cause I came back for you 
 To show you that I'm workin' with a little somethin' 
 And we get the session pumpin' 
 See I came back for you 
 'Cause any rap chick that look half nice 
 I'm givin' 'em half price 
 (Verse 2: Kanye West) 
 Back when Eve went with Steve before she had her weave 
 I was sendin' beat tapes like you wouldn't believe 
 Back when Foxy had a group with Nas and AZ 
 The way she looked on ""Chyna Doll"", I woulda did them beats for free 
 'Cause only recently I been gettin' a decent fee 
 The checks I got from D Dot was just teasin' me 
 I bought somw earrings like Baby that may be fake 
 But at least it got girls callin' me 'Babycakes' 
 Now maybe Kay can hit 'em or Nas with Lazy K 
 And lady may, maybe hey 
 You're lookin' all thick and sweet 
 You need a nigga that can give you dick and beats 
 So go and get Angie and tell her 
 (Hook: Kanye West) 
 I came back for you 
 To show you that I'm workin' with a little somethin' 
 And we get the session pumpin' 
 See I came back for you 
 'Cause any rap chick that look half nice 
 I'm givin' 'em half price 
 (Outro: Kanye) 
 Got a two for head sale 
 Send, send headshots first though 
 Will you beat tapes for who? Oh Trina? 
 Oh I'm be right there, I'm right there 
 I'll be the- I'll be in studio in five minutes 
 Yo yo, she said she want her ass look gushy wet 
 I told her all I need is my back end check 
 I told her to- 
 I ain't feelin' that verse"
172,Kanye West,hiphop,Heard'em Say,"And I heard 'em say, nothing's ever promised tomorrow, today 
 From the Chi, like Tim, it's a hard-a-way 
 So this is in the name of love like Robert say 
 Before you ask me to go, get a job today 
 Can I at least get a raise of the minimum wage? 
 And I know that the governments administer aids 
 So I guess we just pray like the minister say 
 Allah-u Akbar and throw him some hot cars 
 Things we see on the screen that's not ours 
 But these niggaz from the hood so these dreams not far 
 Where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars 
 But they can't cop cars with seein' cop cars 
 I guess they want us all behind bars, I know it 
 Uh, and I heard 'em say 
 Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today 
 And I heard 'em say 
 Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today 
 But we'll a find a way 
 And nothing last forever but be honest babe 
 It hurts, but it may be the only way 
 They say, people in life are seasons 
 And anything that happen is for a reason 
 And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing 
 And Gram' keep praying and keep believing 
 In Jesus, and one day that you see him 
 'Til they walk in his footsteps and try to be him 
 The devil is alive, I feel him breathin' 
 Claiming money is the key, so keep on dreamin' 
 And put them lottery tickets, just to tease us 
 My aunt, Pam can't put them cigarettes down 
 So now my little cousin smokin' them cigarettes now 
 His job try to claim that he too niggerish now 
 Is it 'cause his skin blacker than liquorish now 
 I can't figure it out, I'm sick of it now 
 Uh, and I heard 'em say 
 Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today 
 And I heard 'em say 
 Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today 
 But we'll a find a way 
 And nothing last forever but be honest babe 
 It hurts, but it may be the only way 
 'Cause every worthless word we get more far away 
 And nothing's ever promised tomorrow today 
 And nothing last forever but be honest babe 
 It hurts but it may be the only way"

 How could you be so heartless? 
 How could you be so cold? 
 As the winter wind when it breeze yo 
 Just remember that you talkin' to me though 
 You need to watch the way you talkin' to me though 
 I mean after all the things that we've been through 
 I mean after all the things we got into 
 Hey yo, I know of some things that you ain't told me 
 Hey yo, I did some things but that's the old me 
 And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me 
 So you walk around like you don't know me

 But in the end it's still so lonely

 How could you be so heartless? 
 How could you be so heartless? 
 How could be so Dr. Evil? 
 You're bringin' out a side of me that I don't know 
 I decided we wasn't goin' speak so 
 Why we up 3 a.m. on the phone? 
 Why does she be so mad at me for? 
 Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold 
 I won't stop, won't mess my groove up 
 'Cause I already know how this thing go 
 You run and tell your friends that you're leavin' me 
 They say that they don't see what you see in me 
 You wait a couple months then you gon' see 
 You'll never find nobody better than me 
 In the night I hear 'em talk, the coldest story ever told 
 Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul 
 To a woman so heartless 
 How could you be so heartless? 
 How could you be so heartless? 
 Talkin', talkin', talkin' talk 
 Baby let's just knock it off 
 They don't know what we been through 
 They don't know 'bout me and you 
 So I got somethin' new to see 
 And you just gon' keep hatin' me 
 And we just gon' be enemies 
 I know you can't believe 
 I could just leave it wrong 
 And you can't make it right 
 I'm gon' take off tonight 
 Into the night 
 In the night I hear 'em talk, the coldest story ever told 
 Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul 
 To a woman so heartless 
 How could you be so heartless? 
 How could you be so heartless?"

 Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike 
 And you would give anything in this world 
 Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl 
 And you never put no man over me 
 And I love you for that mommy can't you see? 
 Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes 
 'Cause somebody cheatin', telling you lies, then I started to cry 
 As we knelt on the kitchen floor 
 I said mommy Imma love you till you don't hurt no more 
 And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more 
 And Imma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford 
 See you're, unbreakable, unmistakable 
 Highly capable, lady that's makin' loot 
 A livin' legend too, just look at what heaven do 
 Send us an angel, and I thank you

 Before my time is up, you know what I'ma do? 
 Take this time out to say, ""I love you"" 
 'Cause right after you finished raisin' all ya kids 
 You turned right around and raised foster kids 
 We was the first ones in the 'hood with bunk beds 
 Popped me in my mouth for somethin' I shouldn't said 
 And when I caught that case, ya face turned red 
 You picked me up from the precinct - I was a knucklehead 
 You told me when I frowned up my face and pout 
 ""I brought you in this world, boy, I'll take you out"" 
 Daddy's stressin' you out? You tired of the drama? 
 Divorce that fool - I'll marry you, Mama

 Sorta like Grant Hill and Koby's wife 
 So when we at a club, and she be so polite 
 But when we back at home she be poltergeist 
 I mean provoking fights 
 Trying to poke me with knives 
 And last time I tried to poke her she just told me goodnight 
 See her clothing be tight 
 She was pervert approved 
 So she gave up on life, now she don't wanna move 
 Hypnotized by the tube 
 So she stay with the clicker 
 In a cup full of liquor 
 Thinkin' its makin' her thicker 
 But its makin' her slimmer 
 So our future is dimmer 
 I can't remember last time I took my baby to dinner 
 See I'm sayin' a sister who was freaky and ruthless 
 In a yorkshire terrier in the pocket with pooches 
 In a pocket with Gucc's 
 Was taking my lunch money 
 Just like the gooches 
 I'll tell you the truth miss"
179,Kanye West,hiphop,Home,"Go ahead roll it up and pass it round 
 Cause lately's been a whole lot of bullshit going down 
 A lot of soldiers ain't make it through this year 
 So lets just celebrate that we still here and 
 Whoa 
 Never leave me alooooooooone 
 Tell 'em holla at ya boy and 'cause I'll be comin' home 
 I'll be comin' home 
 Ooh, never leave me alooooooooone 
 Tell 'em holla at ya boy and 'cause I'll be comin' home 
 I'll be coming home 
 My homie called me like what up man 
 Not from Florida but what up fam 
 It's been a whole lot of hatin' again 
 And if they hatin' on me damn what up then 
 I met this girl when I was three years old 
 And what I love most she had so much soul 
 She said excuse me lil homey, I know you don't know me but uh my name is wendy (windy) and yo, I like to blow trees 
 And from that point I never blow her off 
 Niggas come from out of town I like to show her off 
 They like to act tough she like to tore 'em off 
 And make them straighten up they hat 'cause she know they soft 
 And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown 
 And at nighttime her face lit up, so astounding 
 I told her in my heart is where she'll always be 
 She never mess with entertainers 'cause they always leave 
 She said it feel like you walked and drove on me 
 Knew I was gang affiliated got on TV and told on me 
 I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me 
 She said Ye, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me 
 But if you really cared for her 
 Then you would have never hit the airport and followed your dreams 
 Sometimes I still talk to her 
 But when I talk to her it always seem like she talkin' 'bout me 
 She said you left ya kids and they just like you 
 They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you 
 But they just not you 
 And I just got through 
 Talkin' bout what niggas tryin' to do just not new 
 Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong 
 I guess you never know what you got till is gone 
 I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home 
 And guess when I heard that when I was back home 
 In the interviews I'm representin you makin' you proud 
 Shoot for the stars so if you fall you land on the clouds 
 Jump in the crowds 
 Spark ya lighters and wave 'em around 
 If you don't know by now I'm talkin' about Chi-town 
 Go ahead roll it up and pass it round 
 Cause lately's been a whole lot of bullshit going down 
 A lot of soldiers ain't make it through this year 
 So lets just celebrate that we still here and 
 Whoa 
 Never leave me alooooooooone 
 Tell 'em holla at ya boy and 'cause I'll be comin' home 
 I'll be comin' home 
 Ooh, never leave me alooooooooone 
 Tell 'em holla at ya boy and 'cause I'll be comin' home 
 I'll be coming home"
180,Kanye West,hiphop,Hot 97,"(Pusha T) 
 Malice found religion, Tony found prison 
 I'm just tryna find my way out this f-cking kitchen 
 A birdseye view got me channelling my vision 
 Turn one to two now my kilo's got a sibling 
 Father knows best, watch my hands are forgiven 
 We kicking up dust like the colosseum floors 
 Walls full of safe's like they mausoleum doors 
 Getting wet like she walking through my morgue 
 Grant's, Jackson's no room for George 
 Yeah, the fear of God's in you muthaf-ckers 
 This art imitate my life 
 You WorldStarHipHop fame based off imitation white 
 Eliminate the fools ghouling imitation ice 
 My music for your soul, inspiration for your life 
 Every dime made in his life more disastrous 
 Help my young n-ggas see my way through the bachelors 
 While my old b-tch went back to get her Masters 
 Same graduation I was clapping in the rafters 
 The truth hurts every time it's revealed 
 What goes around comes around, this is lights ferris wheel 
 Grab hold and reverse the steering wheel as I parallel park 
 Kentucky derby on the grill 
 The fact that I'm free lets me know God is great 
 Ten year marathon of me selling concentrate 
 These rappers talk crowns but I'd rather talk fear 
 Villian like candyman, say my name and I'll appear 
 No weapon formed against me shall prosper 
 A kuna matata, feet up sipping java 
 Strolling up the totem poll, what's my only problem 
 Scrolling through my Rolodex, who show up my toddler 
 So many hands raised as the band plays 
 I'm here now, watch how many plans change 
 (Kanye West) 
 Penitentiary chances, the devil dances 
 And eventually answers to the call of Autumn 
 All of them fallin' for the love of ballin' 
 Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin 
 Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums 
 Based off the way we was branded 
 Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon 
 And at the airport they check all through my bag and tell me that it's random 
 But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage 
 I need a happy ending and a new beginning 
 And a new fitted and some job opportunities that's lucrative 
 And sold your dreams, you don't know who did it 
 I treat the cash, the way the government treats aids 
 I won't be satisfied till all my n-ggas get it 
 I need more drinks and more lights 
 Hot American Apparal girl in just tights 
 She told the director she tryna get in a school 
 Told to take them glasses off and get in the pool 
 It's been a while since I watched the tube 
 It's like a crip said: ""I got way too many blues for any more bad news"" 
 I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today 
 They rewrite history I don't believe in yesterday 
 What's a black beetle anyway, a ...roach 
 I guess that's why they got me sitting in f-cking coach 
 But God said I need a different approach 
 Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke 
 It ain't funny anymore try dipping jokes 
 Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, x and o 
 Kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I'm got it 
 Play strings for the dramatic 
 And end all of that wack shh 
 Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes 
 I ain't got it I'm going after whoever who has it 
 I'm coming after whoever who has it 
 You blowing up, that's good, fantastic 
 That y'all, it's like that y'all 
 I don't really give a f-ck about it at all 
 Cause the same people that tried to black ball me 
 Forgot about 2 things, my black balls 
 Uh, I let you into my diary to admire me 
 The making of this man, I let you see the higher me 
 The self righteous drug dealer dichotomy 
 I'm drawing from both sides, I'm Siamese 
 The tug of war opens the door, entrada 
 Rip me apart and see what's inside this pinata 
 And rolling kilos in gym (?) is one saga 
 One chapter of black magic, I'm Harold potter 
 Feels like I'm doomed to dealing with women whom 
 Relationships with their fathers won't allow us to bloom 
 And blossom, I swear this Vegas nights was awesome 
 But adios I blow my own dice before I toss 'em, loss 'em 
 Some other muthaf-ckers double crossed 'em 
 Tryna snatch my n-gga back I blew a small fortune 
 Russell with the work, we was like the four horsemen 
 Rick Flair with the flame, I'm muthf-cking Gorgeous, whoa 
 As the gull wing doors lift, Karate Kid, crane kick, no Jaden Smtih 
 Whiter than the coke brush that they paint me with 
 Sunk leather seats softer than an angels kiss 
 But the devil red, tires double tread 
 I'm posting parks up. that gets me double head 
 Tight rope walking tryna keep a level head 
 The bright lights blind look what the devil did 
 Yeah 
 (Kanye West) 
 It's hip hop, this is euphemism for a new religion 
 The soul music for the slaves that the youth is missing 
 This is more than just my road to redemption 
 Malcolm West had the whole nation standing to attention 
 As long as I'm in Polo's they think they got me 
 But they would try to crack me if they ever saw a black me 
 I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me 
 If a n-gga ain't running shootin a jump shot running a track meet 
 But this pimp is, on the top of mount Olympus 
 Ready for the Worl's game, this is my Olympics 
 We make 'em say ho cause the game is so pimpish 
 Choke a southpark writer with a fishstick 
 And I assisted to get up offa this d-ck 
 And these drugs, fans can't resist it 
 Remember, remind of when they tried to have Ali enlisted 
 If I ever one of the greatest homie, I must have missed it! 
 Wow, they both went in!"

 Niggas tellin' me ""You back"" (you back)

 And if life a bitch suck my dick huh? 
 And I bet she fucked the whole clique, huh 
 By the way nigga, you should fuckin' quit, nigga 
 Just forget it, you talk it, I live it 
 Like Eli I did it, jokes on you mothafucker and I get it 
 No paper hoe, but you can have some more of me 
 Or-gy, or are we, speakin' metaphorically 
 Historically, I'm kickin' bitches out like Pam nigga 
 Goin' HAM nigga, me and Jigga 
 And a nigga still young, wanna have no kids 
 But I've been practicing with some actresses as bad as shit 
 Had a few white girls, asses flat a shit 
 But the head so good, damn a nigga glad he hit 
 Got 'em jumpin' out the building 
 Watch out below, a million out the door 
 I'm about to go HAM 
 Hard as a mothafucker let these niggas know who I am 
 I'm about to go HAM 
 Hard as a mothafucker let these niggas know who I am 
 Fuck y'all mad at me for? 
 Y'all don't even know what I've been through 
 I play chicken with a Mack truck 
 Y'all mothafuckers woulda been moved 
 I swam waters with great whites 
 Y'all mothafuckers woulda been chewed 
 I hustle with vultures late nights 
 Y'all mothafuckers woulda been food 
 Fuck wrong with these dudes 
 Try to walk around in these shoes 
 See the shit I saw growing up 
 And maybe you can take a peek at these boo's 
 Niggas fantasize about the shit that I do daily like 
 These rappers rap about all the shit that I do really 
 I'm like really half a billi nigga 
 Really you got baby money 
 Keep it real with niggas 
 Niggas ain't got my lady money 
 Watch the Throne don't step on our road 
 Bad enough we let you step on our globe 
 When my nephew died, daddy dead 
 Niggas took the price on my uncles head 
 Nobody called the cops as my uncle bled 
 So I feel like I would like to know my uncles bread 
 Bow down, brother pay homage 
 Don't spill hate all on my garments 
 Commes Des Garcon, fuck your fresh 
 Head shots nigga fuck your vests 
 Fuck the pig, no pork on my fork 
 Peace God 'cause you know a nigga just went Ham 
 Hard as a mothafucker let these niggas know who I am 
 Yeah I'm 'bout to go HAM 
 Hard as a mothafucker let these niggas know who I am 
 Yeah I'm 'bout to go HAM"

 Down to get it poppin'? Down to get topless, oh

 Or you about frontin, baby I need to know

 So I better get some sex for this, shiit

 Like it's Christ-e-mas and I'm St. Nicholas 
 I got her and her sister innn 
 That white benz, dyke twins 
 I ain't gon lie they only fives but together they ten's 
 And would I do 'em again? Hmmm, hmmm? 
 It's like old folks pissin 'cause it all depends 
 And it's no coke sniffin just juice and gin 
 Grey Goose to get you loose then hit the nigga producing 
 The track that got you movin, this track got you movin 
 So crazy you don't know what you doin' 
 You been telling them jokes, and it's not a rumor 
 I like a girl with a sense of humor 
 To give me head till it ache and it's not a tumor 
 So let me know what's goin' down 'fo I pay for this room 'cause 
 Now if you got it you got it 
 And if you don't then you prolly wont 
 Sissy niggaz call 'em maricon 
 I never hit a lady but my game might abuse em 
 By 'em boots just to tell them that I Jimmy Choose em 
 Take 'em back to confuse em 
 So she don't know if she coming or going 
 'Cause mami after I'm cumming I'm going 
 Back to show just frontin and flowin 
 Jewelry stuntin and glowin', this life is something I know it 
 And I been known to have a hoe or two 
 'Cause my diamonds yellow like a smoker tooth 
 I tell 'em step into the vocal booth 
 Roll a joint, smoke a few, after that I'm pokin you 
 After that it's over boo, baby grab your coat and VOOM 
 Now there's three different levels to relationships 
 Polly'n at the club wit em, talking getting affectionate 
 Leavin' and havin' sex with em, kickin them out 
 Trickin on models, dimes and rats, now I don't get into that 
 I kick that habit, I just, keep 'em impressed 
 Let 'em seat in the Lex, never, eat 'em unless 
 That fuckin' cat looks fresh 
 I got a lion in my pocket, I'm lyin' 
 I got a nine in my pants and baby I'm just dyin' for a chance 
 Who ready to fuck? You ready to fuck? Off the sizzurp 
 Says she ready to cut, then she grabs my scissors 
 She prolly look good but what's scary to me

 Wish I could be Edward Cullen 
 Wish I could be Cul-len 
 Wish that I could get all the girls, yo 
 Didn't have to breathe, didn't have to eat food 
 And of course I want to read everybodys thoughts 
 I wanna sparkle in the light, and drive a Volvo 
 And honestly I wanna play the Piano 
 Although it would suck to never turn 18 
 'Cause I know pedophiles will try to rape me 
 I wanna say that Dracula is my homie 
 Be a Vegetarian even though I eat meat 
 Wanna say that Carlisle is my daddy 
 That's such an awesome name, they'll all be jealous of me 
 Wish I could be in, Dr. Cullen's 
 Family and the Olympic Coven 
 Then Edward can, be my brethren 
 And he can tell me how to be more like him 
 Jasper and Emmett are so cool also 
 And Alice is like Katy Perry Hot N? Cold 
 Don't wanna be near Rosalie, though 
 'Cause I have a thing about being around a-holes 
 I'd run and tell Edward to leave Bella, please 
 It's obvious she would much rather be with me 
 And if he says no, then I'll have to agree 
 Cause honestly, he could beat the crap outta me 
 Walkin', walkin', walkins dumb 
 Wish I could do the Edward run 
 Then I would be real quick too 
 And I could get home in time for Scooby Doo 
 If I was Edward, I would be 
 1,000,000 times hotter then he could ever be 
 And James would be afraid of me 
 I would live happily 
 If I could read peoples thoughts 
 I wanna have Edwards life

 Got the bitch in the back of the billy yo? When my celeb 
 Used to have the bitch in the back of the Cadillac (it's just impossible) 
 Niggaz always hatin' 
 Leaving me for wilin out for po kim 
 You be sittin' back talking yo shit 
 I can't help but I see you tho, I don't get it (Its impossible) 
 Lil mama, for you to fit all that up in a pants; movin kinda wilder 
 Turn a regular jeans in a low riders 
 Tell me can I be your man (its just impossible) 
 For you to eva deny, that I'm about chi-town 
 Represent the city with the deal for 12 years 
 And sell a couple a mil and still hold it down... THAT'S POSSIBLE 
 (Kanye) 
 Get it; bundled up and - lit it; smoke a lil blunt don't - admit it 
 Do it like I did too late - I did it 
 The controversy can't worse me man; I'm eating but I'm still thirsty and 
 Thirsty what is you saying 
 I gotta a duel with a couple niggaz that's Thursday man 
 Why the hell is I'm worrying; hopping out the Benz with the perfect 10 
 Man your life must be perfect man; look at how they came up with the perfect plan 
 Its impossible 
 Got strip clubs playin' gosspital 
 Girl so sick in the hospital 
 You know I jumped out like 'Pac'll do 
 I only break it down I when I rock wit you 
 Since Michael Jackson made rock wit you 
 I done did shit on logical 
 Maybe 'cause we did the impossible 
 Maybe we done did the impossible 
 No matter what I do, see I been waitin all my, waitin all my life, yeah 
 And I know I stayed on my grind, I know I stayed on my grind 
 Its impossible for me to fail baby, I gotta keep on movin 
 Gotta keep on movin, its impossible 
 (Its just impossible) (its impossible)"
189,Kanye West,hiphop,In The Mood,"Talib Kweli: 
 Yes, welcome to the wonderful sounds of Talib Kweli 
 Ladies... 
 I got you in the mood, for an interlude, 
 Raw like in the nude, I hope this ain't considered rude, 
 But let's stop talkin', 'cause it's feelin' like an interview, 
 I know you into me, so, let me get into you, 
 I'm always in the mood for laughin' and lovin' and rappin' and *fcukin*, And passin the dutch and Relaxin and puffin and hittin and duckin, 
 The rippin production, these kittens ain't muffins, 
 Just because we stuff 'em in the oven, 
 My words drippin off the tongue like the wax from a candle wick, 
 Ill the way I lay down the rap, they can't handle it, 
 Cats all sappy like romantic flicks, dude, get a clue, 
 Like Colonel Mustard in the study with a candlestick, 
 They holdin' hands with these dudes like they goin' steady, 
 But, one glimpse and I know they ready, you already know, 
 Slipped her a note like, 'you ready to go?' 
 We make a getaway plan and we head for the do'! 
 I wear the night like a cloak 'cause I move with the stars, 
 Navigate through the truly bizarre, 
 Who we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life, 
 And if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight, 
 Kanye: 
 You messin up my mo', my whole mood, told y'all, oh, 
 Lose, eat crews like crews like soulfood, 
 The only producer that feel like ""fuck rappers!"" 
 Only backpacker with a chip like hackers, 
 Only Michael Richardson, only much blacker, 
 So if he say nigger, then I'ma say *cracker*, 
 Is this the Ritz? Carlton? Dress like, fresh, like, just like... 
 I'm the shit (Uggh) 
 You ain't figured out what I'm about yet, 
 Always rockin' that 'this ain't out yet', 
 But this ain't 'bout that, 
 From a city where niggers plug like outlets, 
 Far as music go yo, it ain't no outlets, so, 
 When I go out, niggers always out to get me in the studio, 
 And I ain't in the mood to flow, 
 I'm with my girl and I'm tryin' to hit the movies yo, 
 And they tryna act stupid, oh! 
 In the club with Silicone Suzie, 
 What happened to real girls like Rudy? 
 With real titties like Tooty, 
 This girl got a silicone booty! 
 And got the nerve to act moody! 
 Now I ain't tryin' to judge like Judy, 
 But bitch you a man, you can't fool me! 
 Act like Fifty, throw her in a pool G... 
 Talib: Break it down 
 Bringin' the drum, keep it funky like a stink in a slum, 
 'Cause see they wanna breed cursin for the things that don't come 
 The speakers wrong that we rap dudes speakin' in tongues 
 Christmas time choice for what? No we keepin' our guns 
 Smokin' a piff to cause a leak in your lungs, 
 You ain't got shit to do like Friday when the weekend begun, 
 Completely done with rap dudes - don't compete with the dumb, 
 I spill my blood for the people, see how deep it can run? 
 I'm in the mood like Dante and Main Flow, 
 Never comin' with the same flow, got it's change, yo 
 It's strange yo, to make yo chain glow, that's yo main goal 
 That's a facade like I'm somewhere over the rainbow 
 Really these cats sweeter than mangoes, Mr Bonjangles-ass dudes, 
 Dancin around the club, doin' the tango, 
 Go hard like Iverson playin' with hurt ankles, 
 Plus, wrestle the topic from a different Kurt Angle!"

 Peep back, got you open wide 
 I'll let you get a taste of me

 Sit back, close your eyes 
 Peep back, got you open wide 
 I'll let you get a taste of me 
 It's going down in mystery 
 Well it's the microphone ripper, party-rockin' gift of gab 
 I hit the scene, lift you on my beam 
 And send you through my high plains 
 Mind-train shiftin' through your migraines 
 Spit with that I hit with patterns get you twisted sideways 
 And I'm the head honcho, sport golden tonsils 
 Inventing new styles all the time like pronto 
 Four by four, runnin' over suckers like a Bronco 
 Haters say the lyrics ain't Gonzo but they wrong though 
 We walking up and locking up the game and sparking up the flame 
 You're not gone' be the same when our flow reach your brain 
 It's about to bust 
 Not your crush, show up at our show in a tacky dress 
 Sparking us, talking 'bout your prowess but we're not impressed 
 Checkmate, populous crush, monstrous plush 
 Rhymes that just thrust onto your buck buck 
 Just rush 
 Just rushing like the Nile River, power we deliver 
 See it's (going down in mystery) 
 You know, I know, you know, I know 
 (It's going down in mystery) 
 (Gift of Gab won't you learn 'em and assure 'em) 
 (That the fire that you spit will burn them) 
 Burning up the track and turning up the action 
 (Murder one attack him) 
 Serving what you're rapping 
 Urban gutter anthems 
 (Certain of the fact) 
 Curtains for the wack 
 Searching for the knack 
 (You're pervin' off the fatness) 
 Fury of the rather early mornings after 
 (Worldly like disasters) 
 Purely just the baddest, the chief clamp down on 'em 
 (Like a vice on a melon squeezing tight on your temples) 
 Feel the bass (as the wind blows) 
 In your face (and your mental) hear the taste 
 Instrumentals even break down on you like this 
 (We surpass your previous standards) drastically 
 (Mastering bass), setting nights so bright 
 (Beneath the skylight) 
 And days (and weeks) and months (go by) 
 And years (and decades) and we still so fly 
 (While the others are just fly by night) 
 And not tight (we keep writing) 
 Like scribes (but we tight) and so wise (c'mon) 
 The rhyme historian exploring everything that we got 
 And even more so we exploring everything that they not 
 These are the glory days for lyricists, forever we plot 
 Wait wait wait wait hold on a second bring it back (we plot x 4, 
 C'mon) 
 The rhyme historian exploring everything that we got 
 And even more so we exploring everything that they not 
 These are the glory days of lyricists, forever we plot

 Even brought the nigga Kanye for me 
 Bless but them niggas shot Big 
 Made a nigga feel ashamed of the the city where he live 
 Make a nigga hate the logo on the Dodger cap 
 Thinking back to that beamer, wish my nigga Pac was strapped 
 But I'm dreaming Las Vegas Boulevard, Afeni's son's bullet scars 
 Everybody king of Diamonds until the feds pull they cards 
 Not the deck though 
 Hip Hop was better off when it was just Dre, Scarface, and Esco 
 Memoirs of the gold chain 
 It's a cold game nigga, Johnny Coltrane 
 Black Versaces with the gold frame 
 Nigga said he sold 'caine that's a bold claim 
 14 had a brain that could throw flames 
 So strange, have to blow they mind, Cobain 
 Mama forgive me 'cause I'm tryna make a living, hah 
 Them niggas hatin' 'cause that Royce Phantom killing, hah 
 Niggas shining like they hanging from the ceiling, hah 
 Me and 'Ye killing (Something like my Jesus piece, hah) 
 Lord willin', I see a billion 
 'Til then, I let my nuts hang (Something like my Jesus piece) 
 Throw them suicide doors up 
 And let that Holy Ghost swang (Something like my Jesus piece) 
 That's the crack music, nigga 
 Never spit a verse 'cause I was making trap music, nigga 
 I'm not an army, I'm a movement 
 The flow is water, Andre tried to Ice Cube him 
 Ice Cubin', roof translucent 
 Chick on my side tryna get my Trues loose 
 When I'm talkin' 'bout God, she 'posed to bow her head 
 Now she all on the blog, steady postin' 'bout her head 
 Got me thinking like a father, is the world safe? 
 Got me clinging to my daughter like shark fins in water 
 Rocks in my ears something Titanic 
 This is my life and it's exactly how I planned it, damn it 
 God says everything happens for a reason 
 I seen four seasons at The Four Seasons 
 Take that chinchilla off, poor kids is freezing 
 Cookin' up in the same pot they ain't got to pee in 
 Mama forgive me 'cause I'm tryna make a living, hah 
 Them niggas hatin' 'cause that Royce Phantom killing, hah

 Lord willin', I see a billion 
 'Til then, I let my nuts hang (Something like my Jesus piece) 
 Throw them suicide doors up 
 And let that Holy Ghost swang (Something like my Jesus piece) 
 Pieces on gold leashes 
 Cruisers, around greases make them cohesive 
 I'm the sun shining with God features 
 Draw closer to a true blood bleeder, soul of a southern preacher 
 Went from dinner with bottom feeders to world leaders 
 We throw the peace up, knowing the world need us 
 Eagerness to live life and see the bright lights 
 To sacrifices we made it's sorta Christ-like 
 At the after party thinking what the afterlife's like 
 He paid for my sins, is it really priced right? 
 Fuck it, I see the light, raw Stacy delight 
 Can't deny my Jesus piece that's so Peter-like 
 Chicks crow for dough, get low for mo' 
 A combo she end up at the condo 
 Another Jane Doe or a golden angel 
 Pendant on an angle, watch the chain glow 
 Mama forgive me 'cause I'm tryna make a living, hah 
 Them niggas hatin' 'cause that Royce Phantom killing, hah 
 Niggas shining like they hanging from the ceiling, hah 
 Me and 'Ye killing (Something like my Jesus piece, hah)

 That means guns, sex, lies, video tape 
 But if I talk about God my record won't get played

 She did what with who? Man I hear things 
 Like when I was doin' my dirt and she heard things 
 Up worryin' while she wore her ring 
 Now she got a fling and where's her ring? 
 That devious is in the purse now, feelin's in the dirt now 
 Somebody buyin' the bar, quenchin' her thirst now 
 Somebody bought her a dress, she in the church now 
 And what's worse now, she ain' gotta work now 
 She cuffed an NBA player from the first round 
 I grabbed her neck and made it hurt to breathe 
 She said ""Security, this jerk could leave"" 
 And uh

198,Kanye West,hiphop,Knock You Down,"Keep rocking, and keep knocking 
 Whether you Louboutin it up or Reebokin' 
 You see the hate, that they're serving on a platter 
 So what we goin' have, dessert or disaster 
 I never thought I'd, be in love like this 
 When I look at you my mind goes on a trip 
 Then you came in, and knocked me on my face 
 Feels like in I'm in a race 
 But I already won first place 
 I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did 
 (As hard as I did, yeah) 
 You got me thinking bout our life our house and kids (yeah) 
 Every morning I look at you and smile 
 Cause boy you came around and you knocked me down, knocked me down 
 Sometimes love comes around 
 And it knocks you down 
 Just get back up 
 When it knocks you down 
 Sometimes love comes around 
 And it knocks you down 
 Just get back up 
 When it knocks you down 
 I never thought I'd 
 Hear myself say (ooh) 
 Y'all go ahead 
 I think I'm gonna kick it wit my girl today (kick it wit my girl today) 
 I used to be commander and chief 
 Of my pimp ship flying high (flying high) 
 Till I met this pretty little missile that shot me out the sky (oh shot me out the sky) 
 Hey, now I'm crashing, don't know how it happened 
 But I know it feels so damn good 
 Said if I could back, and make it happen faster 
 Don't you know I would baby if I could 
 Miss independent (oh, to the fullest), the load never too much 
 She helping me pull it 
 She shot the bullet that ended that life 
 I swear to you the pimp in me just died tonight, 
 Girl sometimes love 
 Tell me now can you make it past your caspers 
 So we can finally fly off into NASA 
 You was always the cheerleader of my dreams that 
 Seem to only date the head of football teams 
 And I was the class clown that, always kept you laughing 
 We, were never meant to be baby we just happen 
 So please, don't mess up the trick, hey young world I'm the new slick rick 
 They say I move too quick, but we can't let the moment pass us 
 Let the hourglass pass right into ashes 
 Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses 
 So I wrote this love letter right before my classes 
 How could a goddess ask, someone that's only average 
 For advice 
 OMG, you listen to that bitch? 
 Whoa it's me 
 Baby this is tragic 
 'Cause we had it, we was magic 
 I was flying, now I'm crashing 
 This is bad, real bad, Michael Jackson 
 Now I'm mad, real mad, Joe Jackson 
 You should leave your boyfriend now, I'm a ask him 
 Say you gotta put the good with the bad, happy and the sad 
 So will you bring a better future than I had in the past 
 Oh cause, I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did 
 I don't wanna fall back on my face again 
 Whoa, whoa 
 I'll admit it, I was scared to answer love's call 
 Whoa, whoa 
 And if it hits better make it worth the fall 
 (When it comes around) 
 Won't see it coming when it happens (hey) 
 But when it happens you're gonna feel it, let me tell you now 
 You see when love knocks you down 
 Won't see it coming when it happens 
 But when it happens you're gonna feel it, let me tell you now 
 You see when love knocks you down 
 Yeah"
199,Kanye West,hiphop,Last Night,"Last night me and my dogs was hanging out 
 Tired of being cramped up in the house 
 We were simply celebrating life 
 Off from work today, so it's all right 
 But all those ups and downs, turned me in a twist 
 Started dancing with this model chick 
 Then every record became our favorite song 
 And that is all that I remember 
 'Cause I had one too many drinks 
 And ended up at the Embassy 
 With this pretty little thing, from Memphis, Tennessee 
 It was a one night extravaganza 
 When I woke up from last night's Salvatore's 
 Baby doll was laying next to me 
 Shoes and clothes was scattered every where 
 I got dress and got up out of there 
 But not before I call for me a cab 
 Hung over from all the drinks I had 
 And now I'm telling my story to you 
 Every thing that I remember 
 'Cause I had one too many drinks 
 And ended up at the Embassy 
 With this pretty little thing, from Memphis, Tennessee 
 It was a one night extravaganza 
 'Cause I had one too many drinks 
 And ended up at the Embassy 
 With this pretty little thing, from Memphis, Tennessee 
 It was a one night extravaganza 
 Extravaganza, extravaganza 
 Only was an extravaganza 
 Yes, it was the things that I remember 
 (And I remember) 
 Being at the bar 
 Trying to ask what that Hpyno hit fo' 
 Knowing that I can't afford to get mo' 
 Here's a broke nigga trick 
 Buy one bottle and sip slow 
 Or, or leave the club now 
 Do like I did 
 Come back when you get dough 
 A fish stick nigga 
 Now we messing with lobsters 
 We messing with Grammies 
 We messing with Oscars 
 You messing with that dranky drank 
 Plus you puffing on the stanky stank 
 In the morning, you goon draw a blank 
 The hotel said that y'all was on one 
 My girl wasn't on shit, I picked the wrong one 
 Steady talking about I ain't like them other girls 
 Well, tonight, I'm trying to find them other girls 
 Bring they own rubber girl, neva meet 'cha mother girl 
 You know they love it, when you love them 
 And they tell they friends, girl 
 'Cause I had one too many drinks 
 And ended up at the Embassy 
 With this pretty little thing, from Memphis, Tennessee 
 It was a one night extravaganza 
 'Cause I had one too many drinks 
 And ended up at the Embassy 
 With this pretty little thing, from Memphis, Tennessee 
 It was a one night extravaganza 
 You know, they're going to blame it on the drink 
 You know, that's just an excuse to do exactly what you want to do 
 J. Fox, Kanye to the and the winners are, that's BSP, baby 
 There's a lot of Black Star Power in the room right now 
 Easy, easy, be very easy, calm down, please"
200,Kanye West,hiphop,Late Registration,"I'll be late for that, baby I'll wait for that 
 If you had a taste of that, you'd probably pay for that 
 I'm comin' in when I feel like 
 To turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right 
 I'll be late for that, I can't wait for that 
 I think I was made for that 
 So I'm comin' in when I feel like 
 To turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right 
 Stop all your blood claat cryin', I was flyin' 
 Made it to school with barely 'nuff time to sign in 
 Yeah, I hear the alarm, yeah, I hear you mom 
 Yeah yeah I don't wan' be broke when I'm 31 
 They said, ""The best classes go to the fastest"" 
 Sorry Mr. West there's no good classes 
 And that's what yo' ass get 
 Not even electives? Not even prerequisite? 
 You mean I missed my major by a couple of seconds? 
 Now I'm in the shop class or the basket weavin' 
 With all the rest of the motherfuckers underachievin' 
 Man, this is a insult 
 I went to junior high with all of them and they been slow 
 If I can catch the beat then slow down the tempo 
 Just notice at the end if I'm too late for the intro 
 Well, I'll make it from the student loans to a Benz-o? 
 Like old folks pissin', I guess it all depends, oh, oh 
 Stop, you're cryin', baby 
 I'll be late for that, baby I'll wait for that 
 If you had a taste of that, you'd probably pay for that 
 I'm comin' in when I feel like 
 To turn this motherfuckers up only if it feels right 
 I'll be late for that, I can't wait for that 
 I think I was made for that 
 So I'm comin' in when I feel like 
 To turn this motherfuckers up only if it feels right 
 You know when you be late you miss all the lights 
 That's right, that's right 
 And when you get back she gon' start up a fight 
 That night, that night 
 Baby, it's too late for that, lately I've been takin' it slow 
 Try and make it to the party 'fore the guest list close 
 With the freshest hoes, the professors know 
 We about to get real unprofessional 
 Like them, eskimos, what would you do for a Klondike? 
 Or two dyke's that look Christina Milian like 
 Hmm, I'll be on time for that 
 I ain't thought of no line that could rhyme with that 
 Yo, I'll be there in five minutes, five hours later 
 I'll be there in five minutes, go 'head ride with it 
 I'm so live with it, look how I did it 
 Been bullshittin' but I finally arrived with it 
 I know it's late and I took all year but 
 You can stop complainin' 'cause I'm finally here, yeah 
 I'll be late for that, I'll be late for that 
 I'll be late for that, I'll be late for that"

 I got the ring, but I gotta have you babe 
 C'mon let's get married babe

 Let's have some kids with a dog with a house 
 A lil white fence, just like this, babe 
 C'mon let's get married babe 
 Let's get married

 Meet me at the alter 
 In your white dress (your white dress) 
 You won't ever need another man 
 You never, ever want from another thing, no 
 I've been feeling you

 With my tuxedo 
 He asked me do you take this 
 Woman to hold and keep the safest 
 Plus to lace her, floss wit paper 
 Crib and a car, man you know tha basics 
 Diamonds your bestfriend 
 That makes sense because 
 You're a princess and you deserve the princess cuts 
 But as long as you gots your defenses up 
 You can never get the love that was meant for ya 
 Shouldn't you know that I use to come through wanna 
 Club 
 Real thugs don't never fall in love 
 Always on the g-o, for the d-o 
 Man I had to take t-o, smits some cutie 
 Since my money get right theses days 
 I wanna give you more ice than the ice capades 
 I gots the church, the ring 
 There's something I'm forgetting 
 Oh, we gotta have J.E. sing at the wedding 
 He's straight out of a neighborhood where niggaz hate 
 They see you, go and eat your dinner off a bigger plate 
 Their stomaches ache while he's loungin' in the big estate 
 And he hops in a hundred thousand when a nigga 'scape 
 House's with a bigger gate, houndin' him's a big mistake 
 He won't surrender, he'll rather give up a rib to break 
 'Cause he remembers when they wouldn't lend a helpin' hand 
 Till he was sittin' on green like a Celtic fan 
 Created a buzz till where you gotta mention his name 
 When you discussin' the illest player that's in the game 
 And he's ridin' with Em, 50 Cent, Doc and them 
 G-Unit Records, ain't no motherfuckin' stoppin' them..."

 Re-Up Gang Pusha 
 (Looking for trouble, trouble, trouble) 
 But you found it, mutherfucker 
 All I see is black roses, drug dealer poses 
 Shoveling that devil's angel up they noses 
 Never let jail turn my Shyne into Moses 
 Couldn't cleanse my soul with them Civil Rights hoses 
 Panoramic roof, under glass like a coaster 
 Backseat driver, racial slurs at the chauffeur 
 Killian loafers, Mikimoto chokes her 
 Photo-op this priceless frame, our wanted posters 
 The Audacity, war brings casualty 
 Bitch have my son before I face that tragedy 
 I order hits, she orders mahi 
 R.I.P. Vivian Blake, shout out the Shower Posse 
 Gone 
 (Verse Two - Kanye West) 
 (You seek out problems) 
 (Looking for trouble) 
 But you found it, motherfucker 
 I miss the misogyny, bad bitches massagin' me 
 Sometimes we lowered our standards at the colleges 
 So please don't judge me, uh, for the followin': 
 Fat bitches swallowin', skinny bitches modelin' 
 Take off that Givenchy and let's get raunchy 
 I have your face looking all Captain Crunchy 
 The devil stay testing, 'cause when you chase the pussy it's a sin 
 But if it falls in your lap, it's a blessin' 
 Soon as I got salad, I spent it all on dressin' 
 French, to be exact, that Balmain was impressive 
 Got used to made leathers 
 (Verse Three - Cyhi The Prynce) 
 (Cyhi! Yeah!) 
 Boy, we lookin' for trouble 
 Maybe if we wasn't black, then we wouldn't have struggled 
 Player, all I got is track niggas and crooks in my huddle 
 They cook and I smuggle, got twenty pounds of kush in the duffel 
 So I'm runnin' through them suckers, boy, I'm looking like Knuckles 
 Look at my knuckles, got the hook in 'cause niggas was looking 
 I've tooken some whoopings, so trust me, dog, I'm good for a scuffle 
 Don't be mad I whooped your ass, 'cause I've tooken a couple 
 Feds askin' niggas questions, but I wouldn't rebuttal 
 'Cause I'm Jake Gyllenhaal, I'm in the hood with the bubble 
 With a tall model broad like I took her from Russell 
 Didn't play the cards I was dealt, I made the dealer re-shuffle 
 Royal Flush, so kiss my royal nuts 
 Ain't nothin' silver spooned, I came from the soil, bruh 
 But now I'm eatin' off of rather yellow gold 
 Exquisite ravioli with some happy yellow hoes 
 But don't get it confused when I rap these mellow flows 
 'Cause all my Titos got bricks like the yellow road

 G.O.O.D., I do it 
 B.I.G. Sean Don, nigga

 I'm, in, that no-smoke sec rolling motherfucking ounces 
 Marijuana mountains, drinks you're not pronouncing 
 Three chains on, I don't need no bouncers 
 Nothing less than a G-stack's in my trousers 
 New Double D's smashed in her blouses 
 Fuck a hotel, my nigga we rent houses (houses) 
 My nigga, we rent houses 
 So many wedding rings lost in them couches 
 I'm just a Westside lover 
 I leave females in my sheets and all my feelings in a rubber 
 This is showtime, showtime, boy, I hope you set the DVR 
 Stacking money face to face, this shit look like CPR 
 'Ye invited me a seat to sit at the throne 
 So now I'm snappin' like yo' ass just finished a poem 
 Does he sound like 'Ye, Jay, or Drizzy Drake? 
 Meanwhile, I'm chillin' with all these niggas, counting all this money you ain't 
 Consider yourself lucky to see a legend before the prime 
 A killer before the crime, a Big before the Don 
 Greet me wit' a middle finger when you see me 
 It's cool, 'cause I can't see yo' ass from this side of the TV, mutherfucker! 
 (Verse Five - J. Cole) 
 Hey, Cole World, make way for the chosen one 
 What you now hear is puttin' fear in all the older ones 
 Downplayed me to downgrade me like they don't notice son 
 Your shoes too big too fill? I can barely squeeze my toes in 'em 
 Fucking hoes while teachin' niggas to hold your sons 
 This the rap Moses, scratch that, Mary and Joseph's son 
 High as fuck with a cold flow and a loaded gun 
 Never say I'm better than Hov', but I'm the closest one 
 Heard you lookin' for trouble, what, I'm 'sposed to run? 
 Yo' bitch invited me inside her, ain't I supposed to come? 
 Got niggas that'll blow your tee off, put a hole in one 
 Now you outside of Heaven's gate, frontin' like you know someone 
 Talking hard, but y'all still ain't push me 
 They say you are what you eat, and I still ain't pussy 
 Fuck it, e'rybody can get it 
 When you're this hot, e'rybody's a critic 
 But when you're this high e'rybody's a midget 
 All this mean mugging from niggas that mean nothin' 
 Could it be my position is one that you dreamed of? 
 Went from quarter to broke to half past rich 
 With my badass bitch 
 And you don't want no problems on some math class shit 
 So check the young genius out 
 Fuck the world, bust a nut, and let my semen sprout 
 I though that real shit is what you been fiendin' 'bout 
 What you been praying fo'? What you been screamin' 'bout? 
 Ironic you been sleeping on the one that you been dreamin' 'bout"

 The passion, expansion, the order of the random 
 See the dreamers see the sleepers 
 Why would you wake 'em, sweet Jesus and life on Earth 
 Seek heaven first 
 Let put in this work 
 (Charlie Wilson) 
 Lord Lord lord 
 Lord Lord lord 
 This is something special 
 This is something new 
 (Kanye West) 
 Her heels set the mood 
 Where did you acquire those are liars 
 When I met you I heard Jesus bells, strings and a choir 
 I got lines better than n-ggas albums, plural 
 King of the urban make your sh-t sound rural 
 She said I hit it so deep she need an epidural 
 Them other n-ggas have you looking like a squirrel 
 And that's nuts, I only hang around with white boys that like black sluts. 
 Tell 'em Plain Pat yo that track sucks 
 We ain't dissin' you between the position you play something for us to listen to 
 I'm tryin' to worry about my scratch minus the crabs 
 I ain't stopping for you n-ggas like yellow cabs 
 I got scripts so why we need a movie 
 And if I'm a douche than put me in your coochie 
 I swear they should have never gave these n-ggas looseleaf 
 And excuse me if I'm trapped by the boobies 
 Booby trap, holla back 
 (Swizz Beatz) 
 AK on the lap like what's that 
 Click clack 
 This is something special 
 This is something new 
 All white Bentley I call that momma 
 My life crazy, like Obama's 
 You talk slick well I'm Osama 
 Bin Laden, what's happenin' I get it crackin' 
 All black carbon, Ima rich yeah 
 It's gonna take you a couple years to get this here 
 Thank AP while they thank me 
 And I'd be mad too if you ain't me 
 Call me Mr Deeds or Mister boss 
 See me riding clean in a Rolls Royce 
 N-ggas talking funny that's old money 
 N-ggas looking crazy but they acting funny 
 Nowadays rappers, they like bloggers 
 You see me I'ma a bank hogger 
 Coming through your hood and I brings trucks 
 With 25′s on it like what the f-ck 
 Hundred feet and better why they f-ck you stick 
 Paparzzi on the water, why the f-ck you stick 
 My face got the f-ck you pricks 
 My beats go hard like f-ck you d-cks 
 Pourin' champagne damn thing 
 Sit there rockin' suede n-gga in the damn rain 
 Ain't a damn thing, money ain't a damn thing 
 Ask Yeezy and Mos we do the God damn thing 
 Get down to the precious lovers 
 (Raekwon) 
 Ayo, open glass on my fingers 
 I sit back like I'm caged but still cakin' 
 My n-ggas is hatin' 
 It's like being in the livest Lambo in the hood 
 You a piece of steak I'd rather be that than some bacon 
 Every project is a throne, only just bigger stones they throw 
 That why I wear a big hat and roll weed 
 Where you going, if you don't know where you came or when you came 
 All you know is weed and cocaine 
 Non believers, no game 
 I'm zooted down, rollin' a spliff 
 Maxin' flamin' like wheels got traction 
 I'm son he's attracted 
 Guaranteed to service the real n-ggas 
 Or cruisin' in a Volvo 
 A duffle for dolo, puffy polo 
 That blow house is where I reside 
 Live amongst fiends, countin' currency, hittin' blunts 
 Only to hear the door rumble 
 Grab the four, hope it ain't the law 
 Or maybe some n-gga tryna score

 Got the world in his hands, world in his hands 
 He said I am the magic man, world in his hands, world in his hands 
 Is anybody out there [x3] 
 The magic man. 
 The show goes on in 6 minutes and this is his lovely assistant, 
 She's so beautiful don't you agree? 
 He made her to the star she always wanted to be, 
 Buhblaaoowww, are those the stars you wanted to see? 
 The magic man could make the roof disappear and every car in his fleet, 
 Was on dubbz, he could take a bird flip it to 3 
 Release the doves, turn any bar into the fight club, 
 Gotta fight every night to prove my love, 
 Ya messin with this joker but you need a king, 
 'Cause he'll club anybody tryna jack his queen, 
 Ima call a spade a spade from the start, 
 He gave you diamonds, shoulda gave you his heart, ya see? 
 Jealousy strikes again, but she, said I'm just tryna wave at the man, 
 Then he, turned her eyes black and blue with the wave of his hand, 
 The Magic Man... 
 [Verse 2] (Malik Yousef) 
 The magic man, 
 Abracadabra, from a dime piece to pieces of a dime bag lady, 
 Each package, new baggage, 
 Implemented a tragic plan, 
 A volunteer from the audience, for the magic man, 
 I have doubt my hat with natural flowers, 
 She wanted work but wouldn't put any actual hours, 
 Her dude had the keys to super natural powers, 
 So she still with this new guy who can supply that white tiger like Siegfried and Roy, 
 Indeed the boy, had that sweet street magic like David Blaine and she made it plain, 
 If I had any advice that could save her, I could just save it man, and I can't understand that baby, 
 She said you ain't no Houdini, ah I know I ain't, 
 I am an artist that can help you escape, 
 Do y'all feel that, or is it cold just in here, 
 For his next trick, TADA, he made her soul disappear, 
 The Magic Man... 
 [Verse 3] (Common) 
 The magic man, 
 Wallah, She knew that I was into the stars. 
 I didn't have to tip her, she was into my bars. 
 A Tender, as slender as the pictures you remember, when you were younger. 
 You wonder how she get from under, the sheets. 
 She do a trick and keep it discreet. 
 She wore a mink, fuck a rabbit just to keep the mystique 
 High like the magic frank had in the streets 
 In the sweetest way her status and her habits are meet 
 Its kinda tragic to see, this young woman cut in half. 
 Thought she was the one but she couldn't do the math. 
 In a flash, so fast I watch her ass disappear 
 He had game, pulled a quarter from the back of her ear, and macked in her ear 
 And played with her dreams, in a world where everything ain't the way that it seems. 
 Under her spell, she let any dave cop a feel, I tried to tell the girl the magic man is not for real 
 The magic man... 
 He's got the whole world in his hands.x4 
 He's got Natasha in his hands, He's got Stephanie in his hands. 
 He's got Jessica in his hands, He's got the whole world in his hands. 
 He's got your old girl in his hands. He's got your new girl in his hands. 
 He's got your next girl in his hands. He's got the whole world in his hands."

 To whom much is given, much is tested 
 Get arrested, guess until he get the message 
 I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny 
 And what'd I do? Act more stupidly 
 Bought more jewelry, More Louis V.

 How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?

 It go my way, Chi-Way 
 This way or the highway 
 Shots'll lay you off on your day off, like Friday 
 The ROC got ""-Ye"" but they ain't snortin' it 
 They just got him up at Baseline recordin' shit 
 Yeah I've been broke 
 Now I'm good bitch 
 I ain't no Kennedy 
 But I'm hood rich 
 So I say my way to thank you to the ghetto 
 And everybody else, thank you very little 
 I took the road less traveled, the unbeaten path 
 I've been beatin', but now broken through the darkest past 
 It's sort of like when King spoke and said, ""We free at last."" 
 Ain't nothin' free from that point dawg 
 We needed cash 
 And we need it fast 
 We broker than Ethiopians just tryin' to eat at last 
 Now all the blacks cookin' up, that almost white

 Niggas wanna diss K 
 On they're local mix-tapes 
 There they go again, lyin' to consumers 
 Get their hair cut in the little shop of rumors 
 Your lil' sloppy with your cockiness ain't ya 
 A little arrogant with all your comparisons 
 'Cause as far as the Chi 
 I got the most plaques since the beginnin' to rap 
 But nah, y'all ain't mentionin' that 
 Y'all just talk about my dough 
 How I left Chicago 
 How I'm the only one eatin' 
 Shut your pie hole 
 And wanna figure out why I'm gettin' that high doe 
 Why? 'Cause you need fire, and I'm a pyro 
 And you a parrot, you copy what I do and say? 
 Only difference between you and me, you are gay 
 Ah, did he get his feelings hurt? 
 Nah, he's got titties under his shirt 
 I've lived 
 Yes I've lived a life that's full 
 I've traveled each, and every highway

 (Verse Three) 
 It go my way, Chi-Way 
 This way or the highway 
 When you walk straight, niggas tend to look at you sideways 
 I say, ""Fuck that dog, I get my own way"" 
 Niggas ain't believe me till they see me on TV 
 And seen K freely, gettin' head on the freeway 
 Then passin' up Freeway, just like it's a relay 
 We stay 4 stars, or better 
 'Cause the couches in the rooms got, more leather 
 And we gon' flick harder, when we could afford better 
 And back, before Benz's, when we could afford Jettas 
 You still dress Ardjo, but only pay partial 
 Stay gettin' somethin' off lay-a-way at Marshall's 
 Polo and Carbesher'), we into them things dawg 
 Back in '96 we was livin' like kings dawg

214,Kanye West,hiphop,NYC Freestyle Cypher,"(Kanye West) 
 It's like I wanna spit something written 
 But keep forgetting 
 So I guess it's from the heart from the start 
 Played my part 
 Seemed like I just wasn't reaching the charts 
 5000 hours, rewritting Power 
 Over and over 
 Some nights sober, some nights gone off the Henny as usual 
 So unusual to be in this position 
 Everything I say everybody tryna diss 'em 
 Everybody playin' him, truth be told 
 The last n-gga ever let the truth be told 
 And oh Mos Def ran to my home 
 And said they gon have yo ass gone 
 Light jokes, you keep playin' with them white folks 
 Can't even take the piss 
 They gon' test your urine 
 Cut all the sponsorship for the touring! 
 ""Where the Dark Fantasy tour at Ye?"" 
 I don't know, ask, ask Hennesy (that's Coca-Cola) 
 Say 'he ain't clean enough' 
 But rappers ain't mean enough? 
 Enough lashes like I ain't seen enough 
 On the real, this is like the Neo-Emmitt Till 
 Whistling- Get yo f-cking ass killed 
 Lets keep this shit real! 
 Now who the realest 
 Everybody feel this 
 And everyday of my life, people try to tell me that I hate the whites 
 'Cause I said wats right 
 I go to sleep and deal wit it every night 
 And wake up every morning 
 And walk to the liquor store or coffee store shop on the Mersa wats worser? 
 Its no verse that would reverse the- 
 In print or in cursive 
 They curse the name, or maybe call me Kane 
 Lets have a 'toast for the douche bags' 
 Then people wanna talk about me on blogs because I like clothes like look at this fag 
 That's what I have to deal wit real shit 
 Y'all don't even understand, what it take to be a real man 
 A black man interested in art, speaking from the heart and playin' my part 
 All this illuminati talk, like my first hit single wasn't 'Jesus Walks' 
 For many years, these ain't rhymes these is muthaf-cking tears 
 They playin' wit n-ggas careers 
 Felt like I'm the only real n-gga here 
 From my last breath 
 They kicked me out the awards and my n-gga Diddy left 
 Then they even set Beyonce up to give the Award back 
 Didn't even know I afford that 
 And she rode the wave as I rode the slave 
 As I felt like a slave as they try to put my shit up in the grave 
 N-gga behave, n-gga behave 
 Be the first? 
 I bet ya no one else would ever say nuttin' and stay frontin' 
 And get up and just perform, Shit is enormous 
 Shout out to Steve Stout, you know what this shit 'bout 
 My whole family, now I'm scared of Grammy's 
 Cause everybody know that Dark Fantasy was the highest rated album in history 
 So I just avoided it, not to be exploited, not to be recorded 
 'Cause I cannot afford it, I cannot afford more shit to be in more debt 
 Uh, it's too real for these n-ggas, you feel for these n-ggas 
 How I feel to be a black man, you say something wrong, nobody understand 
 Money, power, black, opinion, pick two, they would kill ya. 
 (Mos Def) 
 No matter what goes on 
 They may not agree, they may not understand 
 But God got a plan, to put the mic in my hand 
 And his hand and that hand 
 And ideas, and all of there's 
 And the end, everybody up in here, in this atmosphere 
 So make it clear, live long and prosper 
 Much success, even if you wish me the opposite 
 ? I stay on my job 
 Try to pray to keep my heart from going harm 
 And I ain't perfect, you know that from old me 
 My life is real even when I'm in the movies 
 I'm on the ave, I'm in the cave 
 I buried my Grandmother on Thursday, two weeks ago 
 My life is real, as it ever been 
 To all my friends and even foes 
 Each and every one of those, let 'em know 
 I shine a globe, even in the dark, stay smart 
 Stay sharp, as a harp played by a musician in this position 
 Feel blessed to make the whole World listen 
 And just glisten without even trying 
 Even when I die, I won't stay dead 
 And its straight off the head, and its straight out the lungs 
 Looking fly, fresh, old man, so young 
 And I'm straight from the slums 
 And never been above so the ba-bum-ba-bum-bum-pum-pum... 
 This thing ups, let us all give some 
 Number one yo, I'm number none, no comparison 
 And make the whole world aware of it 
 Brooklyn in the building we take care of it 
 Peace out to all the Sagittarius 
 And happy birthday Pisces and Aries too 
 And this go out to all area crew 
 And if you come from the 78 scene and you just like me 
 Say it over? 
 From the present, and the past and the future and beyond 
 Me and Lupe and Kanye we play the song and get it on"

 (It's a new life for me, for me, for me, for me) 
 (Ooh, ooh, and I'm feelin' good) 
 Yeah uh, and I'll never let my son have an ego 
 He'll be nice to everyone, wherever we go 
 I mean, I might even make 'em be Republican 
 So everybody know he love white people 
 And I'll never let 'em leave his college girlfriend 
 And get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwind 
 And I'll never let 'em ever hit the telethon 
 I mean even if people dyin' and the world ends 
 See, I just want 'I'm to have an easy life, not like Yeezy life 
 Just want 'I'm to be someone people like 
 Don't want 'I'm to be hated, all the time judged 
 Don't be like your daddy that would never budge 
 And I'll never let 'I'm ever hit a strip club 
 I learned the hard way, that ain't the place to get love 
 And I'll never let his mom move to L.A. 
 Knowin' she couldn't take the pressure, now we all pray

 'Cause you ain't even alive, paparazzi pursuin' ya 
 Sins of a father make yo' life ten times harder 
 I just wanna take ya to a barber 
 Bondin' on charters, all the shit that I never did 
 Teach ya good values, so you cherish it 
 Took me twenty six years to find my path 
 My only job is cuttin' the time in half 
 So at thirteen we'll have our first drink together 
 Black bar mitzvahs, mazel tov, mogul talk 
 Look a man dead in his eyes 
 So he know you talk truth when you speak it, give your word, keep it 
 And if the day comes I only see him on the weekend 
 I just pray we was in love on the night that we conceived him 
 Promise to never leave him even if his mama tweakin' 
 Cause my dad left me and I promise never repeat him 
 Never repeat him, never repeat him 
 (Sun in the sky, you know how I feel) 
 (Breeze driftin' on by, you know how I feel)

 They love a nigga's spirit like Pac at the Coachella 
 They said Pusha ain't fit with the umbrella 
 But I was good with the Yay' as a wholesaler 
 I think it's good that 'Ye got a blow dealer 
 A hot temper, matched with a cold killer 
 I came aboard for more than just to rhyme with him

 Went from most hated to the champion god flow 
 I guess that's a feeling only me and Lebron know 
 I'm living three dreams, 
 Biggie Smalls', Dr. King, Rodney King's 
 'Cause we can't get along, no resolution 
 Till we drown all these haters, rest in peace to Whitney Houston 
 Cars, money, girls and the clothes 
 Aw man, you sold your soul 
 Naw man, mad people was frontin' 
 Aw man, made something from nothing 
 Picture working so hard, and you can't cut through 
 That can mess up your whole life, like an uncle that touched you 
 What has the world come to, I'm from the 3 1 2 
 Where cops don't come through and dreams don't come true 
 Like there the god go in his Murcielago 
 From working McDonalds, barely paying the car note 
 He even got enough to get his mama a condo 
 Then they ran up and shot him right in front of his mom 
 40 killings in a weekend, 40 killings in a week 
 Man the summer too hot you can feel it in the street 
 Welcome to Sunday service if you hope to someday serve us 
 We got green in our eyes, just follow my Erick Sermon 
 Did Moses not part the water with the cane? 
 Did strippers not make an arc when I made it rain? 
 Did Yeezy not get signed by Hov and Dame? 
 And ran to Jacob and made the new Jesus chains? 
 In Jesus' name, let the choir say

 All you did was play possum 
 Yo, come on 
 Six hundred Cuban cigar in the big tub 
 Medallion on, Dove soap on the fresh cut 
 With soap suds on the Mac-11 
 My big lion haven't ate since twelve 
 And it's after seven 
 We feed the nigga like forty chickens 
 His tail wag when I send him a bag with just one victim 
 Uh-huh, now let me show you what my closet on 
 Gems in the display case, call it a rock-a-thon 
 I got soccer moms paying for cock 
 Asians get it from behind while they cleanin' their wok 
 Coming with flows that's toxic 
 Deadly fumes when I'm in the room 
 Repercussions occur when you try and snitch 
 Red light, green light 
 One, two, three 
 Look mean, got my machine 
 Cried and hit you, please 
 Say shake that body, scar up that body 
 Should I kill him now Ton'? I said probably 
 Side bets, I form better 
 Bust hammers with pot holders 
 And yo, dead a cow for his fuckin' leather 
 I'm not bow-legged but old school like red fox 
 My favorite colour in my hustle days was red tops 
 My gold eagle arm shitted out a red rock 
 Threw it off my project roof, saw red dots

 I talked to God about you, he said he sent you an angel 
 And look at all that he gave you 
 You asked for one and you got two 
 You know I never left you 
 'Cause every road that leads to heaven's right inside you 
 So I can say 
 Hello my only one, just like the morning sun 
 You'll keep on rising till the sky knows your name 
 Hello my only one, remember who you are 
 No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey 
 Oh the good outweighs the bad even on your worst day 
 Remember how I'd say 
 Hey hey one day you'll be the man you always knew you could be 
 And if you knew how proud I was 
 You'd never shed a tear, have a fear, no you wouldn't do that 
 And though I didn't pick the day to turn the page 
 I know it's not the end every time I see her face, and I hear you say 
 Hello my only one, remember who you are 
 You got the world 'cause you got love in your hands 
 And you're still my chosen one 
 So can you understand? One day you'll understand 
 So hear me out, hear me out 
 I won't go, I won't go 
 No goodbyes, no goodbyes 
 Just hello, just hello 
 And when you cry, I will cry 
 And when you smile, I will smile

 We'll have wings and we'll fly

 There's only one girl on my agenda 
 (You talking bout Brenda?) 
 Naw I'm talking bout Linda, from last September 
 Now Linda love lace like Linda love lace 
 LaFace says she like +Mase+ but she love +Face+ 
 And I know that Linda was a hip-hop-head 
 And I know that Linda gave Hip-Hop head 
 But I feel I could convert her 
 'Cause I ain't here to hurt her mayn 
 And she was messin wit me when I was still at Burger King 
 She ain't hop in my bed 'cause of the whips and cream 
 'Cause when I had her in bed I had whip cream 
 Shakespearian midsummer night dream 
 I unzip things and pull out big things 
 They was flashin gr-green, she was like ""ch-ching"" 
 Got em, but she know a rreeal nigga when she, spot him 
 So now she's pickin' dresses from Veroraiyn 
 Scratchin out her maiden and here's my name 
 Now I'm sittin' at the bar wit all my guys 
 They sayin' ""Cheers to you for your future years of pain"" 
 Like ""Dog you ready to give all this shit up? 
 The summer's on its way and these hoes doin' sit-ups 
 And when they see the way the G-5 lights lit up 
 Your gonna wanna have two like John Ritter"" 
 But naww, I bought her a brand new BM 
 He said ""Dog, slow down like Brand Nubian now"" 
 (Consequence) 
 I just feel the need to purge my soul from the work load 
 Couldn't watch another nigga get burnt slow 
 She said her man was busy, always bored her with work load 
 Never takes her out and falls asleep in his work clothes 
 She needs some excitement, which leads to this indictment 
 Believe what you like kid, according to her 
 When we recorded with her, Linda changed her name to Nicky 
 Sang along to Darlin' Nicky, co-star of my quickies 
 That foot is so pretty, but I'm sure you recognize 
 That bra holds titties, those are her titties 
 Solar's so pretty, but not to rub it in 
 But that white Russian did make her lonely like the wind 
 So the over right that's in, on the over night depends 
 If you take heed the game, and please keep ya name, word 
 (Kanye West) 
 'Cause she's just a playa playa 
 That's playin' games wit me

 But I know it will probably won't 
 Step up in my rap game but I really don't have to 
 They are rapping like they gotta I am rapping like I have to 
 She'd be giving me the looks 
 You better cough your chick 'cause she is after hook 
 Oh yeah she is super bad super bad 
 She is looking super good super good 
 I tell her leave your man leave your man 
 She said I know I should I know I should

 We'll put 50 I get this on the first take 
 But that 50'll break the bank 
 Back when my ATM was crazy slim 
 Had a girl nickname sprewell 'cause when I tried to stop 
 She still made me spend 
 Back when Avies was in, my dog crazy kid had eighty of them 
 It's time to hit the dance floor get crazy again 
 And get that +CashMoney+ like Baby and Slim 
 Pull up in something tinted, so tinted she squinted 
 She said ""This car real old""; I told her it was vintage 
 And I need to hit the health club 
 And get a girl that's into the fitness 
 Tryin' to get into the business, Imma make her my apprentice 
 Make her open wide like she made me her dentist 
 And let me get insiiiide 
 Now I been hustling my whole life 
 Tryin' to get this money up and I think I finally got it right 
 And I been polly'n with this one girl that claim ""I gotta work tomorrow"" 
 But tonight's the night, so poor another glass of that good stuff 
 A couple more shots and I'll be doin' fine 
 Spit it till you say lil West's a little beast

 Please, what I gotta win 5 Grammy's before you finally let me play Alicia's Keys 
 If I can't bone, I get a clone, get her there, got her there, grab her hair 
 She vibin, don't stop her there, told me that she love the Roc so much 
 She drove all the way to far Rockaway, for a Rocawear 
 More populaire, 'cause I abracadabra'd my Nissan 
 To a car throwin' the peace sign, PEACE 
 Damn that's like the same line I used in the first verse 
 But w-w-w-wait it gets worse 
 I told her S-U-C-K, before we F-U-C-K 
 I give a F-U-C-K if your nephew's CK 
 In a CL like U-C-K, that's how you know chickens C-L-U-C-K

 Sometimes I think that I gotta see a little bit of brighter days 
 'Cause I confine myself to a city near you in a solid cage 
 And you could look to the left and the right, but I'm trapped on center stage 
 And I could rap to the beat, but I don't know how to change my wage 
 I still hear a pull and I track 'em, and strack 'em, and whack 'em 
 Jack a nigga for the day to days and I yak 'em, attack 'em, and sack 'em 
 Get a weapon and I crack his brain 'cause I'm hustler, baller, pro 
 And it wouldn't be right for me to be around busters, and crawlers, and hoes 
 But I'm a pimp at night so talk shit and I'm gonna lift 'em up off of their toes 
 With a street sweeper regulating quarters, and ki's, and o's 
 In the two seater, Ludacris and Twista with bags of 'dro 
 Smoking and choking, get 'em up and croaking 
 It's so potent, I'm hoping to keep on floating 
 Soaking wet and you can bet, people I'm high 
 I'm seeing lions, and tigers and bears - oh my! 
 And I can't hide it and keep it hidden, good riddance of feeling good 
 I'm weapon-concealing, stealing my neighborhood 
 Would, could, and should break a nigga off 
 They'll see you later, go to the doctor, hold my balls and (cough) 
 Because the vapors and I caught the drawn, brain blown, honey I'm home 
 Give me the microphone, and fools is like, ""leave me alone!"" 
 (Verse Two: Twista) 
 Throw it up if you get high, get blowed, get drunk 
 If you on what I'm on come on and kick it, let's ride, smoke 'dro, beat the trunk 
 All the bad ass bitches that want to party, just shake it, great players get pumped 
 Me and my thugs and hustlers in the party, get money, fuck hoes, get crunk 
 (Look out) Put a little bit of hash and some motherfucking purple haze 
 I feel it all over my body, adrenaline with the Bacardi 
 Got me up and then ripping shit in a rage 
 In the netti confetti with a belly, gucci 
 Timberland stepping on the pedal up in the 'lac truck 
 Want to get me for the wood 
 Better get the whole motherfucking 'hood to come and give you some back up 
 We can get into it and if you want to do it 
 I'm leaking the fluids out of the bodies that want to come at this 
 If they ever got some blood for fucking with thugs that I bury 
 My adversaries better not want none of Twis' 
 Represent for the city, anybody that different with me 
 Got into thinking it's a game 
 And whether you in my city and I talk shit 
 I'm going to kill him, especially if he say my name 
 I've been known to handle my business 
 Or I'm gonna stick him up for the scrilla, from K-Tilla, smoking on a fat pilla 
 Murder haters that I'm full of 
 Niggaz claiming they wanna bring a baretta they'll be killas 
 Balling out so hard the size of my rims grows to a hellafied sight-scene 
 When the dough become no bigger, I'm gonna still drop that 2003 
 (Throw it up if you...)"

 Jay-Z 
 Rumble, young man, rumble 
 Life is a trip, so sometimes, we gon' stumble 
 You gotta go through pain in order to become you 
 But once the world numbs you, you'll feel like it's only one you 
 Now you got the power to do anything you want to 
 Until you ask yourself ""is this what it's all come to?"" 
 Lookin' at life through sunglasses and a sunroof 
 But do you have the power to get out from up under you? 
 Fuck Rollies, labels, fuck what everybody wants from you 
 They try'na Axl Rose you, welcome to the jungle 
 To be continued, we on that Norman Mailer shit 
 In search of the truth, even if it goes through

 Clap, clap, clap 
 My socket was out the plug, now it's time to get the power back 
 Clap, clap 
 I seen people abuse power, use power, misuse and then lose power 
 Power to the people at last, it's a new hour 
 Now we all ain't gon' be American Idols 
 But you can least grab a camera, shoot a viral 
 Huh? Take the power in your own hands 
 I'm a grown man, doin' my grown dance 
 I don't stop until I see the end, my vision clear, bitch 
 I'm on my Van Gogh, I don't hear shit

 And keep my bulletproof hater coat on 
 Lookin' at some photos that I'm lookin' crazy dope on 
 Hand up, talkin' shit, yeah, I get my Pope on 
 And go home wit something to poke on 
 That's what Dre said, but this what Ye said 
 How Ye doin'? Who Ye screwin'?

 Started in eighty eight, 
 Got warm in ninety two, 
 I landed in ninety six

 Switched it for Ciroc to give Puff's stock a boost

 Kanye West: 
 Man I promise she's so self conscious she has no idea what she's doing in college that major that she majored in don't make no money but she won't drop out her parents will look at her funny. Now tell me that ain't insecurrr. The concept of school seems so securrr. Sophmore three yurrs ain't picked a carurr. She like fuck it ill just stay down hurr and do hair cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of airs cause her baby daddy don't really care. She's so precious with the peer pressure, couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter alexus. She had hair so long that it looked like weave then she cut it all off now she look like eve. And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe single black female addicted to retail.and well 
 Kanye west: 
 Man I promise I'm so self conscious that's why you always see me with at least one of my watches rollies and poshers done drove me crazy I can't even pronounce nothing pass that ver-say-see. Then I spent 400 bucks on this just to be like nigga you ain't up on this. And I can't even go to the grocery store without some ones that's clean and a shirt with a team it seems we living the American dream. But people highest up got the lowest self esteem. The prettiest people do the ugliest things for the road to riches and diamond rings. We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us, we trying to buy back our 40 acres. And for that paper look how low we'll stoop even if you in a benz you still a nigga in a coupe. 
 Kanye West: 
 I say fuck the police that's how I treat em. We buy our way out of jail but we can't buy freedom. We'll buy alot of clothes when we don't really need 'em things we buy to cover up what's inside. 'Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth that's why shortys hollering ""where the ballas at"". Drug dealer buy jordans crackhead buy crack and a white man get paid off of all of that. But I ain't even gonna act holyer than thou just fuck it, I went to jacob with 25 thou before I had a house and I'd do it again 'cause I wanna be on 106th and park pushing a benz. I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific I got a couple past due bills wont get specific. Got a problem with spendin before I get it. We all self conscious I'm just the first to admit it.

 BLAOW, we ain't got nothing to worry about 
 Whoop ass, let security carry them out 
 Watch out for the medallion my diamonds are wreckless 
 It feels like a MIDGET is hanging from my necklace 
 I pulled up with a million trucks 
 Looking, smelling, feeling like a million bucks, ah! 
 Pass the bottles, the heat is on 
 We in the huddle all smoking that Cheech and Chong 
 What's wrong?!, the club and the moon is full 
 And I'm looking for a THICK, young lady to pull 
 One sure shot way to get them out of them pants 
 Take note to the brand new dance 
 Like this

 Go on with your big ass, let me see something 
 Tell your little friend he can quit mean mugging 
 I'm lit and I don't care what no one thinks 
 But where the FUCK is the waitress at with my drinks?! 
 My people outside and they can't get in 
 We gone rush the back door and break them in 
 The owner already pissed 'cause we sort of late 
 But our time and our clothes got to coordinate 
 Most girls looking right, some looking a mess 
 That's why they spilling drinks all over your dress 
 But Louis Vuitton bras all over your breasts 
 Got me wanting to put hickies all over your chest 
 Ah!, come on we gone party tonight 
 Y'all use mouth to mouth bring the party to life 
 Don't be scared, show another part of your life 
 The more drinks in your system, the harder the fight!

 Now, uh, me and Luda wasn't good at computers 
 So we dropped out of school 'cause we tried to fuck the tutor 
 Her ex man drove a Mercury Cougar 
 I hit him with this maneuver he just couldn't recooper 
 We got vouchers to stand on these couches 
 James Brown couldn't tell me, ""get down!"" 
 We got foreign cars and houses 
 We got porno stars and spouses 
 You trying to stab one like Jack The Ripper 
 Trying to get two like Jack ""The Tripper"" 
 My nigga Tony been locked for a minute 
 He come home from the street he gone want those strippers 
 And I'm a big tipper I don't even be tripping 
 This my first real rolex it don't even be ticking 
 This my first pair of earrings I can wear in the shower 
 Without 'em clouding up in a half an hour 
 So that basically mean my paper getting mean 
 Four G's in a paper denim jeans 
 The pink rocks Red Hot like Anthony Kiedis 
 To see this Jesus the sweetest of detest 
 We FIRE, y'all RETIRE 
 All ugly people please!, be quiet! 
 Hovah get a beat from me in a minute 
 He heard ""Just to Get By"" and I was rehired 
 I got a track right now that could save Mya 
 It ain't a song, it's a video called Dave Meyers 
 Y'all drop 20 G's on the Sprewell rims 
 I give that money to another to get some real spins

 Rolling on the clouds 
 Dancing in the heavens 
 Romancing under stars

 Whispering sweet delights 
 Sharing souls forever 
 Touching moonlight 
 Hold me in your arms 
 Fill me with your charms 
 Such an endless flight 
 All through the night 
 Soaring to the sky 
 Rolling on the clouds 
 Dancing in the heavens 
 Romancing under stars 
 Embracing one another 
 Filling up our hearts 
 Turning up the passion 
 Yearning for the sparks 
 Never let me go 
 We can last forever 
 Always by my side 
 You and me together 
 Soaring to the sky 
 Rolling on the clouds 
 Dancing in the heavens 
 Romancing under stars 
 Teasing one another 
 Stirring up the fire 
 Building up the heat

 Could you even have any doubt after doubt it was over 
 No one on the corner has swagger like moi, Chuch 
 But I'm too clean for the choir 
 I require, what I desire 
 I got stripes, Adidas 
 Mami scream papi no mas! 
 Run up in your shit just me no mas 
 Running this shit like I got four thighs 
 None has swagger like this four guys! 
 When it comes to styles I got several 
 Sharper than a swagger, dagger all metal 
 And my jewels, blue and yellow 
 The type of shit that make 'em call you Carmelo 
 Rules as follows stay true to the ghetto 
 Write your name on the bullet make you feel special, ha 
 What the fuck you boys talking about? 
 I know its us 'cause we the only thing you talk about 
 Yeah, ha! Ya think? that's right, 
 You know see Weezy for the wordplay, 
 Jeezy for the bird-play, 
 Kanyeezy for diversity and me for controversy, 
 All my verses picture perfect all is meant to serve a purpose, 
 You ain't living what you kicking then you worthless, 
 Looking from the surface it may seem that I got reason to be nervous 
 Then observe my work and see that my adversity was worth it, 
 Verses autobiographical, absolutely classical, 
 Last thing I'm worried 'bout is what another rapper do, 
 Ain't nobody hot as me 
 Even if they rap they ass off 
 Blast off and have outstanding quality, 
 Sell a lot of records I respect and salute that, 
 But spitting real life on hot beats I'm the truth at 
 You kick it like me no exaggeration necessary, 
 Living revolutionary, nothing less than legendary, 
 Gangsta shit hereditary, got it from my dad 
 Flow colder than February with extraordinary swag 
 No one on the corner have swagger like us 
 Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us 
 No one on the corner have swagger like us 
 Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us 
 No one on the corner have swagger like us 
 Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us 
 No one on the corner have swagger like us 
 Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us 
 No one on the corner have swagger like us 
 Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us 
 No one on the corner have swagger like us 
 Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us 
 No one on the corner have swagger like us 
 Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us 
 No one on the corner have swagger like us 
 Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us 
 Like us, like us, like us, like us, like us, like us"
240,Kanye West,hiphop,Take One For The Team,"(Pusha T - Chorus) 
 Doing my thing, pocket full of green 
 Hand on my d-ck in my thousand dollar jeans 
 Your girl a Queen, my girl a thing 
 You know what though? I'mma take, I'mma take this one for the team 
 (Kanye West) 
 I'mma take this one for the team 
 GOOD music 
 Yeah you know what 
 I figured out I'm not a nice guy 
 I shook hands, kissed babies gave it a nice try 
 You know what I hate pictures of other peoples kids 
 I hate plastic couches in other peoples cribs 
 I hate when other peoples crib's smell like sh-t 
 I hate when I leave, I smell like the crib 
 What's the cause of the poor smell? 
 She said ""I just cleaned up baby I can't tell"" 
 Why every ghetto b-tch gotta smell like Love Spell 
 Or that God-damn cucumber bath and body works 
 I can still smell the sweat the sh-t hardly works 
 What about Cool Water that sh-t probably worse 
 Is he a classic like the Ladi Dadi verse 
 And my man probably hollered at the hottie first 
 I score, he took the charge 
 Ooh, that sh-t gotta hurt 
 (Pusha T - Chorus) 
 (Pusha T) 
 Nevermind me, 'Ye have fun 
 If the cops ask, that's my gun 
 That's my weed, anything you need 
 I'mma take, I'mma take, I'mma take this one for the team 
 One fat ass, one flat ass 
 N-gga hit the switcheroo on my black ass 
 Ever seen Joe's jeans on a jackass 
 And my b-tch got on tights with a tac ass 
 I'm a fly n-gga and I carry on 
 With the bottles of that Rose and Perignon 
 Ever seen how a kingpin carry's on 
 Dookie chain and a herringbone 
 Real sh-t, gotta feel this 
 First class flights baby that's a field trip 
 Double date don't cooperate, kill switch 
 F-ck me and my man, you a real b-tch 
 (Kanye West) 
 Ladies and gentleman 
 It's G.O.O.D music in the house 
 And we got Keri 
 (Keri Hilson) 
 All I know you the one that I heard about 
 Know you work your way up through word of mouth 
 Plus I'mma have to test you in and out 
 It's a dirty job but sometimes you gotta take it for the team 
 Take it for the team 
 Take it for the team 
 Take it for the team 
 (I like your mentality baby) 
 (Cyhi The Prynce) 
 I'm blowing on stinky that come in a jar 
 I'm playing with her kitty later come in the car 
 She a red bone but her cousin is dark 
 A little out of shape but you'll f-ck in the dark 
 Until she start complaining 'bout her feet hurt 
 I'm trying f-ck, she talking she wanna eat first 
 I'm like why did this b-tch have to bring her 
 I'm tryna get her back to the nest so I can sting her 
 So I hit Big Sean on the ringer 
 I said I gotta chick for you that'd like a singer 
 On a scale of 1-10 she's a 15?er 
 Meaner, shoulda seen a n-gga face when he seen her 
 He said the b-tch wasn't pretty enough to finger 
 Though on my team she will be a fifth stringer 
 I said I got the fine one and the beamer 
 I'm the point guard and I need wing... 
 (Keri Hilson) 
 Take it for the team 
 Take it for the team

 What'd you hear this time 
 Go on and speak your mind 
 I know somebody's lyin' 
 It's always somethin' 
 Her auntie told your cousin 
 Then all your homies jumped in 
 And the whole hood's buzzin' 
 Then he said, she said 
 Don't let it get in ya head 
 Baby don't say 
 Somethin' that you will regret 
 I'm on your team 
 It's us against them you'll see 
 Hey, hey, hey 
 They ain't gon' stop 
 They just want what we got 
 The more they talk about our love 
 The more they make it obvious 
 The more they seem so envious 
 How can they talk about our love 
 (When they don't know) 
 When they don't know one thing about 
 (Us) 
 And then they just runnin' they mouths 
 (So) 
 All we do is tune them out 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh 
 I swear they got some nerve 
 Spreading what they heard 
 I can't give them no words 
 I can't be concerned with all that talk 
 I won't be involved, that's my word 
 See I'm not the one 
 They got me confused 
 They got me messed up 
 Don't you think I've had enough 
 When it comes to what we do 
 All that matters is us two 
 Don't pay them no mind 
 We just gon' show and prove 
 The more they talk about our love 
 (Hey, hey) 
 The more they make it obvious 
 The more they seem so envious 
 (Baby) 
 How can they talk about our love 
 (Why you talkin' about me) 
 When they don't know one thing about 
 (Us) 
 And then they just runnin' they mouths 
 (So) 
 All we do is tune them out 
 Kanye... 
 (Kanye's rap verse) 
 Here's a couple of things I can't honor, man 
 How you listen to a girl that still wanna man 
 Tell me the truth is that a man or Juwanna Mann 
 I'm wonderin' why she ""ret to go"" like Wanda then 
 When we met you was a V like Madonna, man 
 Now you in the field runnin' plays like Donovan 
 McNabb before you get in a cab 
 I'll trade in my cab 
 Just to take you back to last summer, man 
 You don't remember when you was my sweetest 
 You don't remember when I called you Reese's Pieces 
 'Cause it's no wrong way to do you know what 
 She turned around and giggle said; ""You so nuts!"" 
 But nowadays we actin' way too grown up 
 Like how ya ex girl get the new numba 
 The rumors was so numerous 
 For stickin' by me, I had to give you two thumbs up 
 And that's why 
 The more they talk about our love 
 (The more they talk about our love) 
 The more they make it obvious 
 The more they seem so envious 
 How can they talk about our love 
 (People shouldn't talk about us!) 
 When they don't know one thing about 
 (Us) (No) 
 And then they just runnin' they mouths 
 (So) (Whoo!) 
 All we do is tune them out 
 Go on... oh... 
 The more they talk about our love 
 (Tune it out baby) 
 The more they make it obvious 
 The more they seem so envious 
 (Woo, woo, heeey) 
 How can they talk about our love? 
 (Let's not talk about it baby) 
 When they don't know one thing about 
 (Us) 
 And then they just runnin' they mouths 
 (So) 
 All we do is tune them out 
 I don't wanna hear it no more..."

 It ain't safe in the city, watch the throne 
 You say I care more about them Basquion's, Basquiats 
 She learning a new word, its yacht 
 Blew the world up as soon as I hit the club with her 
 Too Short called, told me ""I fell in love with her"" 
 Seen by actors, ball players and drug dealers 
 And some lesbians that never loved niggas 
 Twisted love story ""True Romance"" 
 Mary Magdalene from a pole dance 
 I'm a freak huh, rock star life 
 The second girl with us, that's our wife 
 Hey boys and girls, I got a new riddle 
 Who's the new old perv that's tryna play second fiddle 
 No disrespect, I'm not tryna belittle 
 But my dick worth money I put Monie in the middle 
 I've been waiting for a long long time (Where she at? In the middle) 
 Just to get off and throw my hands up high 
 And live my life, and live my life 
 Just to get off and throw my hands up high, high, high, high 
 Silly little vixen, mixes 'til morning 
 I'm yearning, oh, yeah 
 Swear you never strolled on a bottle of that potion 
 Stop motion, ooh, yeah 
 Go harder than a nigga for a nigga go figure 
 Told me ""keep my own money"" if we ever did split up 
 How can somethin' so gangsta be so pretty in pictures? 
 With jeans and a blazer and some Louboutin slippers 
 Uh, Picasso was alive he woulda made her 
 That's right nigga Mona Lisa can't fade her 
 I mean Marilyn Monroe, she's quite nice 
 But why all the pretty icons always all white 
 Put some colored girls in the MoMA 
 Half these broads ain't got nothing on Willona 
 Don't make me bring Thelma in it 
 Bring Halle, bring Penélope and Salma in it 
 Back to my Beyonces 
 You deserve three stacks for the Andre 
 Call Larry Gagosian, you belong in museums 
 You belong in Vintage clothes watching the whole building 
 You belong with niggas who used to be known for dope dealing 
 You too dope for any of those civilians 
 Now shoot trigga, stop looking at her tits 
 Get ya own dog ya heard 
 That's my bitch 
 I've been waiting for a long long time 
 Just to get off and throw my hands up high 
 And live my life, and live my life

 From a good guy, look alive, look alive, look or try 
 You know that old saying what they say about good guys

 And when it comes down to it, I'm a ride for my team 
 See it's a beautiful life, but the bills will make it ugly 
 And the beauty of life, is when you're forced to make it ugly 
 Had a beautiful night, until a storm done made it ugly 
 And a beautiful wife, now we divorcing and its ugly 
 Now my mind state is ugly, my blind dates are ugly 
 I'm ready to turn it up in the streets and make it ugly 
 Used to sit in Mr. Uglies with these chickens that were ugly 
 And these bitches used to bug me to the point it made me ugly 
 Say things that were ugly in regards to their tummies 
 But I took it all back, 'cause God don't like ugly 
 Now I'm curbin my bad words, they say that the bad burn 
 I left it on bad terms, with a chic with a bad perm 
 Whose case took a bad turn, and face caught a bad burn 
 And took the news bad when they said she had bad germs 
 The bad thing about it, the bitch was bad and 'bout it 
 But the pussy smelled bad, so I had to get up out it 
 So now we got bad blood, her son is a bad blood 
 But it happens in the hood when you inherit that bad blood 
 And once it get bad, it be bad for good 
 That's bad meaning bad not bad meaning good 
 But I greet it as good, when you leave with the good 
 It's all good in the hood, got called good 'cause I'm good 
 Now I'm havin' some good nights, livin' this good life 
 Got me a good girl that I'm gon make me a good wife 
 So I'm, good to go, and I'm good where I go

 (Intro - Kanye West) 
 You just popped in the Kanye West 
 Get right for the summer workout tape 
 And ladies if you follow these instructions exactly 
 You might bear to pull you a rapper, a NBA player 
 Man, at least a dude wit' a car 
 So first of all we gon' work on the stomach 
 Nobody wants a little tight ass! 
 (Verse 1 - Kanye West) 
 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and get them sit ups right and 
 Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this 
 Give head, stop breathe, get up, check your weave 
 Don't drop the blunt and disrespect the weed 
 Pick up your son and don't disrespect your seed 
 It's a party tonight and ooh she's so excited 
 Tell me who's invited: you, your friends and my dick 
 What's scary to me is Henny makes girls look like Halle Berry to me 
 So excuse me miss, I forgot your name 
 Thank you, God bless you, good night I came... 
 I came... 
 I came... 
 (Chorus - Kanye West) 
 It's been a week without me 
 And she feel weak without me 
 She wanna talk it out but 
 Ain't nothin' to talk about 
 'Lest, she talkin' about freakin' out 
 Then maybe we can work it out 
 Work it out (Come on) [4x] 
 Work it out now 
 Maybe we can work it out (Come on, come on) 
 (Verse 2 - Kanye West) 
 Oh girl your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette 
 My name Kanye from the Jigga set Twista said get it wet 
 Ooh girl your breath is HARSH 
 Cover your mouth up like you got SARS

 This ain't a scene, it's a god damn arms race 
 This ain't a scene, it's a god damn arms race 
 This ain't a scene, it's a god damn arms race 
 I'm not a shoulder to cry on, but I digress 
 I'm a leading man and the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, oh-so intricate 
 I'm a leading man and the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, oh-so intricate 
 I wrote the gospel on giving up (You look pretty sinking) 
 But the real bombshells have already sunk (Prima donnas of the gutter) 
 At night we're painting your trash gold while you sleep 
 Crashing not like hips or cars 
 No, more like parties

 I can't live my I 
 I can't live my life this way 
 Continuely get high 
 Instead of runnin' round lock one bird down 
 It's a new day gotta do it big just to get by (all right) 
 Show no respect can't live that way 
 Ya hold my cheque can't live that way 
 Without my chick on deck can't live that way 
 They say what they like but I been that way 
 Our moves calculated through the lense 
 Almost here 
 Success will be the best revenge 
 And now from Clint East to Kanye West 
 The sun can't chill but everday it sets (every day) 
 This time I made up my mind 
 This time I'm deck on the grind 
 I know there's thing in my life 
 That I'ma let go startin tonight 
 I can't li my I, I can't li my 
 I can't li my I, I can't li my 
 I can't li my I, I can't li my

 Look down 
 Go ahead flip a coin so the game can start 
 Believe I know the drama give name to part 
 I know before the hot flame came the spark 
 It's like before the pop fame came to pour 
 But this industry will play with your life man 
 They're playin' with rent, food water and lights man 
 That's why I rock the beats like that old totty T Jam 
 The batter ram then I'm off to Amsterdam 
 To rest up a strength to deal with this weight 
 To deal with these deals to deal with this hate 
 I dedicate this to Jam Master J 
 Run DMC showed me how to walk this way"
249,Kanye West,hiphop,Through The Wire (Remix),"Yo Ferris, they can't stop me from rappin', can they? 
 I spit it through the wire, man 
 If this ain't dedication I don't know what is, man 
 Listen, first of all I want to thank you for your support 
 Chi-Town, what's goin' on? 
 Uh, yeah, feels like, uh, every sunshine is brighter 
 Sunsets feel righter 
 Please light ya lighter for the producer and the writer 
 Feel like God wrote this 
 I'm just here to quote this 
 I don't know if you notice but them accident pictures were bogus 
 Doctor, doctor, would you please say somethin'? 
 I know I almost was the final destination 
 I musta had a blessin' from Pastor Mason 
 'Cause that trip to L.A. coulda been my last vacation 
 And, man, I know I can drop a down payment on that Porsche Cayenne 
 But, what, I went along with the plan 
 Paid for my own video, directed by my man 
 Man, I know God was holdin' my hand 
 Wouldn't let me go before I go on Def Poetry Jam 
 Wouldn't let me throw in the towel 'fore I got to throw in some vowels 
 'Bout what we goin' through now 
 Girls got a crush on me like I did beats for Mr. Cheeks 
 And since the accident they tellin' me it's the cheeks 
 And if you look at history 
 That last rapper that almost died sold 6.5 
 'Cept I'm comin' from the Chi 
 Through the wire to the wall 
 All my rhymes is raw 
 All these beats beats beats beats beats 
 All of them could have been lost 
 I always got to floss 
 I almost paid the cost 
 So before I go to sleep sleep sleep 
 Always thank the Lord 
 For this mic and my keyboard 
 Heck naw, that boy is raw 
 You hear that? That's all that jewelry I got on man 
 Sometimes I take it off at the airport but I still get stopped 
 They be like ""There go Kayne, there go Kayne! 
 Can I see some I.D. please? So thank you very much"" 
 First of all, my momma named me Kanye so y'all gon' call me Kanye 
 I'm like the girl on the 'Sixth Sense' 
 ""I'm feelin' much better now"" 
 I feel a whole hell of a lot better man"

 I mean, I ain't really into rims and all that 
 If I'ma take, five, ten stacks of some D's it's gon' be a different kind of D's

 Kanye's got stacks, y'all already know that 
 Louis that, Goucci this, just got a model chick 
 (Throw some D's on that bitch!) 
 Just got a stripper chick

 Cute little college chick, linin' up a scholarship 
 Just got a school grant, spent that on some new tits 
 (Throw some D's on that bitch!) 
 Ain't that a true bitch? 
 (Throw some D's on that bitch!) 
 Let me show you how to do this shit 
 (Verse One) 
 Get you a cute chick, face got potential 
 Working with her little hips, waist like a pencil 
 Know how niggas play you, but you know how 'Ye do 
 Says she love Beyonce, let me upgrade you 
 Spanish chick grab my chain, says ""is that He-Su's?"" 
 If I'm unfaithful, blame it on the Grey Goose 
 All my friends says implants is a selfish gift, they all up in 
 She ain't pregnant but about to have twins 
 Now, is it real love, I need to ask Cupid 
 She real smart but her ass stupid 
 And she gon' finish school and get all type of degrees 
 But I bet she never had them D's...

 Man, that's a prerequisite 
 Cute chick living good, down here in Hollywood 
 Upcoming actress, but she got a flat chest 
 (Throw some D's on that bitch!) 
 That'll give her access 
 (Throw some D's on that bitch!) 
 Let me show you what happened 
 (Verse Two) 
 Walking down Melrose, spot where they sell clothes 
 That chick know she bad, tell by the Chloe bag 
 She ain't no hoodrat, she ain't gotta prove that 
 I peep the McCartney's, Stella got her groove back 
 Hold on, lemme ask you, why you spend your money on that shallow shit? 
 Why don't you buy some bigger tits? 
 Something that'll last you 
 I couldn't tell you if Halle's really real 
 But I'ma let you know soon as I get a chance to feel 
 I don't need no hands to know Lindsey Lohan 
 She on the same program as Britney, is you wit' me? 
 That's why I respect Alicia Keys

 I'ma just ride out with these"

252,Kanye West,hiphop,U Ain't Neva Gotz Ask,"Talkin' practice baby 
 Only thing is 
 I'm not the shooter 
 I'm the bullet, bitch 
 (Verse One: Kanye West) 
 They say your attitude determines your latitude 
 I'm high as a motherfucker - fly as a motherfucker 
 And still the motherfucker you love to hate 
 But can't - because you love what I make 
 Now ain't - that about a bitch 
 That Imma talk shit until I'm out of hits 
 They don't want to turn they speakers up they claim I ain't deep enough 
 All that talkin' I feed off of - keep it up 
 I'm relaxin' my feet is up - I'm leavin' you haters 
 Like when Shaq left the Lakers just to ""Heat"" it up 
 I state the stats to stunt - I don't need to front 
 There black history e'ry day - I don't need a month 
 The survey says - by the streets according 
 Kanye's just important as Michael Jordan 
 Was to the NBA when he was scorin' 
 Ralph Lauren was borin' before I wore him and... 
 You ain't neva gotta ask again 
 How we got the world to listen 
 It ain't easy to pretend 
 I know you lost your cool 
 And it starting to come back again 
 Wake and stop it's just the beginning 
 You ain't never gotta ask again 
 Baby this is what we do 
 (Verse Two: Lil Wayne) 
 Yeah, what you want 
 And if you strap, we can trade like the Dial Jones 
 Where the Muh 
 Hope he got his towel on 
 I ain't at the moon 
 And get my howl on 
 Some niggas cry wolf, I'm on that dry cush 
 And when it comes to that paper I stack books 
 Yeah, You heard what I said 
 I can put you on your feet or put some money on your head 
 Life ain't cheap 
 You're better off dead if you can't pay the fee 
 Shoutout ma nigga fee 
 See every muthafucka at the door don't get a key 
 You outside lookin' in, so tell me what you see 
 Its about money it's bigger than me 
 I told my homies don't kill him bring the nigga to me, yeah 
 Don't miss, you fuckin' with the hitmen 
 Kidnap a nigga, make him feel like a kid again 
 You ain't Neva gotta ask again 
 How we got the world to listen 
 It ain't east to pretend 
 I know you lost your cool 
 And it statting to come back again 
 Wake and stop its just the beginning 
 You ain't never gotta ask again 
 Baby this is what we do 
 (Verse Three: T.I.) 
 Now, e'rybody wanna be the king of the South 
 When, they ain't runnin' a damn thing but they mouth 
 No doubt, it's all good, y'all just statin y'all opinion 
 But in the South and in the hood it's understood without sayin' 
 It's a given, and ain't because of what I'm doin' for a livin' 
 It's, mo' because of what I do and how I'm livin' 
 Not to mention when I'm rappin' I'm just hurtin' niggaz feelings 
 (Niggaz feelings) And still chillin' on somethin' that's into healing 
 Made provisions for the clique to continue keepin' it pimpin' 
 Whether crack was in the house or record sales was through the ceiling 
 So say what you want, and do what you please 
 But for fun, I shoot 22's from your shoes to your knees 
 I run a record label and a crew of G's 
 So, niggaz'll come and look for you if ya sneeze 
 Or even breathe the wrong way, you better do what the song say 
 And be easy, or else it'll be a long day 
 You ain't Neva gotta ask again 
 How we got the world to listen 
 It ain't east to pretend 
 I know you lost your cool 
 And it statting to come back again 
 Wake and stop its just the beginning 
 You ain't never gotta ask again 
 Baby this is what we dodo 
 (Verse Four: Jay-Z) 
 They say an eye for an eye, we both lose our sight 
 And two wrongs don't make a right 
 But when you been wrong and you know all along that it's just one life 
 At what point does one fight? (Good question right!) 
 'Fore you knock the war, try to put your dogs in it 
 Ten-and-a-halfs, for a minute-and-a-half 
 Bet that stops all the grinnin and the laughs 
 When you play the game of life and the win ain't in the bag 
 When your options is none and the pen is all you have 
 Or the block, niggaz standin tight, there's limits on the ave 
 Tryin' to cop or shot-call theyself cleansin in the cash 
 But can't put they name on paper cause, then you on blast 
 Mr. President, there's drugs in our residence 
 Tell me what you want me to do, come break bread with us 
 Mr. Governor, I swear there's a cover up 
 Mr. Governor, I swear there's a cover up"

 Yeah 
 Yo... let me, let me, let me, let me tell you why - why 
 This nigga... why we dedicated this song to this kind of nigga 
 'Cause number one, duke is drivin' in the motherfuckin' projects 
 With a - with a Sebring, and with - with a rag off 
 Y'na'mean? Y-you not ballin' like that play-boy 
 Straight up, then the bitch you got playin' shotgun 
 Like, I used to serve that bitch, c'mon 
 Really really good, I mean and you gotta shirt and tie 
 You wack as nigga... 
 (Common) 
 Wack niggas... I don't even like to be around 'em 
 Give 'em dap or pound 'em 
 See 'em out they houndin' dawg 
 Singin' they got tracks for me to get down on 
 Singin' they hot when that shit don't even sound warm 
 Nigga I'm nasty, my style is sound porn 
 The graphic exposin' wack asses 
 I emcee as free as 'Ol Dirty Bastard 
 You think you Catholic tryin' to appeal to the masses 
 The Cassius Clay of rap today 
 Rock a beard like Castaway 
 You couldn't be dope for even half a day 
 We keep it hot like its after May 
 Smoke a nigga then I pass to K 
 (Kanye West) 
 The pastor say we goin' to mass today 
 We have to pray, these niggas is wack 'n' eh 
 I have to say, since Pac passed away 
 Most these niggas don't even deserve a track from me 
 First of all let's get rid of them Louis Vuitton boots 
 And get yo tall ass out that C Class coupe 
 Y'see the whiskAY had them girls feelin' friskAY 
 You was wit mAY (me) she said ""Who's the sissAY?"" 
 And even if they did wanna get bizzAY 
 Freaky like MissAY and roll the weed up 
 You would roll three blunts and fuck up three blunts 
 Motherfucka you a fuck up of free lunch, dawg 
 Just keep it right thurr like ChingAY 
 Yo girl don't like me how long has shee been gAY 
 Spanish girls tell ya ""No hable ingle"" 
 And everbody wanna run to me for they singlAY (single) 
 It's funny how these wack niggas need my help 
 Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself 
 Dawg, if I was you I wouldn't feel myself 
 Dawg, if I was you I'd kill myself 
 (HOOK - Kanye West (Singing Voice)) 
 (Wack nigga) Wake up in the morning dawg, and you a 
 (Wack nigga) I'd kill myself if I was that 
 (Wack nigga) Everything you wear and rock, is just 
 (Wack nigga) Even if you flossin' rocks you still 
 (Wack nigga) You can't do it dawg you's a 
 (Wack nigga) Bitin' ass, bitch ass, trick ass 
 (Wack nigga) Even your daughter says ""My daddy's a - "" 
 (Wack nigga - You wack nigga!) 
 (Consequence) 
 You know you wack when ya dawgs tell you 
 That's how you know ya flow is weak 
 'Cause you only got them there to 'Say Yes' like Floetry 
 The clique that I oversee ain't impressed by ya poetry 
 You're the place you're supposed to be 
 You ain't ain't comin' close to me 
 It ain't that you underrated 
 It's more thatn you're under dated 
 And mediocre at best is all the hoes you've ever dated 
 For all your guest appearances 
 You couldn't get the clearances 
 For them it's just a check they don't respect you as a lyricist 
 Look at what ya lyrics is, Murder, Death, Kill 
 But you never shot nothin', never have, never will 
 Better add on to ya skills before you join this round robin 
 Of super emcees that'll add to ya problems 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 In the beginnin', God created man in his own image 
 I'm 'bout to tell you how the story gon' finish 
 Kweli handle his business niggas don't forget it 
 'Cause a wiseman can shoose to get ignorant with it 
 Na'mean - you all can get it I'm conisdered the nicest 
 The way I spit it give these niggas all identity crisis 
 All day talkin' that shit like you hold a gat, right? 
 The trip you on must be short 'cause you pack light - act right 
 You got it twisted tellin' niggas that you pack heat 
 You ain't gunning now you runnin' like an athlete 
 You ballas need to quit rhymin' like Allen I've 
 Start speakin' New ?Wopian? and followin' Malachi 
 Oh, anything would rhyme, you need to sell drugs for real 
 Instead of on the radio, you'd be dead or in jail 
 All these thug niggas wanna rap 
 And all these rap niggas wanna thug 
 And all y'all fuckin' the game up 
 It's time to change up, my lyrics rip ya frame up 
 Askin' if I'm nice like fuckin' with a chick 
 Who don't give head - that's a no-brainer 
 Niggas back bangers you don't even know the names of 
 I'ma bout to meet my quota you about to meet ya Saviour 
 You wack nigga, you about to get shot 
 Fuck with Talib Kweli, that's how you get got 
 Not that I'm wylin' or even promote violence 
 It's just you're fuckin' up my high, can a nigga smoke in silence?!"

 You claim you got hoes but we can't tell 
 You claim you gettin' dough dawg we can't tell 
 You bought one pair of ones at a two-for-one sale 
 Politics catch me at the end of the mixtape 
 So I dropped my own ""Get Well Soon"" from mixtape 
 The drug game bolemic it's hard to get weight 
 So niggas' money is homo it's hard to get straight 
 I'm trynna do numbers like Pac did 
 But it ain't Shakur this the brand new Roc kid 
 Niggas wanna get me like they got BIG 
 'Cause I moved up out the city and got big 
 And that's the poison that runs through their veins and attack their soul and just start to tear 'em up 
 Niggas talk so muh shit about me in barbershops they forget to get their hair cut 
 Ok fair enough, the streets is flarin up 
 'Cause they want gun talk and I don't go there enough 
 But don't get it fucked up you can still get your head bust 
 I'm makin' wy too much dough to be playin' 
 And this is a classic in the making, history repeats itself 
 He do the rhymes and the beats himself 
 The only child syndrome make hits on hs own 
 And I'mma look in the mirror if I need some help 
 Y'all bout to blow man we can't tell 
 You claim you got hoes man we can't tell 
 You claim you gettin' dough nigga we can't tell 
 You bought one pair of ones at a two-for-one sale 
 I'm gettin' eyes by the case like Dirty 
 I made it to the Power 30 a whole hour early 
 I'mma pull out the shank and bang ya 
 I'mma cut a nigga up like LL trainer 
 This is the future of the Chi 
 This is the legacy of Twist, flickin Do or Die 
 So first of all who am I? (Who am I?) 
 My... my... my name is Kanye and that Cambridge 
 At home like Cambridge, look at what I came with? 
 No, none of that same shit that new and improved 
 And I don't know if me or how yellow my Roc-A-Fella chain is 
 But I'm so La smooth I ain't got nothin' to prove 
 You niggas bout blow dawg we can't tell 
 You claim you got hoes dawg we can't tell 
 You claim you gettin' dough nigga we can't tell

 Towel under the door, We smoke until the day's end 
 Puff puff and pass, don't fuck up rotation 
 Hpnotiq for Henny? Now nigga that's a chaser 
 Turn nuttin to somethin', now pimpin' that's a savior 
 Best things are green now pimpin' get your paper 
 High off the ground from stair to skyscraper 
 Cool off, thinkin' we local c'mon homey we major 
 (Kanye West) 
 We major? C'mon homey we major 
 We MAJOR?! C'mon homey we major 
 We major, c'mon homey we major 
 We major, c'mon 
 (Verse 1: Kanye West) 
 Feelin' better than some head on a Sunday afternoon 
 Better than a chick that say yes too soon 
 Until you have a daughter that's what I call karma 
 And you pray to God she don't grow breasts too soon 
 Projects to' up, gang signs is thrown up 
 Niggas hats broke off, that's how we grow up 
 Why else you think shorties write rhymes just to blow up? 
 Get they first car and then IRS show up 
 He ain't never had shit, but he had that 9 
 Nigga come through flickin and he had that shine 
 Put 2 and 2 together and a little bad weather 
 Gon' be your whole family on that funeral line 
 Asked the reverend was the strip clubs cool 
 If my tips helped send a pretty girl through school 
 That's all I want, like winos want they good whiskey 
 I ain't in the Klan but I brought my hood with me 
 (Nas) 
 We major? C'mon homey we major 
 We major? C'mon homey we major 
 We major! C'mon homey we major 
 We major! C'mon homey we major 
 (Verse 2: Nas) 
 I heard the beat and I ain't know what to write 
 First line should it be about the hoes or the ice? 
 Fo-fo's or Black Christ? Both flows'd be nice 
 Rap about big paper or the black man plight 
 At the studio console, asked my man to the right 
 What this verse sound like, should I freestyle or write? 
 He said, ""Nas what the fans want is Illmatic, Stillmatic"" 
 Looked at the pad and pen, fell, and jotted what I feel 
 Been like twelve years since a nigga first signed 
 Now I'm a free agent and I'm thinkin' it's time 
 To build my very own Motown 
 Cause rappers be deprived, of executive 9 to 5's 
 And it hurts to see these companies be stealin the life 
 And I love to give my blood sweat and tears to the mic 
 So y'all copped the LP's and y'all fiends got dealt 
 I'm Jesse Jackson on the balcony when King got killed 
 I survived the livest niggas around 
 Last longer than more than half of you clowns 
 Look, I used to cook before I had the game took 
 Either way my change came like Sam Cooke 
 (Singer) 
 Feeling better than I ever felt before today 
 Like better late than never is orientation 
 Still we can make it better throwing all your cares away 
 (Tony Williams) 
 Feeling better than I ever felt before today 
 But better late than never, it's 
 Orien-tation, still we can make it better 
 Throwin' all your cares away 
 [Kanye] + (Nas) 
 We major? (C'mon homey we major) 
 We MAJOR?! (C'mon homey we major) 
 We major (C'mon homey we major) 
 We major 
 (Tony Williams) 
 Feeling better than I ever felt before today 
 But better late than never, it's 
 Orien-tation, still we can make it better 
 Throwin' all your cares away 
 (Music starts to fade until 5:21 in the song) 
 (Verse 3: Kanye West) 
 Can I talk my shit again? 
 Can I talk my shit again?! 
 I can't believe I'm back up in this muh'fucker 
 I'mma be late though 
 I gotta figure out what I'm gonna wear 
 Yeah... the Roc is definitely in the building 
 Good music's definitely in the building 
 I gotta say what's up to Tony Williams 
 On the vocals sings, he sings quite beautifully 
 Don't you agree? Don't you agree? 
 Uh, and Jon Brion on the keys right now 
 And Warren Campbell on the keys right now 
 So they ask me - why you call it Late Registration 'Ye? 
 'Cause we takin' these muh'fuckers back to school 
 If you know this part right here, feel free to sing along 
 [Outro: Tony Williams] + (Kanye West) 
 Feeling better than I ever felt before today (If you feelin' good) 
 But better late than never; it's orien-tation (It's orientation) 
 Still we can make it better 
 Throwin' all your cares away... (We want you to get used to this) 
 (Uh, they cain't do what we do baby) 
 (Uh-uh, uh-uh, they cain't do what we do baby) 
 (Uh-uh, uh-uh, they cain't do what we do baby) 
 (Yeah...)"

 Harlem back be all right, Fo' Reel be all right, Ma$e is back be all right

 Ma$e said c'mon, Mike said chamone 
 Started it up early up like Ravon Simone

 Drop out of school wit no manual 
 Nottin' hand a dude, did I complain 
 Everytime magazines try to take my name 
 But y'all can't hold me down like a restrain 
 I took the T out the word can't 
 'Round same time when Nas said I can 
 Bush sendin' our fam to Iran 
 I'm in the club with a henny ass in my other hand 
 Lord please just forgive me I'm just a man 
 Right now I'm trying to make some adjustments 
 Before do me like Janet to just and them 
 Me and my couz and them 
 Trying to rap like bust and and them 
 My clothes were bust than a bummy 
 I neva, eva accept money from these so call sponsors 
 They were in Benz and I in Hondas 
 Now I wonder why they all actin' like Anada 
 Ummm... yeah... that something to ponder 
 The money I make for donda 
 That's west to you, you the next 
 I holdin' my breath for you 
 What you need to do is turn up some decibels 
 You need to put dome of them zero in front of them decimals

 Arm frozen arm, dorn on so in nawn 
 Macerate for guy rose in on 
 Different color go weey for toes and all 
 I try to tell the chick do exposed it all 
 Country dudes mouth full gold and all 
 Bay area chick, cornrows and all 
 I do it right, I do my wife 
 Leave the hoes for all of ya 
 From the boutique, I might close the mall 
 I drink my Geico and turn it Gecko 
 I waive Rol-ey, you waive Seiko, need say mo' 
 More diamond than Lisa Ray 
 I know the recipica, I'm the DNA 
 'Gree school, leave you like hurricane 
 Somebody get kill, the whole barrow bling 
 M.A. dollar that's a theoral name 
 No matter who comes 
 I'm forever the king 
 I should neva left the game, what a cutie said 
 Still trick blowing my up like newly wed 
 I'm grown and sexy, young groupie head 
 Milk white panther seat, woupie red 
 I drop my cars in pairs like titties pat 
 When I'm done with this track, feel like biggie back 
 The game is country 
 I came to bring the city back 
 I came, I came to bring the city back 
 (Outro: Ma$e) 
 Fo Reel put your hands up 
 Good Music put your hands up 
 Bad Boy put your hans up

 Ay, ay, y'all know we poppin' wheely shit. Let's see who's really rich. 
 Yeah I ride the beat, I'm bout to pop a wheely bitch. Really this, I came up with on some silly shit. Look how good it is that show you who you're dealin' with. Y'all illi I'm iller, I'm from Illinois. Yo Big Shaun why don't you call ya Chi-Town boys. Show me where they at I will destroy you. 'Bout to fuck somethin' up I might as well call the lawyer. Good music run this bitch, yes we do. I know you think that damn I wish shay would bless me too. In the bull fight, in the restroom, it's best you go 'head and kiss the Jesus piece, 'cause I just blessed you. Uh, in holy water Issac gave Shay a slaughter, ever since the day that I opened up that midnight marauder. Now it's gon be ya problem like a brand new installment from the late great Mr. Christopher Wallace. They call us pompous, can I be honest? Honestly modesty wasn't ever in my policy. Apology accepted, you ain't sayin', shoulda said it. As soon as I did it all that bullshit was dead it. Get it?"
260,Kanye West,hiphop,Where You At?,"(Verse 1: Kanye West) 
 Yeah, yeah - I used to front when I write songs 
 Talk about havin' ice on, and I could barely keep my lights on 
 And my beats was so sick, I shoulda got a medic 
 But my credit was so pathetic I couldn't afford a debit 
 When the dropout dropped, I had to cop me a money tree 
 To front on anybody who ever tried to front on me 
 With so much personality, what do you want from me? 
 I could be by myself and enjoy the company 
 My life, this year, my career, is the Lord 
 Bad chick, this award, is for Melissa Ford 
 Ninety-four I could only afford this Accord 
 From the home of gangbangin and we all outdoors 
 Southside, outside, Westside, let's ride 
 Eastside, right B-Side, Lakeshore Drive 
 And I'm (and I'm) Chi-Town's finest 
 Where you at? The whole city behind us 
 (Chorus: Kanye West) 
 Where you at? The whole city behind us 
 Where you at? The whole city behind us 
 Southside, outside, Westside, let's ride 
 Where you at? The whole city behind us 
 (Verse 2: Ludacris) 
 It ain't nuttin to it but to do it! I came here 
 To shut the place down till my body stops pumpin red fluid 
 A-Town I've been through it! And we steady gettin' tested 
 But ready to fill your bubble when we put the lead to it 
 Out West they still bangin', up top it's really gully 
 Down South we get buck and turn hearts to Silly Putty 
 Ludacris I got silly money - you got jokes? 
 I'll be laughin' all the way to the bank - now that's really funny! 
 Big city bright lights - and many pity 'cause we like fights 
 May be long days but it's fright nights 
 Living out the night life - and people asking 'Where You At?' 
 Not the club; I stay in the get right! 
 Hotlanta home of the booties and the really tight skirts 
 Where if somebody moves then somebody gets hurt! 
 From Decatur down to CP, and EP 
 Adamsville to the battlefield it's D.T.P. 
 (Verse 3: The Game) 
 It's Compton's prodigy 
 Obviously I'm from the home of hydraulics 
 Where they tie bandanas around the steerin collar 
 'Nuff Impalas in to get holla 
 We fightin pitbulls and Rottweilers 
 In the projects the objective is make dollars 
 'Where You At?' It ain't a problem to get it there by tomorrow 
 'Cause I got a female friend, with frequent flier mileage 
 I ain't never been to college got the IQ of a Rhodes Scholar 
 If you follow G-Unit throw up your dubs and yell holla 
 To all the Y.G.'s in khakis and white tees 
 With And 1's in every colour like Ice-T 
 I might be the city of Compton's right knee 
 The way I paint pictures with these hip-hop scriptures 
 Pay attention while The Game shine like a prism 
 Glisten, show you how canaries can alter one's vision 
 Not to mention I am Dr. Dre christened on behalf 
 Of Luda and Kan-Yeezie, I'm gon' breathe easy 
 (Chorus] - repeat 2X)"
261,Kanye West,hiphop,White Dress,"Just me and you girl 
 Whoa oh 
 Just me and you girl 
 Whoa oh 
 Trying to sneak upstairs to your apartment 
 Aren't you a sight for red eyes 
 I just flew in and slipped in on your left side 
 Just a satin gown, you asleep with no make-up 
 I'm just tryna be inside you 'fore you wake up 
 Just me and you girl 
 Whoa oh 
 We had problems but it's all in the past 
 Everybody got problems baby, algebra class 
 Remember I used to do things that'd make you laugh 
 Like orderin' a girl drink in a masculine glass 
 You like piña coladas, getting caught in the rain 
 Or rocking flannels all summer like Kurt Cobain 
 Or that Dolce Gabbana with a few gold chains 
 And you the type of girl that probably deserve a new last name 
 But, they never let us do our thing 
 Everybody lying on who I bang 
 We was on fire but they blew our flame 
 Ain't no denying baby you have changed 
 Cause now your high heels clicking, your lip gloss glisten 
 Your hips start switching, you're pissed off, tripping 
 Cause even when we're kissing baby girl feel different 
 Friends all diss him like, ""No he didn't? 
 No he didn't, is you talking about Kitten? 
 Is that bitch still stripping? 
 Trying to get a pair of Christians?"" 
 I swear to God that they got you going crazy 
 But you play it off and say, ""How is work baby?"" 
 Well some of the models is too coked up to walk straight 
 But seem to still love the man that they all hate 
 But babe I call you back and say that you say that always 
 And kept me on the phone and demanded they all wait 
 See, she knew about all my lies the whole time 
 And my credit's so bad I can't get no one to cosign 
 I would've thought she would've bust in the door cryin' 
 But she upped and left a nigga and she ain't give me no sign 
 Now, she back in the club in a tight dress 
 With dreams of someday wearing a white dress 
 Seen with some lame, it's a miracle that she'd 
 Talk to a nigga with a ten-year ago swag 
 Plus I don't like none of her girlfriends 
 Quote unquote, ""Cause her girlfriends got girlfriends."" 
 On the phone, hollin' that ""niggas is whatever"" 
 Let's fly to Euro and make this the best summer ever 
 Now she heading to Rome, Rome is the home 
 Rome is where she act like she ain't got no fucking phone 
 I accept that I was wrong, except a nigga grown 
 So I can't bitch and moan, in a session gettin' stoned 
 So a nigga had to hop on a plane 
 A bus and a train, to try to come and talk and explain 
 Rented the whole bottom floor for a candlelight dinner 
 Turned the lights out and put my candle right in her 
 And told her, ""Even though I met you in a club in a tight dress 
 At first sight I could picture you in a white dress."" 
 Thirty foot train, diamond from Lorraine 
 Just to make up for all the years and the pain 
 Family on both sides, I'm so glad you came 
 Aunty couldn't make it, oh no that's a shame 
 Wedding in June, what could be better? 
 Let's fly to Euro, make this the best summer ever 
 Take the very last car of the Eurostar 
 Tell the conductor, ""Just drive so far"" 
 Told some of your friends and they wasn't excited 
 Well we gon' tour the countryside and they won't be invited 
 We will not be disturbed by the fussin' and fighting 
 Tell Peaches light the herb 'cause we just reunited 
 Let's make a move from these herds, go somewhere in private 
 I'm talking just me and you and the plane and the pilot 
 Just me and you girl 
 Whoa oh 
 Just me and you girl 
 Whoa oh"

 For you, baby, I'd find you 
 For you, baby, I'd find you 
 For you, baby, I'd find you 
 I done been around the world, been around the block 
 Been around hos that fucked Biggie and Pac 
 Like Vida Guerra 
 Ass took her to the top 
 She'll give you some brains 
 You let her throw up the Roc 
 Let her put on your chain, she'll throw you some cock 
 Picture that, like Megan Good and Jamie Foxx 
 Hype said ""It's a wrap,"" she still on the set 
 Puttin' oil on her legs, like she Gloria Velez 
 She was eye candy in the Double X-L 
 Hopped off the page and on the skateboard with Pharrell 
 I knew she (wouldn't get far) 
 'Cause five hundred dollars can't get you that (far) 
 How you get that (far)? 
 And all these new video bitches tryin' be Melyssa Ford 
 But they don't know Melyssa Ford drive a Honda Accord 
 She a video vixen, but behind close doors 
 She do whatever it take to get to the Grammy Awards

 Fuckin' them rap stars 
 You know who you are

 Nigga, that's mad nuts 
 Game, you mad nuts 
 How you gonna call out all these 
 Bitches knowin' damn well they gonna call me? 
 The only dream of the ghetto prom queen 
 Was to make it to the screen, maybe get seen 
 Maybe get chose by a nigga from a team 
 Head so good, he don't ask for a prenup' 
 Now ask your self this question, uh 
 Would you be with Jay-Z if he wasn't C-E-O? 
 Would you be with F-A-B-O if he drove an E-O? 
 Would you ride with Ne-Yo if he was in a Geo? 
 Well, why the hell you think these bitches comin' at me for? 
 But since they all fall in my palm, I'll take a trio

 (For you, baby, I'd find you) 
 (For you, baby, I'd find you) 
 For you, and you 
 For all y'all 
 I done have my share of bitches with long hair 
 Short 'do like Kelis, a Halle, and boomerang, yeah 
 I been around the block in a Bentley, drop top 
 On Miami Beach, when Lil' Kim was fuckin' with Scott 
 I got the scoop on Hoops, whatever the case 
 She let you spray in her face as long as you Bathin' Apes 
 And ain't nobody tryin' to take Beyonce from Jay 
 But I know a bitch named Super Head, fucked back in the day 
 The things niggas do when pussy sittin' on they face 
 Stab you in the stomach 
 She must a had a pussy like Wonder Woman 
 On that superhero shit, fly as Gabrielle Union 
 In the back off my six, fo' Impala 
 Forget the double D's, I put 'em right in your face 
 Like that model bitch De Cara 
 And she ain't win the show, but she ridin' in that Gelatta 
 That's why I fuck 'em today then forget 'em tomorrow 
 (You wouldn't get far, far, far) 
 Fuckin' them rap stars 
 You know who you are 
 Put your hands up, ladies 
 (You wouldn't get far) 
 If you kept your legs closed 
 (It would be just a waste of time) 
 But you know 
 (You wouldn't get far, far, far) 
 Fuckin' them rap stars 
 You know who you are 
 I wrote this song for you 
 (For you, baby, I'd find you) 
 (For you, baby, I'd find you) 
 For you, and you 
 For all y'all 
 God damn, you know what I'm sayin'? 
 I was sittin' back and watchin' Kanye video 
 And I see the same bitch that was in the homeboy Busta Rhyme's video 
 Then I flipped the motherfuckin' channel, checkin' out my uncle Snoop Dogg's video 
 And I see the same bitch that was in MY video 
 You know what I'm sayin'? 
 And then, you know what I'm sayin', to make that even more fucked up 
 I'm watchin' Oprah coverin' Hurricane Katrina 
 I see the same bitch on Oprah, floatin' away on the hood of a Camry 
 That was in the nigga Lil' Weezy video 
 I mean, damn! Everywhere I look, everywhere I go, I see the same hos 
 Don't get mad, I'm only bein' real, yeah"

269,Kanye West,hiphop,Wow,"I go to Jacob wit 25 thou, you go wit 25 hundred, WoW 
 I got eleven plaques on my wall right now 
 You got your first gold single damn nigga, WoW 
 H to the Izzo did 3 thou spins in a week 
 You get a thou in a month, WoW 
 Y'all niggas want credit but y'all need to slow down 
 Kanye to the killin' y'all from Chi-town, how your wife gon say 
 She never sold drugs a day in her life, but she still wanna pump the Ye 
 And y'all mad 'cause y'all not knowin', 'cause these canaries so yellow 
 When y'all pull up whether to stop or keep goin' 
 I got G's, rock Rock 'n' Roll tees wit no sleeves 
 Tats showin, tucked in strap showin 
 How he get seven TV's in that 'lac 'lac 
 3 in the front, 2 in the back, 2 in that back, back 
 While you in that hatchback 
 And tryin' to sell work and don't get shit from them packs back 
 And try to rap, the studios wont give you ya daps back 
 And try to get publishin, all you get in your ass capped 
 And that's that 
 Magazines call me a rock star, bitches call me cock star 
 Billboard pop star, neighborhood block star 
 Chi-town go-getting pimps, we mob-stars 
 Gingerbread man even says ""You're a monster"" 
 Remember that, uh-huh, that's that trek shit 
 Remember back in '92 niggas used to catch reck shit 
 Remember that track I tracked for you bout 3 months ago 
 Uh-huh that's the one, now cut my check bitch 
 And I ain't feelin' that Lexus or that CLK 
 See me like damn ""A C L K?"" 
 Yeah that's how we eatin and, keep us looking peace and then 
 I ain't know we rap as good as he do beats and then 
 H to the Izzo did 3 thou spins in a week

 Kanye to the killin' y'all from Chi-town"
270,Kanye West,hiphop,Ye Vs. The People,"I had for us 
 You turned my dreams into dust 
 I watch a phone that, I had for us 
 You turned my dreams into dust 
 I know Obama was Heaven-sent 
 But ever since Trump won, it proved that I could be President 
 Yeah, you can, at what cost though? 
 Don't that go against the teachings that Ye taught for? 
 Yo, Tip, I hear your side and everybody talk, though 
 But ain't goin' against the grain everything I fought for? 
 Prolly so, Ye, but where you tryna go with this? 
 It's some shit you just don't align with and don't go against 
 You just readin' the headlines, you don't see the fine print 
 You on some choosin'-side shit, I'm on some unified shit 
 It's bigger than your selfish agenda 
 If your election ain't gon' stop police from murderin' niggas, then shit... 
 Bruh, I never ever stopped fightin' for the people 
 Actually, wearin' the hat'll show people that we equal 
 You gotta see the vantage point of the people 
 What makes you feel equal makes them feel evil 
 See that's the problem with this damn nation 
 All Blacks gotta be Democrats, man, we ain't made it off the plantation 
 Fuck who you choose as your political party 
 You representin' dudes just seem crude and cold-hearted 
 With blatant disregard for the people who put you in position 
 Don't you feel an obligation to them? 
 I feel a obligation to show people new ideas 
 And if you wanna hear 'em, there go two right here 
 Make America Great Again had a negative perception 
 I took it, wore it, rocked it, gave it a new direction 
 Added empathy, care and love and affection 
 And y'all simply questionin' my methods 
 What you willin' to lose for the point to be proved? 
 This shit is stubborn, selfish, bullheaded, even for you 
 You wore a dusty-ass hat to represent the same views 
 As white supremacy, man, we expect better from you 
 All them times you sounded crazy, we defended you, homie 
 Not just to be let down when we depend on you, homie 
 That's why it's important to know what direction you're goin' now 
 'Cause everything that you built can be destroyed and torn down 
 You think I ain't concerned about how I affect the past? 
 I mean, that hat stayed in my closet like 'bout a year and a half 
 Then one day I was like, ""Fuck it, I'ma do me"" 
 I was in the sunken place and then I found the new me 
 Not worried about some image that I gotta keep up 
 Lot of people agree with me, but they're too scared to speak up 
 The greater good of the people is first 
 Have you considered all the damage and the people you hurt? 
 You had a bad idea, and you're makin' it worse 
 This shit's just as bad as Catholic preachers rapin' in church 
 Y'all been leadin' with hate, see I just approach it different 
 Like a gang truce, the first Blood to shake the Crip's hand 
 I know everybody emotional 
 Is it better if I rap about crack? Huh? 'Cause it's cultural? 
 Or how about I'ma shoot you, or fuck your bitch? 
 Or how about all this Gucci, 'cause I'm fuckin' rich? 
 You'll deal with God for the lack of respect 
 Startin' to make it seem like Donnie cut you a check 
 Now you toyin' with hot lava, better be careful with that 
 What's it mean to gain the world if you ain't standin' for shit? 
 Okay I gotta say it, Ye, you sound high as a bitch 
 Yeah, genocide and slavery, we should just try and forget 
 And all that free thought shit, find a better defense 
 But if Ye just stuck in his way, he can leave it at that 
 Fuck it 
 Alright, Tip, we could be rappin' about this all day, man, why don't we just cut the beat off and let the people talk?"
