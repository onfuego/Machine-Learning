23,Rage Against The Machine,rock,Intro (Black Steel In The Hour Of Chaos),"I got a letter from the government 
 The other day 
 I opened and read it 
 It said they were suckers 
 They wanted me for their army or whatever 
 Picture me givin' a damn - I said never 
 Here is a land that never gave a damn 
 About a brother like me and myself 
 Because they never did 
 I wasn't wit' it, but just that very minute... 
 It occurred to me 
 The suckers had authority 
 Cold sweatin' as I dwell in my cell 
 How long has it been? 
 They got me sittin' in the State Pen 
 I gotta get out - but that thought was thought before 
 I contemplated a plan on the cell floor 
 I'm not a fugitive on the run 
 But a brother like me begun - to be another one 
 Public enemy servin' time - they drew the line y'all 
 To criticize me for some crime - nevertheless 
 They could not understand that I'm a black man 
 And I could never be a veteran 
 On the strength, the situation's unreal 
 I got a raw deal, Zack 
 So I'm goin' for the steel"

 On January 1st, 1994 
 The indigenous farmers of Southern Mexico 
 Declared war on an unjust 
 And illegitimate government 
 Out of the depths of the most wild, the most poor 
 Came a just arms struggle 
 For democracy, justice and liberty 
 And it won't stop until that

 The Partido Revolucionario Institucional is buried in the ground and 
 The people's voice is heard once again. 
 Yeah 
 So check it out 
 On January 1st of '94 they became known as the Zapatista movement

 To uh, Fraternal Order of Police in Philadelphia. 
 Here's something nice and friendly, 
 Here's something nice and friendly, 
 Here's something nice and friendly, 
 And it goes something like this. 
 Fuck tha police, 
 Comin' straight from the underground. 
 Young nigga got it bad 'cause I'm brown, 
 And not the other color so police think, 
 They have the authority to kill a minority. 
 Fuck that shit, 'cause I ain't tha one, 
 For a punk mutha fucka with a badge and a gun, 
 To be beatin' on, and throwin' in jail. 
 We could go toe to toe in the middle of a cell. 
 Fuckin' with me 'cause I'm a teenager, 
 With a little bit of gold and a pager. 
 Searchin my car, lookin' for the product. 
 Thinkin' every nigga is sellin narcotics. 
 You'd rather see me in the pen, 
 Then me and Lorenzo chilling in the Benzo. 
 Beat tha police outta shape, 
 And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape, 
 To mark off the scene of the slaughter. 
 No controller, bread and water. 
 A young nigga on a warpath, 
 And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath, 
 Of cops, dyin' in L. A. 
 Yo, I got somethin' to say. 
 Fuck the police, 
 Comon! Off, What? 
 Fuck the police, 
 Yeah! 
 Comon! 
 Fuck tha police,

 To mark off the scene of the slaughter. 
 No controller, bread and water. 
 I don't know if they fags or what, 
 Search a nigga down and grabbin in the nuts. 
 And on the other hand, without a gun they can't get none. 
 But don't let it be a black and a white one. 
 'Cause they slam ya down to the street top, 
 Black police showin out for the white cop. 
 Yeah, my brothas will swarm, 
 On any mutha fucka in a blue uniform. 
 Just 'cause we in Washington D.C, punk police are afraid of me. 
 Hey! 
 Punk on a warpath, 
 And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath, 
 Of cops, dyin' in L. A. 
 Hey yo, We got somethin' to say. 
 Fuck the police,

 Right now,

27,Rage Against The Machine,rock,Darkness Of Greed,"Greed 
 Causing innocent blood to flow 
 Entire culture, lost in the overthrow 
 They came to seize and take whatever they please 
 Then all they gave back was death and disease 
 My people were left with no choice but to decide 
 To conform to a system, responsible for genocide 
 Responsible for genocide 
 Responsible for genocide 
 AIDS is killing the entire African nation 
 And a vaccine is still supposedly under preparation 
 But these governments, they don't mind the procrastination 
 They say ""We'll kill them off, take their land and go there for vacation"" 
 My people's culture was strong, it was pure 
 And if not for that white greed, it would've endured 
 My people were left with no choice but to decide 
 To conform to a system 
 Their minds enslaved, their souls encaged 
 I feel the rage 
 Its brutality can never be undone 
 But the sun is not yet set 
 The bass and drums and microphones a threat 
 That's when ya investigate the crimes from the inside 
 And see that they're responsible for genocide 
 Responsible for genocide 
 Responsible for genocide 
 You jam your culture down my throat 
 Say I'm inferior when I find that I choke 
 Ya fill my mind with a false sense of history 
 And then you wonder why I have no identity? 
 Well, I'll strike a match and it'll catch and 
 Spread the insight we need 
 A tiny fire, burning bright 
 Shedding light on the darkness of greed 
 A yes yes y'all, and ya don't stop 
 Shedding light on the darkness of greed 
 A yes yes y'all, and ya don't stop 
 Shedding light on the darkness of greed"

 He's goin' someplace and there's no turnin' back 
 The Highway Patrol chopper comin' up over the ridge 
 Man sleeps by a campfire under the bridge 
 The shelter line stretchin' around the corner 
 Welcome to the New World Order 
 Families sleepin' in their cars out in the southwest 
 No job, no home, no peace, no rest 
 No rest 
 And the highway is alive tonight 
 Nobody's foolin' nobody as to where it goes 
 I'm sitting down here in the campfire light 
 Searchin' for the ghost of Tom Joad 
 He pulls his prayer book out of a sleepin' bag 
 The preacher lights up a bud and takes a drag 
 He's waitin' for the time when the last shall be first and the first shall be last 
 In a cardboard box 'neath the underpass 
 With a one way ticket to the promised land 
 With a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand 
 Lookin' for a pillow of solid rock 
 Bathin' in the cities' aqueducts 
 Rock 
 And the highway is alive tonight 
 Nobody's foolin' nobody as to where it goes 
 I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light 
 With the ghost of old Tom Joad 
 Now Tom Said; ""Ma, whenever ya see a cop beatin' a guy 
 Wherever a hungry newborn baby cries 
 Wherever there's a fight against the blood and hatred in the air 
 Look for me ma, I'll be there. 
 Wherever somebody's strugglin' for a place to stand 
 For a decent job or a helpin' hand 
 Wherever somebody is strugglin' to be free 
 Look in their eyes ma, you'll see me 
 You'll see me 
 You'll see me 
 You'll see me 
 You'll see me 
 You'll see me 
 You'll see me 
 You'll see me 
 You'll see me!"" 
 Rock 
 And the highway is alive tonight 
 Nobody's foolin' nobody as to where it goes 
 I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light

 Like Chief Sitting Bull, Tom Paine 
 Doctor Martin Luther King, Malcolm X 
 They were renegades of their time and age 
 So many renegades 
 We're the Renegades of Funk 
 We're the Renegades of Funk 
 We're the Renegades of Funk 
 We're the Renegades of Funk 
 From a different solar system many many galaxies away 
 We are the force of another creation 
 A new musical revelation 
 And we're on this musical mission to help the others listen 
 And groove from land to land singing electronic chants like 
 Zulu nation 
 Revelation 
 Destroy all nations 
 Destroy all nations 
 Destroy all nations 
 Destroy all nations 
 Destroy all nations 
 Destroy all nations 
 Now renegades are people with their own philosophies 
 They change the course of history 
 Everyday people like you and me 
 We're the renegades, we're the people with our own philosophies 
 We change the course of history 
 Everyday people like you and me c'mon! 
 We're the Renegades of Funk 
 We're the Renegades of Funk 
 We're the Renegades of Funk 
 We're the Renegades of Funk 
 We're poppin', sockin', rockin' put a side of hip-hop 
 Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin' 
 Poppin', sockin', rockin' put a side of hip-hop 
 Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin' 
 Poppin', an' sockin', an' rockin', an puttin' a side of hip-hop 
 Because we're, poppin', sockin', rockin' put a side of hip-hop 
 Poppin', sockin', rockin' put a side of hip-hop 
 We're the Renegades of Funk 
 We're the Renegades of Funk 
 We're the Renegades of Funk 
 We're the Renegades of Funk 
 We're teachers of the funk 
 And not of empty popping 
 We're blessed with the Force and the sight of electronics 
 With the bass, and the treble 
 The horns and our vocals 
 'Cause every time we pop into the beat we get fresh 
 C'mon 
 There was a time when our music 
 Was something called the big street beat 
 People would gather from all around 
 To get down to the big sound 
 You had to be a renegade those days 
 To take a man on the dance floor 
 Say jam sucka (jam sucka) 
 Say jam sucka (jam sucka) 
 Say groove, sucka (groove sucka) 
 Now groove, sucka (groove sucka) 
 Say dance, sucka (dance sucka)

 A brother got ill and tried to snatch a fat cable 
 I stepped back, like it wasn't no thing 
 I punched him in the jaw with the fat gold ring 
 I had an ace in the hole when it came to that 
 Yo Z you was packin'? You know was strapped 
 Posse kept rollin' it was hard to get with 'em 
 So I stepped back, and unbuttoned my Lee denim 
 They kept coming, just like I figured 
 So I stepped back, and started sprayin niggaz 
 What a way to go out, out like a sucker 
 But I'm on track, like a Long Island train 
 That can head up your mission, suckers who be dissing 
 Always on my jock like a snake always hissing 
 Grabbing and tapping me like Luther Vandross 
 Take me to the bar for the drink and make a toast 
 Givin' best wishes to the best MC

 Gimme the cue, check one two 
 Don't try to come off on me, because you doo-doo 
 You treatin me the Z to the D, like a stepchild 
 Let me tell you homeboy you're livin' foul 
 MC's, you know who you are 
 On the bandwagon Why Z? 'Cause you a star 
 This is the year when the joker's are wild 
 When a fag can't hack it and try to bite your style 
 I get hip to the scheme, before it happens 
 If it gets wild, then I start cappin 
 But for now, since everything's calm 
 Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb

 Time for some action 
 Just a fraction of friction 
 I got the clearance 
 To run the interference 
 Into your satellite 
 Shining a battle light 
 Sen got the gatt and I know that he'll gatt you right

 Just a little sample 
 How I could just kill a man

 Take my chrome

 Take cover son or you're assed-out

 Didn't have to blast him but I did anyway

 One of the many missions that I have to establish 
 To light

 So if you ain't down, bullshit! 
 Say some punk tried to get you for your auto 
 Would you call the One-time and play the role model? 
 No! I think you'll play like a thug 
 Next hear the shot of a magnum slug 
 Humming coming at ya 
 Yeah ya know I'm gonna gatt ya! 
 How you know where I'm at when you haven't been where I've been? 
 Understand where I'm coming from 
 When you're up on the hill in your big home 
 I'm out here risking my dome 
 Just for a bucket 
 Or a fast ducat 
 Just to stay alive, yo I got to say ""fuck it!""

 He didn't learn and wanted children 
 Said, ""What is there left to stay alive for?"" 
 He doesn't wanna see it... 
 He didn't wanna deal with it 
 Here they come, feelings that come as natural 
 Whatever left, he considered a loss, y'all 
 He doesn't wanna see it... 
 Running away, getting some kinda cure 
 ""What is there left to keep him alive?"" she said 
 Give him your love, give him your love to save him 
 Give him your love, give him your love to save him

 Suicide or a slower death from addiction

60,Rage Against The Machine,rock,Memory Of The Dead,"Wealthy vampires 
 With the cold hands of executioners 
 Execute 
 Executive decisions 
 Determined to destroy 
 What 1 million women, children, and men 
 1910 
 Died, drowning in the rage of battle. 
 Mothers, half naked 
 Infants clutching their necks 
 Running frantically 
 Tripping over the bodies of their sons 
 Teeth gnashing 
 Swinging machete 
 Spitting blood and mud, and screaming: 
 Land, and liberty! 
 Were erased. 
 Buried and burned 
 Along with the memory of the dead 
 Along with the ejido. 
 With the smooth stroke of a pen 
 And with the ghost of nixon present in their eyes 
 They smiled. 
 And pronounced the omnipitence 
 Of the free market 
 The profits of profit 
 Extending the scurge of columbus and pizarro 
 The freedom to buy things you can never afford 
 The freedom for indians to buy corn that once flourished overgrown in their backyards 
 The freedom to die of curable disease 
 The freedom to watch their children's stomachs swell and burst 
 The freedom to starve and die 
 Without land 
 Or liberty 
 But ramona, with eyes of obsidian 
 Peering through her blood and sweat drenched mask 
 Darding, unseen 
 Changing direction with the swiftness of a bird 
 Through the shanty's of the canyon 
 With every coyote, every insect, every phylum of life 
 Urging her, propelling her forward. 
 The leaves and branches of the forest 
 Part for miles, clearing her path 
 The voices and screams of the dead beneathe her feet 
 Echo in the deepest chasm of her soul 
 Hurling her, toward the city 
 History surging through her veins 
 Pulsing through her fingers 
 Hurling her, towards the city 
 She caresses her trigger 
 And the words of magome fulfil her being 
 And with each shot she fires, she affirms her movement 
 Saying: 
 Enough! enough! 
 No! 
 I will see my own blood flow 
 Before you take my land... or my liberty"

 Afternoon 
 No room for love and emptiness 
 By a freeway 
 I confess I was lost in the pages 
 I'm a book 
 Full of death 
 Reading how we'll die alone 
 If a god will lay to rest 
 Anywhere we want to go 
 In your eyes 
 I long to be 
 Room by room 
 Patiently 
 I wait for you there 
 Like a stone 
 I wait for you there 
 Alone 
 On my death bed 
 I'm afraid to look gods early angels 
 Like a pagen to anyone who will take me to heaven 
 To a place 
 I would call 
 I was here so long ago 
 The sky was froze 
 The world was black 
 And they led me on 
 In your eyes 
 I long to be 
 Room by room 
 Patiently 
 I wait for you there 
 Like a stone 
 I wait for you there 
 Alone 
 Alone 
 In all I read 
 Till the day was gone 
 And I felt in regret 
 In all the things that I've done 
 For all that I've blessed 
 And all that I've wronged 
 And dreams until my dead 
 I would roam the world

 Let the water form a cry 
 Only better luck should greet you 
 The road should rise to meet you

 KRS-1 coming through... Big Zack... Last Emperor 
 Woo! Woo!...that's the sound of EMS... 
 (Ha Ha!)...Last Emperor, KRS... 
 (Ha Ha!)...Big Zack you know the rest... 
 Now we gonna come down like this now, hold tight, all crew... LISTEN! 
 This voice shatters the calm of the day like an alarm 
 So wake up bright anew; and take up arms 
 'Cause more is necessary than vocabulary war 
 'Cause the toxic rock import's hitting on your door 
 C.I.A. I'll see you later; 'cause your time is coming soon 
 I'll flip the shit like Pacino in a Dark Dog Day Afternoon 
 Attica! Attica!, drug agents you bring your statica 
 My alphabet will slash and then can flip you automatica, dramatic; 
 Like Ali Shaheed Mohammed* brought the vibe 
 I'll bring the sun at red dawn upon the thoughts that Frantz Fanon 
 So stand at attention devil dirch; 
 You'll never survive choosing sides against the wretched of the earth 
 The infiltrator 
 Child intoxicator 
 People incarcerator 
 Liberation movement annhilator 
 We got you ... pushing rocks and it failed 
 We got brothers trooping subways like the Ho Chi Ming trail 
 We got the truth daddy, Last Emperor, KRSin' history's manifestin' 
 Tomorrow's next lesson. 
 You claim I'm selling' crack; but you be doing that (2X) 
 You know the cops they got a network for the toxic rock! 
 You claim I'm selling' crack; but you be doing that 
 So get that flashlight outta my face! 
 You claim I'm selling' crack; but you be doing that 
 The Last Emperor, KRS-ONE and big Zack 
 As free market, capitalism and technology expands 
 The third world's fertile soil becomes a dessert wasteland 
 So it takes fans to demand the government provide answers 
 When Lady Liberty has me bewitched like Samantha, 
 And poverty is one of the most malignant forms of cancer 
 To all my black magic romancers and acid rain dancers, 
 Develop close ties like Jerry Seinfeld and George Costanza 
 We fear no man and throw jams that attack Counter Intelligence Programs 
 Exiting like the epic adventures of Conan, 
 I colonize minds like Zaire by the Belgians 
 Now what hell is the problem with this system and what it sells us 
 I break the aincient ... billets like Wycleff did the zealots 
 I saw an iron curtain called Hip-Hop and got it opened like Boris Yeltsen 
 Whirlwinds, tornadoes and the rain forest if you say so, 
 KRS and the last Emperor roll like the Green Hornet and Kato 
 Zack De La Rocha brings the enraged flow; 
 But all three drop science and become the most powerful alliance since N.A.T.O. 
 Need I say the C.I.A. be criminals in action 
 Cocaine, crack unpackin' high surveillance trackin', 
 Prominent blacks and whites giving orders for mass slaughters 
 I want all my daughters to be like Maxine Waters 
 When they flooded the streets with crack/cocaine I was like Noah 
 Now they lower 'cause the whole Cold War is over 
 Communism fell to the dollars you were grabbin & 
 All the assault and battering; in the name of Intelligence gathering? 
 Now it's calm and you're battling a losing fight 
 I chose the mic to recite, ignite light in the night, aiiight 
 We should beat 'em President Clinton should delete 'em 
 It's not hard the CIA simply has no more job 
 Oh my Goddess mother you can fix this 
 We rock over mixes not 666's 
 Yo this is the message to all that can hear it 
 If you got secret information now's the time to share it 
 Call your Congress woman, your Senator, your Mayor 
 It's time for all the scholars to unite with all the playas 
 Rearrange and see times are definetely changing G. 
 They used to tap the phone now they're tapping while you're paging me 
 It's crazy B. yet it's plain to see who's the enemy who's left? 
 The NRA, the ATF, the AMA, ok, ok, it's all irrelevant 
 'Cause in the new millennium; there'll be no Central Intelligence."

 For things he hadn't done 
 Innocence on a ball and chain 
 Never feel the sun 
 Again honest face 
 Roses in his hands 
 But when he smiled at me 
 I could understand 
 If you're free you'll never see the walls 
 If you're head is clear you'll never freefall 
 If you're out right you never fear the wrong 
 If you're head is high you never fear at all 
 The daughter of the other man 
 Who took his life too young 
 She swore she'd never do those things 
 Then did just what he'd done 
 Adam boy has gone insane 
 Voices in his head 
 No one knows what they say 
 Now his mothers dead 
 If you're free you'll never see the walls 
 If you're head is clear you'll never freefall 
 If you're right you never fear the wrong 
 If you're head is high you never fear at all 
 Cuttin' me down 
 Cuttin' me down 
 There was a man who had a face 
 It looked alot like me 
 I saw him in the mirror and I fought him in the street 
 Then when he turned away I shot him in the head 
 Then I came to realize I had killed myself 
 If you're free you'll never see the walls 
 If you're head is clear you'll never freefall 
 If you're right you never fear the wrong 
 If you're head is high you never fear

 They tried to take it, and say that I'm too small 
 Cool, 'cause I don't get upset 
 I kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, then I jet 
 Back to the lab without a mic to grab 
 So then I add all the rhymes I had 
 One after the another one, then I make another one 
 To dis the opposite then ask if the brother's done 
 I get a craving like I fiend for nicotine 
 But I don't need a cigarette, know what I mean? 
 I'm raging, ripping up the stage and don't it sound amazing

 'Cause it's sort of an addiction, magnetized by the mixing

 'Cause I'm an E F F E C T 
 A smooth operator operating correctly 
 An E F F E C T 
 An E F F E C T 
 An E F F E C T 
 An E F F E C T 
 A smooth operator operating correctly 
 A smooth operator operating correctly

73,Rage Against The Machine,rock,Snoop Bounce,"Ain't no funk, it's funky, it's Doggystyle 
 (Death Row-ow, Death Row) 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Shucks, stomping in my big blue chucks 
 More bounce to the ounce while I'm ditching you klutz 
 Bump-bump-bump-bump while you're bumping your sounds 
 It's the zoo and the Pound we don't fuck around 
 Relax your mind and let your conscience be free 
 And get down, stomping grounds is the LBC 
 I slid up out the game and MC's get wacked 
 But now I'm back (Oh shit!), so go get your strap 
 Watch your head, I break bread 
 Wit G's, Muslims, hard-heads and dreds 
 Bounce, rock while rollerskating 
 On them 20 inch tires with the platinum Daytons 
 I'm not that BG popping all that junk 
 About ""I'll fuck you up"", he sound like a punk 
 I been there and done that, no inspiration 
 All day demonstration beat conversation 
 Snoop, come bounce to this 
 Snoop, come bounce to this 
 Snoop, come bounce to this 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 I keep niggas in the studio, word is bond 
 Been working on ya new album for two years strong 
 And still can't come up with the right song 
 You know what they say:'Study long, study wrong' 
 All aboard the train so come along 
 'Cause we keep the glue stuck against the bone 
 It's all right ain't no room for wrong 
 Doggyland is the motherland, make yourself at home 
 I got money loads by the barrels 
 I even got a few fans that's crazy like DeNiro 
 I'm international money maker, player hater 
 Shake up for the sake of spending dollars and I always holler 
 At a player though 'cause players know the real from the fake 
 You can put that on your toast, your coast and your state 
 I give you people what you like 
 What I look like in jail and can't get on the mic 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Killing up crews, give 'em the real street blues 
 Have 'em sliding in their eel-skins, grooving in their tennis shoes 
 Of course it don't stop being a Westside ridah 
 Wit no tattoos that's how they got you 
 I lay conversation on wax and CD's 
 BG's and originals, here come the mission 
 Making biters ride the Pound for the rest of the season 
 Doggy DPG ya lil homey 
 Look, I represent the LBC-meant 
 Windows tint, nigga that's the president 
 I hit you with a tune every blue moon 
 Collard on your plate so you can stuff it in your face 
 Nigga say your Grace before you touch your plate 
 It taste like it's laced but it ain't 
 This one puff uncut, no doubt 
 Everybody know I gotta ounce in the house 
 Snoop 
 Death row. 1-9-9-7. Snoop DOGG. Rage Against the Machine. 
 Rock and roll hip hop. 
 You thought I'd fall off. I'll fall off into this dope-ass rock and 
 Roll track. Y'know? 
 Charlie Wilson. Bow down. 
 This is crackin' y'all. This how we doin' it. 
 You know. 
 Bitch! 
 Bounce to this [Repeats]"
74,Rage Against The Machine,rock,The Last Emperor,"This voice shatters the calm of the day like an alarm, 
 So wake up bright anew and take up arms, 
 'Cause more is necessary than vocabulary war, 
 'Cause the toxic rock (crack) import's hitting on your door. 
 CIA, I'll see you later 'cause your time is coming soon. 
 I flip this shit like Pacino and it's your dog day afternoon. 
 Attica, Attica, drug agents you bring your static-a. 
 My alphabet will slash and then can flip you automatic-a, 
 Dramatic like Ali-Shaheed Mohammed* brought the vibes. 
 I bring the sun at red dawn upon the thoughts of Franz Fanon. 
 So stand at attention devil ???, 
 You'll never survive choosing sides against the Wretched of the Earth (Fanon's book). 
 The infiltrator, 
 ??? Intoxicator, 
 People incarcerator, 
 Liberation movement annihilator. 
 We got you clocked pushing rocks and it fell. 
 We got brothers trooping subways like the Ho Chi Minh trail. 
 We got the truth addict, Last Emperor, KRS and history manifested. 
 Tomorrow tha next lesson. 
 You claim I'm selling' crack but you be doing' that. 
 You know the cops, they got a network for the toxic rock. 
 You claim I'm selling' crack but you be doing' that. 
 So get that flashlight outta my face. 
 You claim I'm selling' crack but you be doing' that. 
 The Last Emperor, KRS-One and Big Zack. 
 As free-market capitalism and technology expands, 
 The third world's fertile soil becomes a desert wasteland. 
 So it takes ??? to demand the government provide answers, 
 When Lady Liberty has me bewitched like Samantha, 
 And poverty is one of the most malignant forms of cancer. 
 To all my black magik romancers and acid rain dancers, 
 Develop close ties like Jerry Seinfeld and George Costanza. 
 We fear no man and throw jams that attack counter-intelligence programs. 
 Exciting like the epic adventures of Conan, 
 I colonize minds like Zaire by the Belgians. 
 Now what hell is the problem with this system and what it sells us? 
 I bring ancient relics like Wyclef did to zealots. 
 I saw an iron curtain called hip-hop and got it open like Boris Yeltsen. 
 Whirlwind tornadoes in the rain forest if you say so. 
 KRS and the Last Emperor war like the Green Hornet and Kato. 
 Zack de la Rocha brings the enraged flow. 
 But all three drop science and become the most powerful alliance since NATO. 
 Need I say the CIA be criminals in action, 
 Cocaine crack-unpacking, high surveillance-tracking. 
 Prominent blacks and whites giving orders for mass slaughters. 
 I want all my daughters to be like Maxine Waters. 
 When they flooded the streets with crack cocaine I was like Noah, 
 Now they ???? 'cause the whole Cold War is over. 
 Communism fell to the dollars you were grabbing. 
 All the assault and battering in the name of intelligence-gathering 
 Now it's karma you're battling--a losing fight. 
 I choose the mic to recite, ignite light in the night, aight. 
 We should beat em, President Clinton should delete 'em. 
 It's not hard, the CIA simply has no more job. 
 Oh my goddess, mother, you can fix this. 
 We rock over mixes, not 666s. 
 Yo, this is the message to all that can hear it. 
 If you got secret information now's the time to share it. 
 Call your congresswoman, your senator, your Mayor. 
 It's time for all the scholars to unite with all the playas. 
 Rearrange and see, times is definitely changing, G. 
 They used to tap the phone now they tapping while you paging me 
 It's crazy B. yet it's plain to see who's the enemy. Who's left? 
 The NRA, the ATF, the AMA? OK, OK, it's all irrelevant 
 'Cause in the new millennium there'll be no central intelligence."
