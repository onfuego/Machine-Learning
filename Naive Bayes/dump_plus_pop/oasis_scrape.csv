 Try to put a word in for me 
 It's been so long since I found a space 
 You'd better put in two or three

 Our heads are firmly fixed in the ground 
 What we don't see, well it can't be real 
 What we don't touch we cannot feel 
 Where we're living in this town 
 The sun is coming up and it's going down 
 But it's all just the same at the end of the day 
 And we cheat and we lie 
 Nobody says it's wrong, so we don't ask why 
 'Cause it's all just the same at the end of the day 
 We're throwing it all away 
 We're throwing it all away 
 We're throwing it all away at the end of the day 
 If you're needing something I can give 
 I know I'd help you if I can 
 If you're honest and you say that you did 
 You know that I would give you my hand 
 Or a sad song in a lonely place 
 I'll try to put a word in for you 
 Need a shoulder? Well if that's the case 
 You know there's nothing I wouldn't do 
 Where we're living in this town 
 The sun is coming up and it's going down 
 But it's all just the same at the end of the day 
 When we cheat and we lie 
 Nobody says it's wrong, so we don't ask why 
 'Cause it's all just the same at the end of the day 
 Don't throw it all away 
 Don't throw it all away 
 Don't throw it all away

 Sometimes is just seems so simple 
 I'm feeling like I'm down on my knees 
 Sometimes like a man in the middle 
 I don't know my own mind 
 Won't you let me be 
 'Cause I can find you 
 Living in my world 
 Dragging me round 
 Just like a dog on a lead 
 But when I find my 
 Own peace of mind I 
 I will believe

 It's cold inside 
 But it's lonely in your bed 
 In your bed 
 And though we might be 
 But what you heard before 
 Is sleeping in your brain 
 But if you came with me 
 The days'd never end 
 Would never be the same 
 They'd never be the same 
 They'd just go by a different name 
 They'd never be the same"

 It's hard enough sitting there 
 Rocking in your rocking chair 
 It's all too much for me to take 
 When you're not there 
 It's hard enough being alone

39,Oasis,rock,Step Out,"What she said 
 She said to me 
 Take me high on a mountain side 
 She was dressed up in leopard skin 
 And her soul would never be denied 
 I met her down the disco in a beat up car 
 She was burning down the road 
 She looked just like a star in a Jaguar 
 She needs to lighten her load 
 And when you might 
 Think you're gonna cry 
 It will be alright 
 Step out tonight 
 You might 
 Think you're gonna cry 
 It will be alright 
 Step out tonight 
 What I said I said to her 
 I'm alive when you walk that way 
 Can you hear what I can hear? 
 It's the sound of a brand new day 
 She met me down a disco in a beat up car 
 I was burning down the road 
 I can be a star in my Jaguar 
 I need to lighten my load 
 Because you might think you're gonna cry 
 It will be alright 
 Step out tonight 
 You might 
 Think you're gonna cry 
 It will be alright 
 Step out tonight 
 My whole life's still sinking in the water 
 Yea you're my bitch c'mon rescue me tonight 
 You might

 It will be alright 
 Step out tonight 
 You might 
 Think you're gonna cry 
 It will be alright

 Is a storyteller sleeping alone 
 He has no face and he has no name

 It belongs to a friend of a friend 
 And as we drink to ourselves 
 We'll amuse ourselves 
 Underneath the sky 
 Underneath the sky again 
 Underneath the sky again 
 So wish me away to an unknown place 
 Am I living in a land with no name? 
 I'll be making a start with my brand new heart 
 Stop me making sense once again 
 All we need is our lives in a suitcase 
 They belong to a friend of a friend 
 And as we drink to ourselves 
 We'll amuse ourselves

 There's gonna be a loser 
 And you know the next goal wins 
 Cab it to the front as it's called a draw 
 Everybody's knockin' at yours once more

 Say it loud and sing it proud today

 It's up to us to make 
 The best of all the things that come our way 
 'Cause everything that's been has past 
 The answer's in the looking glass 
 There's four and twenty million doors 
 On life's endless corridor 
 Say it loud and sing it proud and they 
 Will dance if they wanna dance

 It will not fall 
 Not from the sky 
 And it don't eat no humble pie 
 And you may have your quiet life

 He lives a sleazy lie 
 But he's all alone again 
 Again 
 I can see a liar 
 Sitting by the fire 
 Trouble in his heart 
 Laughing at the thought 
 Coming as he goes into overdose 
 I wonder what he thinks of me 
 Baby, the time is right 
 To tell it all like it is 
 And now that I feel Godlike 
 There's nothing that can't be kissed 
 He sits upon a throne 
 He lives a sleazy lie 
 But he's all alone again 
 Again 
 I can see a liar 
 Sitting by the fire 
 Trouble in his heart 
 He's laughing at the thought 
 Coming as he goes into overdose 
 I wonder what he thinks of me 
 Baby, you're a liar 
 Sitting by the fire 
 Trouble in your heart 
 You're laughing at the thought 
 Yeah baby, you're a liar 
 Sitting by the fire 
 Trouble in your heart 
 You're laughing at the thought 
 Coming as you go into overdose 
 I wonder what you think of me"
74,Oasis,rock,Roll It Over,"I can give a hundred million reasons 
 To build a barricade 
 I blame it on the changing of the seasons 
 The thoughts that I've conveyed 
 Does it make it all right? 
 It doesn't make it all right 
 To roll it over my soul 
 And leave me here 
 Roll it over my soul 
 And leave me here 
 Look around at all the plastic people 
 Who live without a care 
 Try to sit with me around my table 
 But never bring a chair 
 Does it make it all right? 
 It doesn't make it all right 
 To roll it over my soul 
 And leave me here 
 Roll it over my soul 
 And leave me here 
 To roll it over my soul 
 And leave me here 
 Roll it over my soul 
 And leave me here 
 To roll it over my soul 
 And leave me here 
 Roll it over my soul

 They put it in a headlock and 
 They sealed my fate 
 Somewhere inside the world 
 In which they live 
 Because I failed 
 They constantly ignore me and 
 They told me I lost my mind but 
 I believe that I rule the world 
 I'm singing out my revolution song 
 Like nothing else matters 
 And you can pitch your gold against my soul 
 But I bet you get shattered 
 And there's a million houses in my heart 
 It won't be long 
 It won't be long 
 Till I solve my mystery 
 It would for me 
 What do I believe in and 
 A masterkey 
 Is somewhere inside of the world in which I live 
 And what for they 
 They will speak for no-one 
 And I may have lost my mind 
 But I believe that I rule my world 
 I'm singing out my revolution song 
 Like nothing else matters 
 You can pitch your gold against my soul 
 But I bet you get shattered 
 And there's a million houses in my heart 
 It won't be long 
 It won't be long 
 Till I solve my mystery 
 And I'm singing out my revolution song 
 Like nothing else matters 
 And you can pitch your gold against my soul 
 But you gotta get shattered 
 And there's a million houses in my heart 
 And it won't be long 
 It won't be long 
 Till I solve my mystery

76,Oasis,rock,(As Long As They've Got) Cigarettes In Hell,"Spend your days just walking and shopping 
 Depending on how much your luck is in 
 Spend the night-life table-hopping 
 And trying to keep that bag of bones in trim 
 I don't mind not feeling immortal 
 'Cause it ain't all that as far as I can tell 
 I don't mind not going to heaven 
 As long as they've got cigarettes 
 As long as they've got cigarettes in hell 
 By the time we start getting used to 
 The dope that's forming on the windowsill 
 Now we know we've got ourselves into 
 The cage that keeps the mice on the treadmill 
 I don't mind not feeling immortal 
 'Cause it ain't all that as far as I can tell 
 And I don't mind not going to heaven 
 As long as they've got cigarettes 
 As long as they've got cigarettes in hell 
 I don't mind not feeling immortal 
 Because it ain't all that as far as I can tell 
 And I don't mind not going to heaven 
 As long as they've got cigarettes 
 As long as they've got cigarettes in hell"

 I'm getting tired 
 I'm sick of all my records and the clothes I bought today 
 Am I cracking up 
 Or just getting older? 
 Staying in 
 I can't be bothered 
 Making conversation with the friends that I don't know 
 Am I cracking up 
 Or just getting older? 
 And I bet that this is how life 
 Turns out when you're finally grown 
 And you know if this my life 
 Sit around all day and I moan 
 I'm halfway up to the bottom 
 Of another bottle 
 Of my next best favourite friend 
 Am I cracking up 
 Or just getting older? 
 You're not cracking up 
 You're just getting older 
 We're not cracking up 
 We're just getting older"

 So the heavens would cry over me? 
 Who stole the soul from the sun 
 In a world come undone at the seams? 
 Let there be love 
 Let there be love 
 I hope the weather is calm 
 As you sail up your heavenly stream 
 Suspended clear in the sky 
 Are the words that we sing in our dreams 
 Let there be love 
 Let there be love 
 Let there be love 
 Let there be love 
 Come on, baby blue 
 Shake up your tired eyes, the world is waiting for you 
 May all your dreaming fill the empty sky 
 But if it makes you happy, keep on clapping 
 Just remember I'll be by your side 
 And if you don't let go, it's gonna pass you by 
 Who kicked a hole in the sky 
 So the heavens would cry over me? 
 Who stole the soul from the sun 
 In a world come undone at the seams? 
 Let there be love 
 Let there be love 
 Let there be love 
 Let there be love 
 Let there be love 
 Let there be love 
 Let there be love 
 Let there be love

 Flew me to a place not far away 
 She's a little pilot in my mind

 Give her all the love she gives to me 
 Talk of better days that have yet to come 
 I never felt this love from anyone 
 She's not anyone 
 She's not anyone 
 She's not anyone 
 A man can never dream these kind of things 
 Especially when she came and spread her wings 
 Whispered in my ear the things I'd like 
 Then she flew away into the night 
 Gonna write a song so she can see 
 Give her all the love she gives to me 
 Talk of better days that have yet to come 
 Never felt this love from anyone

 It's all they can do to be part of a queue in this town 
 I fall down, heaven won't help me 
 I call out, no one will hear 
 There'll be no tomorrow they say, well I say more's the pity 
 Stand tall, stand proud 
 Every beginning has broken it's promise 
 I'm having trouble just finding my soul in this town

 My head's in the clouds but at least I'm trying 
 I'm out of control but I'm tied up tight 
 Come in, come out tonight 
 There's a hole in the ground into which I'm falling 
 So God speed to the sound of the pounding 
 I'm all into the blinding light 
 Come in, come out, come in, come out tonight 
 Love is a time machine 
 Up on the silver screen 
 It's all in my mind 
 Love is a litany 
 A magical mystery 
 And all in good time 
 And all in good time 
 And all in good time 
 It's all in my mind 
 Love is a time machine 
 Up on the silver screen 
 And all in good time 
 And all in good time 
 And all in good time"
123,Oasis,rock,I'm Outta Time,"Here's a song 
 It reminds me of when we were young 
 Looking back at all the things we've done 
 You've gotta keep on keeping on 
 Out to sea 
 It's the only place I honestly 
 Can get myself some peace of mind 
 You know it's getting hard to fly 
 If I'm to fall 
 Would you be there to applaud 
 Or would you hide behind them all? 
 'Cause if I had to go 
 In my heart you'd grow 
 And that's where you belong 
 If I'm to fall 
 Would you be there to applaud 
 Or would you hide behind them all? 
 'Cause if I had to go 
 In my heart you'd grow 
 And that's where you belong 
 If I'm to fall 
 Would you be there to applaud 
 Or would you hide behind them all? 
 'Cause if I had to go 
 In my heart you'd grow 
 And that's where you belong 
 Guess I'm outta time 
 I'm outta time 
 I'm outta time 
 I'm outta time 
 I'm outta time 
 ""As Churchill said, it's every Englishman's inalienable right to live where the hell he likes. 
 What's it going to do, it's gonna vanish? 
 Is it not going to be there when I get back?"""
124,Oasis,rock,(Get Off Your) High Horse Lady,"Get off your high horse, lady 
 I don't need a ride tonight 
 Get off your high horse, lady 
 I don't need a ride tonight 
 Lay down 
 I hear your soul song singing 
 From a fire in the sky 
 I hear your soul song singing 
 From a fire in the sky 
 Rain down 
 Rain down 
 Get off your high horse, lady 
 I don't need a ride tonight 
 Get off your high horse, lady 
 I don't need a ride tonight 
 Lay down 
 Lay down"
125,Oasis,rock,Falling Down,"The summer sun that blows my mind 
 Is falling down on all that I've ever known 
 In time we'll kiss the world goodbye 
 Falling down on all that I've ever known 
 Is all that I've ever known 
 A dying scream makes no sound 
 Calling out to all that I've ever known 
 Here am I, lost and found 
 Calling out to all 
 We live a dying dream 
 If you know what I mean 
 And all that I've ever known 
 It's all that I've ever known 
 Catch the wheel that breaks the butterfly 
 I cry the rain that fills the ocean wide 
 I tried to talk with God to no avail 
 I called him up in and out of nowhere 
 Said ""If you won't save me, please don't waste my time"" 
 (All that I've ever known) 
 (It's all that I've ever known) 
 Catch the wheel that breaks the butterfly 
 I cry the rain that fills the ocean wide 
 I tried to talk with God to no avail 
 I called him up in and out of nowhere 
 Said ""If you won't save me, please don't waste my time"" 
 The summer sun that blows my mind 
 Is falling down on all that I've ever known 
 In time we'll kiss the world goodbye 
 Falling down on all that I've ever known 
 Is all that I've ever known"
126,Oasis,rock,To Be Where There's Life,"Days turning to night 
 Pray for the light 
 Let me come through 
 Let me take you 
 Way over the line 
 Everyone falling 
 Everyone falling 
 Jailers come crawling 
 Neighbours jump walling 
 Let me come through 
 Let me take you 
 Way over the line 
 Over the line 
 Over the line 
 Over the line 
 And we'll wake 
 To be where there's life 
 Shake the will to comply 
 Fears don't try me 
 Tears don't cry me 
 And we'll wake 
 To be where there's life 
 When we come cold out 
 Everything is sold out 
 TV just closed down 
 There's nothing on the news now 
 Fears don't try me 
 Tears don't cry me 
 And we'll wake 
 To be where there's life 
 Be where there's life 
 Be where there's life 
 Be where there's life 
 Be where there's life 
 Dig out your soul 
 'Cause here we go 
 We gotta move 
 It's what we do 
 Let me come through 
 Let me take you 
 And we'll wake 
 To be where there's life 
 Be where there's life 
 Be where there's life 
 Let me take you over the line 
 Under the signs 
 In through locked doors 
 To secret floors 
 Where we've all stood before"
127,Oasis,rock,Ain't Got Nothin',"They got nothing on me anymore 
 They got nothing on you 
 I don't care what they say anymore 
 All I want is the truth 
 Out on bail 
 To unveil 
 Here's a song 
 Sing along 
 They got nothing from me anymore 
 I got nothing for you 
 I don't care what they say anymore 
 All I want is the truth 
 Out on bail 
 To unveil 
 Here's a song 
 Sing along 
 Watch my style 
 Pick up pace 
 Wipe that smile 
 From your face 
 Out on bail 
 To unveil 
 Here's a song 
 Sing along 
 Watch my style 
 Pick up pace 
 Wipe that smile 
 From your face 
 They got nothing on me anymore 
 They got nothing on you 
 I don't care what they say anymore 
 All I want is the truth"
128,Oasis,rock,The Nature Of Reality,"The nature of reality 
 Is pure subjective fantasy 
 Space and time and here and now 
 Are only in your mind 
 I've seen off God and devil too 
 With no weapon, just the truth 
 Belief does not existence make 
 It's only in your mind 
 The nature of reality 
 Is only in your mind"
129,Oasis,rock,Soldier On,"Hold the line 
 Friend of mine 
 Sing a song 
 Soldier on 
 Shine a light 
 For me tonight 
 Don't be long 
 Soldier on 
 Who's to say 
 That you were right 
 And I was wrong? 
 Soldier on 
 Come the day 
 Come the night 
 I'll be gone 
 Soldier on 
 Soldier on, soldier on, soldier on, soldier on 
 Soldier on, soldier on, soldier on, soldier on 
 Soldier on, soldier on, soldier on, soldier on 
 (Soldier on, soldier on, soldier on, soldier on) 
 (Soldier on, soldier on, soldier on, soldier on) 
 (Soldier on, soldier on, soldier on, soldier on) 
 (Soldier on, soldier on, soldier on, soldier on)"
130,Oasis,rock,Lord Don't Slow Me Down,"I'm tired and I'm sick. 
 Got a habit that I just can't kick. 
 I feel hungover and I'm all in love when the lights go down I'm gonna shoot 'em all. 
 S'alrite, don't be afraid. 
 You gotta keep dreaming in the bed you made and if it tastes like shit well it beats sleeping rough on the floor. 
 Keep saying that my head's locked up in the clouds. 
 Keep praying that the Lord won't slow me down. 
 I'm tired and I'm sick. 
 Got a habit that I can't, won't lick. 
 I feel hungover and I'm all in love let the lights go down me and you are gonna, shoot 'em all. 
 Keep saying that my head's locked up in the clouds. 
 Keep praying that the Lord won't slow me down. 
 I'm tired and I'm sick. 
 Got a habit that I just can't kick. 
 I feel hungover and I'm all in love when the lights go down me and you are gonna shoot 'em all."

132,Oasis,rock,I Believe In All,"I can take 'em all 
 So I leave you with this thought 
 There's a fire in the sky 
 I don't need no alibi 
 See I believe in all 
 And do you hear me when I say 
 That I gotta walk this way 
 There's a fire in the sky 
 I don't need no alibi 
 See I believe in all 
 And I will catch you when you fall 
 That's what I'm gonna do 
 And I will catch you if you call 
 That's what I'm gonna do 
 I can see for miles 
 And I can see you and your crimes 
 There's a fire in the sky 
 I don't need no alibi 
 See I believe in all 
 Do you hear me when I say 
 That I gotta walk this way 
 There's a fire in the sky 
 I don't need no alibi 
 See I believe in all 
 And I will catch you when you fall 
 That's what I'm gonna do 
 And I will catch you if you call 
 That's what I'm gonna do"
133,Oasis,rock,Those Swollen Hand Blues,"I can't see the wood for the trees 
 Life is like a roller coaster 
 I can't find the birds or the bees 
 Hope they're down the back of my sofa 
 Feeling like a rolling stone 
 Playing the guitar on my own 
 I'm the apple of my eye 
 If only I could keep myself sober I'd remind myself why 
 They stare at me wherever I go 
 Why won't everybody give up, no 
 I wish I learn to play piano 
 If only I could keep myself sober for more than one day"
