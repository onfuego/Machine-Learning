0,Frank Ocean,pop,Strawberry Swing,"When we were kids, we handpainted strawberries on a swing 
 Every moment was so precious, then 
 I'm still kicking it, I'm daydreaming on a strawberry swing 
 The entire Earth is fighting, all the world is at its end 
 Just in case, an atom bomb, comes falling on my lawn 
 I should say and you should hear I've loved 
 I've loved the good times here, I've loved our good times here 
 Say hello, then say farewell to the places you know 
 We are all mortals, aren't we? Any moment this could go 
 Cry, cry, cry, even though that won't change a thing 
 But you should know, you should hear, that I have loved 
 I have loved the good times here, and I will miss our good times here 
 Spaceships are lifting off of a dying world 
 And millions are left behind while the sky burns 
 There wasn't room for you and I, only you, goodbye, goodbye 
 Now the sky, could be blue, I don't mind 
 Without you it's a waste of time 
 Could be blue, I don't mind 
 Without you it's a waste of time 
 The sky could be blue, could be grey 
 Without you I'm just miles away 
 The sky could be blue, I don't mind 
 Without you it's a waste of time"

 Did didn't I can't feel nothin', superhuman 
 Even when I'm fuckin' Viagra poppin', every single record autotunin' 
 Zero emotion, muted emotion, pitch corrected, computed emotion 
 I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile 
 Stripper booty and a rack like wow, Brain like Berkeley 
 Met her at Coachella, I went to see Jigga, she went to see Z Trip, perfect 
 I took a seat on the ice cold lawn, she handed me a ice blue bong, whatever 
 She said she wanna be a dentist really badly, she's in school payin' 
 For tuition doin' porn in the Valley, at least you workin' 
 But girl I can't feel my face, what are we smokin' anyway 
 She said don't let the high go to waste, but can you taste a little taste of 
 Novocaine, baby, baby, Novocaine, baby, I want you 
 Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb 
 Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none 
 Love me none, love me none, numb, numb, numb, numb 
 Sink full of dishes pacin' in the kitchen, cocaine for breakfast, yikes 
 Bed full of women, flip on a tripod, little red light on shootin', I'm feelin' like 
 Stanley Kubrick, this is some visionary shit 
 Been tryna film pleasure with my eyes wide shut but it keeps on movin' 
 I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile 
 Stripper booty with the rack like wow, I'll never forget ya 
 You put me on a feelin' I never had, never had, never had 
 And ever since I've been tryna get it back, pick it up and put it back 
 Now I'm somethin' like the chemist on campus 
 But there's no drug around, quite like what I found in you 
 I still can't feel my face, what am I smokin' anyway 
 She said don't let the high go to waste but can you taste a little taste of 
 Novocaine, baby, baby, Novocaine, baby, I want you 
 Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb 
 Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none 
 Love me none, love me none, numb, numb, numb, numb 
 Novocaine for the pain 
 Pretty girls involved with me

2,Frank Ocean,pop,We All Try,"I believe Jehovah Jireh 
 I believe there's heaven, I believe in war 
 I believe a woman's temple 
 Gives her the right to choose but baby don't abort 
 I believe that marriage isn't 
 Between a man and woman but between love and love 
 And I believe you when you say that you've lost all faith 
 But you must believe in something, something, something 
 You gotta believe in something, something, something 
 I still believe in man 
 A wise one asked me why 
 'Cause I just don't believe we're wicked 
 I know that we sin but I do believe we try 
 We all try, the girls try, the boys try 
 Women try, men try, you and I try, try, we all try 
 I don't believe in time travel 
 I don't believe our nation's flag is on the moon 
 I don't believe our lives are simple 
 And I don't believe they're short, this is interlude 
 I don't believe my hands are cleanly 
 Can't believe that you would let me touch your heart 
 She didn't believe me when I said that I lost my faith 
 You must believe in something, something, something 
 You gotta believe in something, something, something 
 I still believe in man 
 A wise one asked me why 
 'Cause I just don't believe we're wicked 
 I know that we sin but I do believe we try

4,Frank Ocean,pop,Songs 4 Women,"When I was younger I used to wonder like 
 If I was singing songs, just to sing the songs 
 Or if was singing cause that's what the bitches wanted 
 I couldn't play guitar like Van Halen 
 Had no secret chords like Saint David 
 But you still came around, ate your lunch with me 
 Used to park your car to try to bus with me 
 But I would say girl don't be dumb, I'm riding shotgun 
 We could go to my house after school after school (after school) 
 Cause my dad don't clock off till late (off till late, off till late) 
 We could kick it in the living room looking through my whole vinyl collection 
 And you could teach me how to slow dance or something 
 And I'mma give you chills harmonizing to Otis, Isley, Marvin 
 And every time somebody asked me 
 If I sing songs to get at women, I say yeah 
 They say no fair no fair that's cheating 
 I say shit, oh well, oh well 
 And every time a nigga asks me 
 If I sing songs to get at women, I say yeah 
 They say no fair, no fair that's cheating 
 I say boy don't judge cause hell if you were me 
 You'd be singin' to her, like lah dah dah dah 
 Now I'm in the lab, always working late 
 Always sleeping past, the breakfast she makes 
 She used to stop by, come and holla at me 
 Put her purse down and try to battle rap me 
 She don't do that no more (no more, no more) 
 Don't even listen to the songs I record 
 But she be banging that Drake in my car 
 I'm so far gone, she stay blasting Trey and his songs 
 All damn day long, it's like she never heard of me (heard of me) 
 Now every time somebody asks me 
 If I sing songs to get at women 
 I say naw they say okay I don't believe it 
 I say nope I swear I never do it 
 And every time a nigga asks me 
 If I sing songs to get at women, I say naw 
 They say who do you think you're kidding 
 I know you, you stole my girlfriend 
 Now see I just don't play fair, but it's fair enough 
 Cause yo girl broke my heart in half 
 Now I'm singing 'bout heartbreak 
 And now I'm singing 'bout love lost"
5,Frank Ocean,pop,LoveCrimes,"Talk to me and I better not hear a word 
 Do me baby, I better not feel it girl 
 Baby, I still got one bullet left in my nine 
 Finna do a lovecrime, lovecrime, finna do a lovecrime 
 Murder, murder, murder she wrote 
 Lovecrimes, lovecrimes 
 You write me love letters with your father's pen 
 If he knew the freaky, freaky things that you write with it 
 Is it really wrong that I want to be the baby daddy? 
 Is that a lovecrime, lovecrime? Tell me it's a lovecrime 
 Murder, murder, murder she wrote 
 Lovecrimes, lovecrimes 
 In the getaway car 
 You know I love it when the ride is smooth 
 If we ever get caught 
 It'd be a long vacation for two 
 Murder, murder, murder she wrote

 Frank Ocean: 
 My grandaddy was a player, pretty boy in a pair of gators 
 See I met him later on, think it was 1991 
 The only dad I'd ever know, but pretty soon he'd be gone too 
 Hide my face, hide my face, can't let 'em see me crying 
 'Cause these boys didn't have no fathers neither 
 And they weren't crying, my friend said it wasn't so bad 
 You can't miss what you ain't had, well I can, I'm sad and 
 There will be tears, I've no doubt 
 There may be smiles but a few 
 And when those tears have run out 
 You will be numb and blue 
 I can't be there, that's all you had to say to me was 
 You couldn't be there, why couldn't you say to me 
 You won't be there, you coulda warned me 
 You wouldn't be here right here, you wouldn't be here for me, no, no, no, no

8,Frank Ocean,pop,Swim Good,"That's a pretty big trunk on my Lincoln town car, ain't it? 
 Big enough to take these broken hearts and put 'em in it 
 Now I'm driving 'round on the boulevard, trunk bleeding 
 And every time the cops pull me over, they don't ever see them 
 They never see them 
 And I've got this black suit on 
 Roaming around like I'm ready for a funeral 
 Five more miles till the road runs out 
 I'm about to drive to the ocean 
 I'mma try to swim from something bigger than me 
 Kick off my shoes and swim good and swim good 
 Take off this suit and swim good and swim good, good 
 Got some pretty good beats on this 808 CD, yeah 
 Memory seats I'm sitting on stay heated 
 I woulda put tints on my windows but what's the difference? 
 If I feel like a ghost (no Swayze) ever since I lost my baby 
 I have this black suit on 
 Roaming around like I'm ready for a funeral 
 One more mile till the road runs out 
 I'm about to drive in the ocean 
 I'mma try to swim from something bigger than me 
 Kick off my shoes and swim good, and swim good 
 Take off this suit and swim good, and swim good, good 
 I'm going off 
 Don't try stopping me 
 I'm going off 
 Don't try saving 
 No flares 
 No vest 
 And no fear 
 Waves are washing me 
 I'm about to drive to the ocean 
 I'mma try to swim from something bigger than me 
 Kick off my shoes and swim good and swim good 
 Take off this suit and swim good and swim good, good"
9,Frank Ocean,pop,Dust,"Who's that talking in the library? 
 Who's that talking in my library? 
 Is that you? No, I won't put you out 
 'Cause what would this place be without my muse? 
 Nothing special 
 Every book in here I wrote 
 Some I'm not too proud of, some I wish I could burn 
 So many pages I wrote, wish I could revise them 
 But there's no erasing and the best advice I got 
 Was keep writing, yeah, and keep living, yeah 
 And keep loving, oh, loving, loving, loving 
 And when the ink dries and the pages turn to dust 
 So will we turn to dust, so will we, dust, dust 
 Who's that laughing in my library? 
 Who's that laughing in my library? 
 Is that you? No, I won't put you out 
 'Cause what would this place be without your smile? 
 Nothing special 
 I fell in love with you, girl, oh 
 You let yourself inside with no respect for privacy 
 You said there's too much on my mind 
 Then you ripped out a page and set that shit on flame 
 I quit writing and oh, I kept living 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, I kept loving 
 And when the ink dries and them pages turn to dust 
 So will we turn to dust, so will we, dust, dust"
10,Frank Ocean,pop,American Wedding,"Ah 
 American love, American me 
 American you, American tear 
 American heartbreak 
 Oh oh oh 
 I took a walk with the palm trees, as the daylight fell 
 Sangria in the canteen, talkin' to myself 
 This tattoo on my left hand is turning purple-ish blue 
 Daydreams of the romance, daydreams of you 
 My pretty woman in a ball gown, I'm Richard Gere in a tux 
 Gettin' married in the courthouse, writing vows in a rush 
 Makin' out before the judge, with my teenage wife 
 Got a wedding band done, that I just might die with 
 It's an American wedding 
 They don't mean too much but we were so in love 
 We had an American wedding 
 Now what's mine is yours, that's American law 
 M-R-S dot Kennedy, she signed her name in pen 
 In a fancy fancy cursive, then turned her term papers in 
 A thesis on Islamic virgin brides and arranged marriage 
 Hijabs and polygamist husbands, those poor un-American girls 
 After school she ran to me, jumped in my 5.0 
 This is the home of the brave, land of the free 
 But your, parents still didn't know 
 She said, ""I've had a hell of a summer, so baby, don't take this hard 
 But maybe we should get an annulment before this goes way too far"" 
 It's just an American wedding 
 They don't mean too much, they don't last enough 
 We had an American wedding 
 Now what's mine is yours, American divorce 
 Well you can have my Mustang, that's all I've got in my name 
 But Jesus Christ don't break my heart, this wedding ring won't ever wipe off 
 But if you stay, oh if you stay (Stay) 
 You'll probably leave later anyway, it's love made in the USA 
 James Fauntleroy: 
 Don't let 'em front you to saying you can't move 
 Without 'em, fuck 'em I tell 'em this ain't new 
 We been some hustlers since it began dude 
 Ain't gon' be trippin' over some bitch ass dude 
 They so vain I tell 'em this ain't you 
 You can get sensitive but the shit ain't true 
 These niggas can't do nothin' that I can't do

 Man, I had a dream and then the shit came true 
 And nigga if I did it I think you can too 
 These niggas can't do nothin' that I can't do 
 That she can't do, that he can't do

 Over again over again, over again over again 
 Making love, underneath the cherry leaves 
 Baby girl, tell me how my nature feels 
 Said oh baby, up against the cherry tree 
 Baby girl, I'll give it to you naturally, naturally 
 Feeling like Adam when he first found out this existed 
 Me and my Eve trying out our first positions 
 And it's all good, and it's all free, and it's all you, and it's only me 
 Playing in the dirt wrestling myself inside you 
 Give it you over again, over again over again 
 Over again over again, over again over again

 So-lo that I can admit 
 When I hear that another kid is shot by the popo 
 It ain't an event no more 
 So-lo that no more high horses, so hard to wear Polo 
 When I do, I cut the pony off 
 Now there's a hole that once was a logo, how fitting 
 So-lo that I can give a fuck about what is trending 
 Tryna cut down on my spending 
 Regardless of winning, instead of pretending 
 And bending over backwards 
 Over half of these hoes had work done 
 Sayin' they want something real from a man 
 Just saying it, we being real persons 
 I hate that it's like this, I feel for you ant 
 I don't know what it's like with a skirt on 
 So pardon me if I am being insensitive 
 But darling this only worsens 
 So-lo my halo, stay way low, it feels like it's bent 
 So-lo that when they throw pussy or pesos 
 I don't pay no attention to it 
 So-lo that I am no rookie but feel like a kid 
 Lookin' at the other kids 
 With astonishment while I'm on punishment 
 Watchin' the summer come close to an end 
 After 20 years in, I'm so naive 
 I was under the impression 
 That everyone wrote they own verses 
 It's comin' back different and yeah that shit hurts me

 I was just telling that I got this girl before 
 And I was together since 3 years 
 And uh, I was not even cheating her or what 
 And Facebook arrived and uh she wanted me to accept her on Facebook 
 And I don't want it because I was like in front of her 
 And she told me like ""Accept me on Facebook"" 
 It was virtual, means no sense 
 So I say ""I'm in front of you, I don't need to accept you on Facebook"" 
 She started to be crazy 
 She thought that because I didn't accept her 
 She thought I was cheating 
 She told me like, uh, ""it's over"" 
 I can't believe you 
 I said ""come on you're crazy"" because like yeah 
 I'm in front of you, I'm every day 
 Here in your house 
 That's, it means like it's jealousy 
 Pure jealousy for nothing 
 You know 
 Virtual thing"

 But you could've held my hand through this, baby 
 In my mind, I didn't need 
 Warned your ex 
 I run my hands through what's left 
 But we're getting older, baby 
 How much longer baby? 
 Why am I preaching? 
 To this choir, to the saved kids

 I care for you still and I will forever

 We got so familiar 
 Spending each day of the year, White Ferrari 
 Good times 
 In this life, life 
 In this life, life 
 One too many years 
 So taste what I lived on a facelift 
 Mind over matter is magic 
 I do magic 
 If you think about it it's over in no time the best life 
 I'm sure we're taller in another dimension 
 You say we're smaller and not worth the mention 
 You're tired of movin', your body's achin' 
 We could vacay, there's places to go 
 Clearly this isn't all that there is 
 Can't take what's been given 
 But we're so okay here, we're doing fine

 You dream of walls that hold us in prison

 Rare as the feathers on my dash from a phoenix 
 There with my crooked teeth and companions sleeping, yeah

 That could think of dreaming and getting a glimmer of God 
 I be dreaming a dream in a thought 
 That could dream about a thought 
 That could think about dreaming a dream

50,Frank Ocean,pop,Greedy Love,"I hated every time we go out 
 Got everybody complimenting you 
 You love attention from the big crowd 
 Feels like I'm on the sidelines 
 Right next to suckah and I am the buster girl 
 Who's this other guy that sending you these flowers 
 Oh now you tell me your ex is your best friend. 
 Call me crazy 
 But all I want is you to myself 
 To share with NO ONE 
 You can call it jealous but I call it my greedy love. 
 Greedy loveee x2 
 Oh my greedy love 
 The smile on your face when you got that text late at night wasn't cause of me 
 Who else could it be? 
 And why when you're with your friends it's always movie night or girl's night 
 Feels like I'm ridin' the bench 
 Right next to suckah and I am the buster girl 
 On the dance floor you're showing off your best moves 
 You see my blown fuse cause everybody's on you 
 Call me crazy 
 But all I want is you to myself 
 To share with NO ONE 
 You can call it jealous but I call it my greedy love. 
 Greedy loveee x2 
 Oh my greedy love 
 Greedy loveee x2 
 Oh my greedy love 
 The only thing I wish is all that's in your heart 
 Tho it seems like I'm nagging oh 
 Is wanting only me too much to ask 
 When all I want is you to myself 
 To share with NO ONE 
 You can call it jealous but I call it my greedy love.

51,Frank Ocean,pop,Hardest Thing,"Look, maybe I should just be clear, 
 It sucks not having you here... 
 There ain't a better way to say it, 
 Other than how I just said it there... 
 Like a bottle of Avion you can see through me, 
 My ego ain't here... 
 So many clever words and nice things, 
 That I could say ... the truth then 
 And the truth now has been the same. 
 The hardest thing to say is what I ain't saying, 
 And the best way to say it, it is to just say it... 
 Wanna run away from the words, 
 But I can't run away from the world 
 Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying... 
 Girl I love you... still... 
 I try to go some months without a call, 
 I mean I'm an attractive guy and all... 
 Oh yeah, yeah, yeah... 
 Maybe I can find something in the club, 
 Or something in the mall... mall... mall... 
 But them girls didn't matter and 
 This money ain't distracting me much at all... 
 I know some clever words and nice things, 
 That I could say... but the truth then 
 And the truth now have been the same... oh 
 The hardest thing to say is what I ain't saying, 
 And the best way to say it, it is to just say it... 
 Wanna run away from the words, 
 But I can't run away from the world 
 Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying... 
 Girl I love you... 
 But girl I wanted to cry but I made it look easy... 
 To hold it in the same phase... 
 And it was harder to stay so I made it look easy... 
 To just get up and walk away... 
 Now I'm alone and the tears do fall, (they do fall) 
 Holding my mouth and the words do fall... 
 Now I'm standing here after all... 
 Broken heart, but I'm strong and hard... 
 The hardest thing to say is what I ain't saying, 
 And the best way to say it, it is to just say it... 
 Wanna run away from the words, 
 But I can't run away from the world 
 Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying... 
 Girl I love you... 
 Still..."

 Ain't seen rainbows in the sky since college

 Mother fuckers getting lynched and burned 
 I earned it, my flog gnaw badge is looking good 
 On this brand new jacket 
 The donuts on the flag waving over the cabin 
 Now grab them graham crackers and pass them over here 
 Hurry, quickly I need a piece of Hersheys 
 Darker than the corners of the bushes we be lurking 
 I centered the mellow over the graham 
 Heated it too long now it's melting over my hand 
 Fuck it, I'll bite it, I burnt it, but I liked it 
 Camping with my niggas, it's so fucking exciting 
 We're making smores by the campfire 
 Camp flog gnaw, golf wang summer 
 Sat by the fire, do witness gentle

 Run my fingers through 'em as you wax and buff my muffler 
 'Cause I fingered you, you think the fucking ring is coming up?

 Riding on my pegs, and my back against your legs
