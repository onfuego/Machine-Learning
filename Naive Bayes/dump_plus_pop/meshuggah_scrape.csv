 Who searched his way through car parts 
 Afraid to be recognized by a spoon 
 Birds with empty refrigerators heated up the

 There was no chance to drive the table without 
 A blue sock, 'cause my mistakes rolled down above

 Only to receive the certainty-there's no help to be found 
 No one's to blame as streams of equality washes away, 
 The last traces of humanity's existence.

 Took its toll in exterminations' enhance.

 We're both the same. 
 Plug me in, re-connect me to myself. 
 Plug me in, re-connect me to my soul. 
 Gone is all my hope, 
 All my vain illusions. 
 Deceived, I dwell in me, 
 In the core of my agony. 
 I fade in this duress, 
 I'm weakening. 
 The one who claimed my front is now the claimant of my soul. 
 Into the core of self, The neuro-axis, I fade. 
 Within the fading core of self, I am... 
 Gone-bound, lost, away, phased out, non-existing."
24,Meshuggah,metal,New Millennium Cyanide Christ,"I'm a carnal, organic anagram. human flesh instead of written letters. 
 I rearrange my pathetic tissue. I incise. I replace. I'm reformed. 
 I eradicate the fake pre-present me. Elevate me to a higher human form. 
 The characters I am, made into a word complete, then I'll be the new norm. 
 Self inflicted fractures; I replace my bones with bars. 
 Aluminum bleeding oxide; the drug of gods into my pounding veins. 
 My receiving eyes exchanged with fuses; blindness induced to prevent destruction. 
 Ceramic blades implanted past my ribs to save me from the dues of inhalation. 
 I tear my worldly useless skin. Staples to pin it over my ears. 
 Non-receptive of ungodly sounds - I disable the audio-generators of fear. 
 Hexagonal bolts to fill my mouth, sharpened to deplete the creator of all violence; 
 Without speech there will be no deceit 
 Baptized in vitriolic acid, a final touch, a smoothing of features. 
 Completion of the greatest art; to cast the godly creatures. 
 Humans, once astray; made divine, stripped of congenital flaws. 
 We're incandescent revelations in a world of darkened forms. 
 Disciples! Come join with me to save a failed humanity. 
 Follow the god of cyanide into the new eternity. 
 Behold! A sacrificial race a cleansing worshipping of pain. 
 The new millennium Christ here to redeem all from lies."

 We're the carriers of a new anomaly; 
 Fold, 
 Unfold. 
 Bend, 
 Shift color. 
 Always turning our backs to the wind. 
 Deaf to the inner voices screaming. 
 Purpose, profit, act only to gain. 
 Blistered tongues from licking greedward. 
 Taste the enemy. 
 Throw up their means. 
 Swallow the bits that fit your needs. 
 Keep your eyes searching in all directions, 
 Scanning for opportunities off you go. 
 Begin your climb. 
 Aim for the topmost twig of lies. 
 Put on a shape to pass undisturbed. 
 Pick a color to blend with surroundings. 
 Choose a voice suiting, 
 Appropriate for the never benignant purpose. 
 Spin your eyes to read the court. 
 Smoothen your path before the start 
 Even out, 
 Fill the holes with the toxic clay of your rotting heart. 
 A contagious neuro-ego-disease. 
 A virus sticking to liars. 
 We're the self-centered fuel to boost the new strain of fire. 
 Adapting, shifting, lacking opinion. 
 Our numbers exceeding the billions. 
 Everly walking among ourselves down the corridor of chameleons. 
 Continue through the skein of boughs, 
 Navigate to keep you straight on track. 
 Make the right ramification-turns. 
 Conceit will be your allied guide. 
 Climb the hierarchy ladders invisibly, 
 Veiled by the canvas of putrid dreams. 
 Every obstacle surmountable to the clouded vision you've conceived. 
 Scan the wall of truth for cracks. 
 Your prey: the secrets hiding therein. 
 Feed upon its nourishing intestines to bring you forth in the ""game"" 
 With every single step taken on the road of games called success, 
 There's a fee for every lie. 
 The currency: your dissolving integrity. 
 Will you make it to the top of the tree? 
 Is the fortune there to be found? 
 Chameleons are a short-lived breed. 
 Maybe fate will find you dead on the ground.

 Incorporate this forfeit cause, 
 Assimilate and fake it mine.

 All all to claim my reward. 
 Master and servant. 
 One for all and all for none. 
 Ignorant to the distant hymns of chaos,

 Default to conform to the new. 
 They animate me. 
 In confidence I thrive. 
 My reign: supremacy. 
 I speak no word unheard. 
 Remotivate me. 
 I'm all there is to be. 
 An omnipotent being complete in my diversity 
 Ripples race across my eyes. 
 Breaking out in acid sweat. 
 Wills shrivel and crack. 
 Disintegration of my inner self. 
 I find the substance lost. 
 A shed shell of a being of disgust. 
 Done is the cleansing. 
 Complete is the surgery of the soul. 
 Step inside and taste the shackling thoughts that devour all confidence. 
 Realizing I'm lost. 
 Being no more than a mutt with a fake pedigree. 
 Stillborn soul shaped and molded. 
 I can live an eternity in a minute's time. 
 A borrowed talent filled with copied goals. 
 The carcass of hope lies dead beneath the fabric of dreams. 
 Facing the truth within the mirror of souls 
 -Ha ha!- This is what I've become. 
 Always been in this emancipated state. 
 Submerged, battered and numb. 
 Just a mindscape fit for illusion to make fear into reign and fulfillment of pain. 
 Kneeling in perm 
 The minions of the inside claim me 
 Reanimate, me 'cause I was once alive. 
 Defeat smears out my focus. 
 Consciousness subsides 
 Unmotivated.

 Infinity stares back at me.

 I'm the sin,

 Infatuated by contentment. 
 I laugh at lies. 
 Come behold the sickness in my common human eyes. 
 I'm the greed. 
 The cynic. 
 I'm the indifferent gaze.

 Empty, strained, unmoving eyes; Introverted, paralyzed 
 A burning mass of emotions denied, enraged by years of silencing. 
 An accumulation of feelings suppressed, returning to devour. 
 Bright rays of chaos, generated by subconsciousness. 
 A retribution by own thoughts; twisting the mind into fits 
 Fuelled with pains unveiled. Burning with contamination. 
 Set afire by disowned self-lies; they penetrate the eyes. 
 I... Am I the next? Self inflicted overload. 
 Thoughts returning to think me away. 
 I... Will I be reprieved, 
 Or am I just awaiting the sentence of my exquisite, 
 Internal machinery of torture 
 The turmoil arises, from the innermost core of denial. 
 Shining streams of putrefaction, reflugent with disease - 
 In outward motion to redress the balance by retaliation. 
 A terminal journey to relieve cognition of Ability 
 Minds lit like candles, by rejected senses and emotions. 
 Tearing flames, born in mind; Creations of self deception. 
 Strained, not to lose the grip - Humans locked in the new disease. 
 A light by eyes unseen has come to burn us clean. 
 (Chorus:) I... Am I the next?... 
 I sense; The facilities of the bodily; Discorporated by the light 
 All my pleas; denied 
 By my psychological enemy 
 The inner light unseen 
 I... I'm deceived by my 
 Receiving eyes; - susceptible 
 To the endless killing-sights 
 Consciousness fails the grip. Substance now decreasing 
 Amorphous. Without shape - I'm vanishing; dematerialized 
 My own corrosive thoughts - Probes armed with acid tools 
 Disintegrated, I'm bleached out of reality 
 Scattered bits internally; My last transparent remains; 
 Floating objects inanimate; Spinning into my soul 
 Defeated by my contents. Tables turned, I'm a thought repressed 
 I'm swallowed into myself. Destination; nothingness 
 I... Am I the next? Self inflicted overload 
 Thoughts returning to think me away 
 I... Will I be reprieved 
 Or am I just awaiting the sentence of my exquisite, 
 Internal machinery of torture 
 I... I've been the next. My self inflicted overload, 
 My neglected thoughts have thought me undone.

 Decomposing bits of organic matter, brought to life, revived. 
 A fluid, limbless, sickening shape, a faltering semi-floating cluster. 
 Its sole purpose of creation; To burst the imagination blood surge. 
 Defying the mould of human flesh. Smashing the wall of beliefs. 
 A sight to bring insanity to all dimensional reality. 
 Carved from thoughts unthought into a graphic, visible delusion of life. 
 A twisted display of dehumanized features, by cells reflected, refracted. 
 A frantic dancing of particles, in pathetic attempt at rendering flesh; 
 Swirling to project the illusion of shape, form, dimension and mass. 
 (Eyes not made for watching. Thousand watt obsidian bulbs; 
 Reflective, obversed. The only view is the barren self) 
 A walking translucent entity. Void, suspended. Inviolate by rules, all standards of existence. 
 An electrified vapor-cloud. A skein of bone and tissue. 
 An atrocity, a liquid form unshaped to the organic norm. 
 A mind not filled with thoughts, but a random flickering static. 
 A soulless creature un-alive; I'm the un-human elastic."

 Still, in machine-like strife you gain another mile 
 The temporary elusive goal: 
 To reach the solace, to feed once more upon the synthetic reaper of loss. 
 No matter the outcome, the cost 
 Cold and stinging needs tearing through the halls 
 Of your defiled, flesh made temple with its closing walls 
 Still you claim the worshipers pose and you bow. You kneel 
 Control: once superior, now a docile pet at chaos's feet 
 Pulling the leash as it trails the scent to where all hurt recedes 
 Your past a blurry patch in mind, your future once; now thin dreams filed 
 Toward the lights of need you strive - to drink into your vein the shine 
 Beaten to the unforgiving ground. 
 Lashed into submission by the inner starving demon, by its unrelenting hand 
 Still you claim the worshipers pose and you bow. 
 You kneel to the syringe 
 Answering only to authorities of sedation. 
 Their calls the only ones heeded 
 A worn out soldier touched by their contagion. 
 A battered drone at their feet 
 You're the one betrayed. 
 An outcast set afire by your inner war 
 Your burning self so far astray. 
 A combustion fanned from within your core"

 A systematic denial of the crystalline 
 To see the fine grain, to read the hidden words 
 The context of parallel truth 
 Devoid of fragmentation 
 Our light-induced image of truth 
 Filtered blank of its substance 
 As our eyes won't adhere to intuitive lines 
 Everything examined, separated, one thing at a time 
 The harder we stare 
 The more complete the disintegration 
 Dissolution 
 Eyes re-opened 
 Reasoning focalized 
 Receptors activated 
 Perspectives distorted 
 The ladder beyond our grasp 
 The twin-headed serpent forever hidden

 Where engines of the sane and insanity merge

 The unity 
 Reality untouchable, transparent 
 Invisible to our fixed, restricted fields of vision 
 Existence taken for granted

 Possessed, owned, controlled 
 By the common sense-infected rational gaze 
 Onward forever we walk among the ignorant 
 Never stray from the common lines"

 Twisted in its accusing glare 
 Teeth glimmering in emotional rage 
 Spit of hate suspended in mid-air

 Now replayed in succession of millions 
 The one second I will always regret

 Held within the visualization, 
 The continuous rerun of my own violence

 Corrosion soothing the hurt within 
 Surroundings reaching to touch your skin 
 Progress in stalemate. Death is alive 
 Eyes and mind glint - Glints collide 
 Pains sending shivers of wellbeing down your spine. Sounds of healing crack your bones 
 Lamentation carving into smiling faces. Surrounded by everyone, still you're all alone 
 Wormholes set as halos over sinners' skulls. Leaves chasing the fallen air away 
 A lifetime of needle-eyes too wide to escape, where honesty lies and angels betray 
 Incisions mending the wounds within

 Limits of pain by far exceeded

 Bloodletting - the stringent voice to beckon my soul 
 So futile, any resisting tension 
 As death-induced mechanics propel its growth 
 The implement, the device of my extinction 
 The terminating clockwork of my gleeful bane 
 The definitive scourge of its mockery 
 The end-art instruments lethality attained 
 Heed - it commands, heed my will 
 Bleed - it says, bleed you will 
 Falling into the clarity of undoing 
 Scornful gods haggle for my soul 
 Mind's eye flickers and vascillates as I let go 
 Taunting whispers accompany my deletion 
 A sneering grin, the voice of my reaper 
 Chanting softly the song of depletion"
56,Meshuggah,metal,Lethargica,"The void clenches its determined jaws 
 A lethargic, careless motion to kill 
 Monstrous, prodigous, indifferent 
 Slow and deliberate its torturous skills 
 Its molars grind and shatter 
 Onerous, leaden bringers of hurt 
 Unhurried in its deadly intent 
 The undoer of all, dense and inert 
 Its design perfected through aeons 
 Pure, immaculate, clean, omnicidal god/machine 
 Calm, precise ambition 
 Untroubled by the roar of unending screams 
 The droning blare of absolute doom 
 The downpitched moan of collapsing dreams 
 Composed, cold, unconditional 
 Uncompromising 'til all is death 
 Extinction, ruin, its malicious cause 
 'Til the last exhalation of human breath"
57,Meshuggah,metal,ObZen,"A state of perfection, immersed in filth 
 Equilibrium obtained 
 Pure in devotion to all things unwell 
 This sweet Zen of our ill condition sustained 
 A new belief-system 
 Salvation found in vomit and blood 
 Where depravation, lies 
 Corruption, war and pain is God 
 Balance 
 Harmony found in the sickly, the vile 
 Unflinching eyes, joyous and gleaming 
 Intense in their need to watch things die 
 A new belief-system 
 Salvation found in vomit and blood 
 Where depravation, lies 
 Corruption, war and pain is God 
 Decay, disgrace, disgust 
 Our state of Zen 
 The grime of contempt and degeneration 
 Sticky, foul and pungent 
 The sediment of our creation 
 We flourish in this bloodred soil"
58,Meshuggah,metal,This Spiteful Snake,"Reality, this spiteful snake 
 Rearing its ugly head 
 Venom dripping from its grin 
 As it tosses yet another obstacle in our way 
 If given a thousand years to collect 
 To process, to portray 
 We could never encompass the voracity 
 Of one single day 
 Trapping us in its winding 
 Its closing malignant cycles 
 A tightening coil to bind us 
 Hold us tight in unforgiving embrace 
 It's all-engulfing jaws, infinite, boundless 
 Biting down on the dying flesh of hope 
 Its fiery breath leveling, dismantling 
 Flattening, tearing down the structures of our dreams 
 Overcome, defeated 
 Terrified, shivering, mute 
 Reality is terror, this truth is absolute 
 Reality, this spiteful snake 
 Shedding its smothering veil 
 A shroud to asphyxiate 
 Exterminate, eradicate"
59,Meshuggah,metal,Pineal Gland Optics,"How come I shiver, hurt and bleed, 
 If in dreams I cannot truly feel 
 Who would dare say, who would claim 
 This hallucination isn't real 
 Synaptical glitch looking glass 
 So enticing, real and free of lies 
 Prodigious, omnifarious 
 It nourishes, it feeds my starving eyes 
 Artificial the catalyst, organic its progeny 
 Voracious spectral offspring - so sweet in its hunger 
 Unbound this new vision, optical regenesis 
 Threatening, so complete in beautiful deformity 
 These authoritative visions order my collective senses, 
 My questioning, doubtful, rigid self to kneel 
 A Judas syndrome in effect - former self the deceiver 
 Its denial the wretched kiss that kept this in disguise 
 Cast off - the conceiling veil, the rational cloak of doubt 
 Torn off - the restraints, the blinded's shackles 
 Burned away - the agony, the fear, true grief 
 A new set of eyes cleansed by a new belief"
60,Meshuggah,metal,Pravus,"Drooling floods of lead 
 Armed with distorted belief 
 Sharp munition spat from our minds 
 Malignancy-rounds, automatic fire 
 Black, acidic bile 
 Seeping wounds of shattered souls 
 Still not pissing out fast enough 
 To quench our thirst for it to bleed us dry 
 Vile, ever-menacing intent 
 Repulsive belligerence shot from toxic minds 
 Blatant disregard for all but self 
 Proudly flaunting the depravity of a race condemned, malign 
 Iterate, repeat these my words 
 Recite the mantra of late: 
 I will corrupt and impair 
 Vitiate, dispirit, debase, violate 
 Souls born with hateful intent 
 The deceitful spawn, descendants of lies 
 By the poisoned nails of history stung 
 If granted the will to injure 
 If granted the will to harm 
 - The blades of hurt inexhaustibly swung"
61,Meshuggah,metal,Dancers To A Discordant System,"Listen to the hidden tune 
 The essence of lies in notes defined 
 As we dance to the dissonant sway 
 The choreography refined 
 Will subdued and shackled 
 Reason washed aside 
 Pledging our love to the chains 
 Our ignorance ever-amplified 
 Bloodened hands lead the waltz 
 We're trapped in the out of tune swirl 
 Still we set the show on continue mode 
 And dance to a discordant system 
 We accept the nails we're fed 
 Lies sharpened to bleed us silent 
 Muted from the pains 
 Defiance employed in vain 
 Any attempts to leave the dance, 
 Invisibly suppressed 
 Questions unasked, we learn the steps 
 Eyes shut like all the rest 
 Unsuspecting, willing, blind, controllable herd 
 Pawns in a covert game conducted by hands we trust 
 Dominated, compliant and deceptable 
 Confident that we matter - we don't see that we're but dust 
 Committed to a lie we cannot see, cannot know nor comprehend 
 We're all asinine drones kept in the dark, kept in line 
 Confined, bereft of reason 
 Withering in toxicity 
 The deadly fumes of deceit 
 And we all reek of complicity 
 Humbled, brought to our knees 
 By the weight of our own guilt 
 Our nescient ways the catalyst 
 To injustice and inhumanity 
 We dance - to appease 
 Compete in stupidity 
 Obscured faces file our points 
 Numbers fed to the machine 
 Still we stand in line for the next show 
 The human spine liquefied 
 What are we, but stupefied 
 Dancers to a discordant system 
 We believe - so we're misled 
 We assume - so we're played 
 We confide - so we're deceived 
 We trust - so we're betrayed"
62,Meshuggah,metal,I Am Colossus,"I'm the great Leviathan. Insatiable colossus 
 Titanic engulfer of lives. I reward you, absorb you 
 I'm the monstrous mouth that hungers for your awe 
 Immense construction of lies. I own you, disown you 
 I am life. I'm death. You empower me 
 I'm a mammoth king evoked, conjured by your dreams 
 Summoned by your fears. You need me, you feed me 
 I'm the imposing giant. Infallible dictator 
 My rules apply to all. You'll heed me, bleed for me 
 I am life. I'm death. I decide your fate 
 You empower me. You'd even kill for me 
 Guzzling down your dreams - the tears of unheard pleas I drink, 
 Imbibe with such delight the fear that floods your temporal shell 
 Raging red rivers and streams - the kingdom of my shadow 
 Where dread of man in endless night revives my every cell 
 To those who doubt - your wounds will never heal 
 To those who question my creation - I'm not real 
 I am pain. I am grief. I'm the things you fear 
 I'm the lie whispered into your ear 
 I'm the great Leviathan. I'm dominance and greed 
 You imagined me, so I was conceived 
 I am life. I'm death. You belong to me 
 Call me what I am. I am colossus."
63,Meshuggah,metal,The Demon's Name Is Surveillance,"Mechanical compound eye 
 Imposed observance. Sentries in the sky 
 Vigilant lenses. Objectives belied 
 In blackened heavens covertly they hide 
 They see you. They see all. They know all indiscretions 
 Compiler of your dreams, your indignations 
 Following your every single move 
 They see you 
 All-seeing instrument. Supreme perception 
 Omnifocal accumulator 
 Thief of integrity. Its gaze upon the blind 
 Information divinity by man designed 
 The lives of all they occupy. Their eyes in dismal gloom 
 The all-piercing, dead oculi - mirrors of our doom 
 Oblivious to the trespass as you gaze into the black 
 The demon of surveillance insultingly staring back 
 - Into you 
 They own your every secret, your life is in their files 
 The grains of your every waking second sifted through and scrutinized 
 They know your every right. They know your every wrong 
 Each put in their due compartment - sins where sins belong 
 They know you. They see all. They know all indiscretions 
 Compiler of your dreams, your indignations 
 Following your every single move 
 They know you."
64,Meshuggah,metal,Do Not Look Down,"Strive, strive. Surmount the obstacles 
 Become the essence of your goals. Hereditary dream 
 Pray that you may attain that destiny. Fall into the coveted line 
 Where life is but a theme of pretense in lustrous guise 
 Claims and values. Charts of means and status 
 Plaques to show your strife. Do your neighbour clones approve 
 Picture perfect illustration - imitation of life 
 Where the path is evened out. All obstructions removed 
 Great viable citizen 
 Are you happy now? Then praise your God and bow 
 Shimmering surface. The gleam of blinding lies 
 Become the product, the thing you so desire 
 To what length would you go to reach your goals 
 What mantra will you use to justify your means 
 Who will you betray to secure your dream 
 What sins will you commit to avoid your sins be seen 
 Do not look down. Do not look down 
 Or the abysmal beast of nonconformity 
 Might stare some unpleasant truth 
 Into your desensitized mind 
 Shimmering surface. The gleam of blinding lies 
 Become the product, the thing you so desire"
65,Meshuggah,metal,Behind The Sun,"Carelessly you sentence. How indifferently you kill 
 The prophecies of man's corruption fulfilled 
 Arbitrarily you harm. Snap your fingers, cue demise 
 Murder on impulse. Your evil inclinations wrapped in lies 
 Divine man. Appointed. Claiming the stern voice of God 
 Absolute judgments passed from where you cowards hide 
 - The lair of snakes. Your dark haven 
 Where you and your ophidian partisans abide 
 The doctrine of your unholy trinity 
 - The violence, the spite and the enslavement 
 You awesome monarch, you man of dominance 
 All shall be as you decide 
 Illustrious ruler of all things 
 Wield your razors, cut the flesh of man 
 Control, govern and lead us 
 Into the nightmare of your wishes fulfilled 
 Grab the reins, you awesome puppeteer, you conductor of chains 
 Redeemer. Unbreakable strings. Damnation leashes 
 Remote cords extend, the trusses they run 
 They stretch all the way behind the sun 
 So vain our attempts, the useless tugging 
 This meaningless gnawing at restraints by which we're bound 
 Hail the tyrant saint, the great bereaver 
 You will bow before the emperor crowned"
66,Meshuggah,metal,The Hurt That Finds You First,"End this debate. No need to dream of solace 
 I'll be your truth in this game that is life 
 Your will withering away 
 Among the comatose but insight's not your fate 
 Minds align to fire the sequence 
 You will feel the knife as it turns 
 Taste visions of ruin and thirst 
 Make for save haven but I will find you first 
 Capitulate, you know this fight is over 
 Spiritual flesh, my stomach starts to churn 
 A perfected mindjack. Confirmed illusion 
 Euphoric state. You gag, you choke 
 Words, virus. They echo in your ears 
 True bliss through bondage and oh here come the tears 
 I find my joy in fear 
 A soul cadaver I'm the hurt that finds you first 
 Capitulate 
 Hide. You'll be mine either way 
 Grind my teachings on the soulless 
 In a sense, devastations structure bleeding through my sermon 
 The repose of true angels paves my way to power 
 Parasite a state of which you'll be proud 
 Under my soothing shroud 
 Innocence? 
 This systems roaring howl 
 Deafens all reason 
 Questions reduced to silence"
67,Meshuggah,metal,Marrow,"Lasciviously they move 
 Two powers bound for unity 
 Like magnets they align, under immunity 
 The product of their congress, their libidinous deed 
 - Insatiable mouth of conflict and greed 
 Beware the soon to be born bringer of pain 
 One evil by another inseminated 
 Pure hatred conceived 
 The pairing of blood and power 
 A spawn of harm produced 
 Death and profit begotten, fused 
 A ghost-producing offspring. Immorality's embodiment 
 Spite and disgust incarnate. A progeny insane 
 Tar-black ejaculate 
 The seminal bile of conspiracy 
 - The blood of those who died 
 Their innocence, their marrow 
 The pursuit of ruin. Murderous ambition 
 Bloodshed, the careless taking of lives 
 A conduct symbolic of its condition 
 Behold the newborn monstrosity 
 Descendant of avarice 
 Indifferent war machine in all its violent glory 
 A callous iron God born to reign 
 Tar-black ejaculate 
 The seminal bile of conspiracy

 Their innocence, their marrow"
68,Meshuggah,metal,Break Those Bones Whose Sinews Gave It Motion,"Tremors, reverberating frequency of doom 
 How strongly the violent thoughts of vengeance echo 
 Setting in motion the strings of hate. Shudder, shudder, vibrate 
 This is the soundtrack to our hostility, to our malicious intent, 
 To the pointless grudge forever held 
 The callow dream, the dismal wish to harm 
 Animate now the twisted sounds of our disdain, our rage 
 The notations to our contempt, to unforgiveness and loathing 
 A sonic declaration of spite and resentment 
 Its resonance grinding to dust our souls 
 The twine of revenge tightly strung 
 Its subharmonics the undoing of all 
 So enticing the retaliation-chords of man 
 The all-deafening oscillation of the damned 
 Let forth the hateful, the murderous 
 Let their malignant prayers resound 
 The reverbant, odious request. The wish of death abound 
 So enticing the retaliation-chords of man 
 The all-deafening oscillation of the damned"
69,Meshuggah,metal,Swarm,"Insectine man, carnivore. The shape of us, the conduct of flies 
 All-consuming swarm in inconspicuous disguise 
 Bloodseeking, parasitic. Ecstatically tracing decay 
 Thriving in the glow that death emits, the warm perfume it radiates 
 Revolting conformity. Hive mind unity 
 Excitedly their mandibles grind, aroused by vile ambition 
 At the sickly sweet promise of decomposition 
 Deliriously ingesting. Liquefied ruin absorbed 
 Innocence devoured by the elated horde 
 They are us, let's not even pretend 
 Aroused and frenzied they scurry, encircling death 
 A vile swarm awaiting the final breath 
 Myriad eyes visualizing the end 
 Blackened skies. Rabid heavens descend 
 On the bereft, unforgivingly 
 Precious life debased. Our dipteran legacy embraced 
 Crack the shell. Ascend the sky 
 Rise, extend your palpitating wings 
 Crack the shell. Ascend the sky 
 Fly you disgraceful wretched things"
70,Meshuggah,metal,Demiurge,"Writhing and embraced 
 Retribution. Soul eclipse turns solid 
 Energized. Sucking vomit acting like it's honey 
 Deprived of I 
 Falling while thrusting squares through circles 
 Serving one single new dimension 
 Terror rising. Agnostics nemesis. A prophet of extinction 
 I scorch the skies before your very eyes 
 My deliverance - enslavement labelled: love 
 Just trust this nemesis to sign and seal extinction"
71,Meshuggah,metal,Clockworks,"Dismantling the clockwork that makes me the cynic 
 Pallet, wheel and click 
 The properties of my indifference 
 Reverse-engineering what makes it tick 
 Dissecting the finetuned mechanism 
 Rack and barrel, spring and pin 
 Its synchronous characteristics 
 To kill what makes it spin 
 Disassemble this machinery 
 Re-program these eyes, undo this design 
 Labelled and filed, each part indexed 
 Broken to pieces then thoroughly burned 
 Deconstruction of what I am 
 Buried to make sure he never returns 
 Taken apart, defused, blueprints turned to ashes 
 Eradicate the last remains, remnants of the insane 
 Disintegration, the destruction of me now imperative 
 To purge myself of this condition, complete this dissolution a necessity 
 Break this deceitful machine 
 A lie, what once I was, obsolete instrument 
 An outmoded contraption, a malfunctioning device 
 That callous self now extinguished, that malignant self now disused 
 That conceited invention to nothing now reduced 
 Complete disintegration, the destruction of me now imperative 
 To purge myself of this condition, complete this dissolution a necessity 
 Break this deceitful machine"
72,Meshuggah,metal,Born In Dissonance,"We are origin, we are increate 
 You will see our coming for a thousand years 
 Every violent element incarnate made flesh and fused to one 
 You may call us remnant, as we are all that will be left 
 Brought forth by ancient whisper 
 Deployed by inverse suns 
 To capture the essence of creation and render it undone 
 We come to make all things collide 
 Those joules define what we are 
 An energy born in dissonance 
 Long before first ever star 
 Baptized in the river you call time 
 We know that we are sacred 
 In human tongue we're apocalypse 
 For we bring with us obliteration 
 Through spectacles tuned to infinity, 
 You will see our coming for a thousand years 
 You will know us then for what we truly are 
 The realization of every fear"

 Irradiant and treacherous 
 Neon prophecies hail the end, the capital of piety 
 Totalitarianopolis, city of dread

 This is where self is relinquished 
 Autonomy sacrificed 
 The idolatry of tyrants compulsory 
 Welcome all to MonstroCity where norm is that of the insane 
 All is illusion in MonstroCity 
 Bow to it, it knows your name 
 Relishing the idea of damnation 
 ""The wailing and gnashing of teeth"" 
 They know for sure where judgment's due 
 ""What's above and what's beneath"" 
 This is where we fail, where the self-righteous reign 
 The empire of imaginary ghosts 
 This is blind credulity's domain 
 MonstroCity 
 In here everyone knows ""the truth"" 
 Which unforgiving icon is real 
 Intolerance and prejudice saturates their zeal 
 This is where self is relinquished 
 Autonomy sacrificed 
 The idolatry of tyrants compulsory"
74,Meshuggah,metal,By The Ton,"To you a beast you think you comprehend 
 Not necessarily made all evil 
 In the reflective pool of your eyes 
 I see fear and intrigue co-mingle 
 You hesitate to deem me all bad 
 Yet when my face is shown, your eyes avert 
 New thoughts sprout from that fearfilled soil 
 Your nerves and intuition back on full alert 
 You think that you've seen the truth, you think you know 
 Yet disbelief grinds, the doubt it claws 
 In you sleepless delirium I devour your thoughts 
 If you only knew how your way of life sustains me 
 Like electricity coursing through my soul 
 Your will to retaliate, your vengeful thoughts announced 
 I bring you me - conflict and death 
 And the promise of spilling red by the ton 
 I just might be there in your final moment 
 I just might be the last thing your eyes take in"
75,Meshuggah,metal,Violent Sleep Of Reason,"A systematically applied veil to heedless eyes 
 Focus deflected, ignore 
 This is not our war 
 Bury the abject shame in the same bile as our ideals 
 The potent lubricant to deceits grinding wheels 
 The menacing implications, the violent sleep of reason 
 Betrayal we all help sustain 
 Humanitarian treason 
 This deadly inclination, this forfeiture of innocence 
 The sacrifice of guiltless souls for our own deliverance 
 The pain you feel 
 Indifference thrust into your back 
 Forged from our ignorance from our immorality 
 A parody, this mockery 
 To no avail you kneel before this our insanity 
 Another life condemned 
 Your fate sealed the second you came to exist 
 Your suffering non-essential for we care not if you subsist 
 We will all belie ang allusion, any crime 
 Cower and hide any culpability denied 
 All will imply it's an illusion, a fallacy 
 So when you die, remember we said it's not reality"
76,Meshuggah,metal,Ivory Tower,"Why mourn this travesty 
 Hide this slow degradation 
 Claw and compete mindlessly 
 All things undone too late 
 Craving our waking sleep 
 Is binding us to this ivory tower 
 Serves to complete the truth that we cling onto 
 So what are these things you hold true 
 The defensive wounds of the unknowing eye 
 Weeping thousands of wretched tears 
 To lubricate the end with our fear 
 The concussion from the crack of the whip 
 Nullifies, sensations die 
 Always numbing, always preaching 
 Never resting, never sleeping 
 The construction is our penance here 
 Tumorous growth chiseled in white 
 When the darkness comes to slay the day 
 Enters horrors that you'll be wishing away 
 Which is the way?"
77,Meshuggah,metal,Stifled,"Impotent king beneath our feet 
 You can rule down where you belong 
 In dirt compacted, buried deep, you dwell with those you wronged 
 Down there you can whisper, yell, even blare your odious lies 
 To your silent audience of worms as they share with you, your eyes 
 Tyrant, oppressor 
 Your once resounding voice now just muted cries 
 You self-avowed murderous god 
 Ranks of annelids now you delegate 
 Your commands unheard under ground 
 Where your voice will never resonate 
 Your time has come 
 Declare the majesty fallen 
 Your dominance, your hateful influence forever stifled 
 Your sleep no longer impermanent 
 Decaying matter now sums you up 
 Like all the lives you've taken 
 Now so are you retreating to dust"

 Halo-crowned invention 
 Sacred universal lie 
 Artificial, divine 
 Great archaic obseletum 
 A prevarication, deceitfully contrived 
 Synthesized, fictitious 
 Dreamed up by remote prototypes 
 Opiate for the yearning mass 
 Administered, applied 
 Three letter word for monster 
 Empty promises of healing 
 Profit aptly buried in the lies 
 An industry rapt with avarice 
 Medicatiing blind it's acolytes 
 Useless panacea 
 Imaginary cure-all 
 To you we cry and supplicate 
 Into your hell we fall 
 Blind belief in their eyes 
 Forever atoning 
 Credulousy waiting

 Death in your wake, those fantasies enacted 
 You will learn that our rage won't die 
 You will surely pay the ultimate price 
 There is no way you will escape our retribution 
 It will not matter how long it takes 
 You took them from us so we will take you 
 Do you believe that luck will somehow stand you by? 
 Do you really think our resolve will wane? 
 Do you really think that it will dissipate? 
 We will haunt you, we will come for you 
 To collect on what you owe to us 
 Eye for eye, life for life 
 Only payment in full can end this strife"
80,Meshuggah,metal,Into Decay,"The most eloquent confession, your silence 
 The most admitting trait, your turning away 
 Avert your eyes and hush your struggling thoughts 
 Detachment assumed as life mutates into decay 
 The most manifest sign, your disregard 
 The one apparent fault, your shunning of care 
 Contempt now bred, refed and will sustained 
 Division now groomed, nurtured and will maintained 
 Apathy, opprobrium 
 Virulence and animosity 
 This sums you up 
 Betrayal, disunion and fear, isolation 
 Caught in this endless spiral, locked equilibrium 
 A stasis founded in this atrophy of thought 
 Your eyes unflinching, unaffected by the misery 
 Gone is commiseration, gone is any sympathy 
 One last farewell to perspicacity 
 Final surrender to futility 
 Dissociation, severance 
 What have you done? 
 What have you become?"
