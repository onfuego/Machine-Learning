 You'd never guess what, you'd never believe this. All right listen to this. 
 Oh... what is it, Geri? 
 Ooh... what is it? Listen, listen listen. What is it? What is it?

 ""Bah! Humbug"" - no, that's too strong 
 'Cause it's my favorite holiday 
 But all this year's been a busy blur 
 Don't think I have the energy 
 To add to my already mad rush 
 Just because it is the season 
 The perfect gift for me would be 
 Completions and connections left from 
 Last year, world tour, aeroplanes and babies, 
 Met some guys but never the time 
 Most of '98 passed along those lines 
 So deck the halls and trim those trees 
 Raise up the cups of Christmas cheer 
 I just need to catch my breath 
 Christmas with my mates this year 
 Calendar picture, frozen landscape 
 Chilled this room for twenty-four days 
 Evergreens, sparkling snow 
 Get this winter over with! 
 Flashback to springtime, saw him again 
 Would've been good to go for a lunch 
 Couldn't agree we were both free 
 We tried, we said we'd keep in touch 
 We didn't, of course, 'til the summertime 
 Out to the beach to his boat, could I join him? 
 No, this time it was me 
 Sunburn in the third degree 
 Now the calendar's just one page 
 And, of course, I am excited 
 Tonight's the night, but I've set my mind 
 Not to do too much about it 
 All: 
 Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
 But I think I'll miss this one this year 
 Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
 But I think I'll miss this one this year 
 Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
 But I think I'll miss this one this year

 Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
 But I think I'll miss this one this year

 Hardly dashing through the snow 
 'Cause I bundled up too tight 
 Last minute have-to-do's 
 A few cards, a few calls 
 Because it's R-S-V-P 
 No thanks, no party lights 
 It's Christmas Eve, gonna relax 
 Turned down all of my invites 
 Last fall I had a night to myself 
 Same guy called, Halloween party 
 Waited all night for him to show 
 This time his car wouldn't go 
 Forget it, it's cold, it's getting late 
 Trudge on home to celebrate 
 In a quiet way, unwind 
 Doing Christmas right this time 
 All: 
 Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
 But I think I'll miss this one this year 
 Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
 But I think I'll miss this one this year 
 Emma: 
 Tesco has provided me 
 With the world's smallest turkey 
 Already in the oven, nice and hot 
 Oh damn, guess what I forgot? 
 So it's on with the boots, back out in the snow 
 To the only all-night garage 
 But when to my wondering eyes should appear 
 In the line that guy I've been chasing all year 
 ""Spending this one alone,"" he said 
 ""Need a break; this year's been crazy."" 
 I said, ""Me too, but why are you? 
 You mean you forgot the papers too?"" 
 Then suddenly we laughed and laughed 
 Caught on to what was happening 
 Christmas magic's brought this tale 
 To a very happy ending 
 All: 
 Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
 But I think I'll miss this one this year 
 Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
 But I think I'll miss this one this year

 The conscious liberation of the female state 
 Mothers, daughters and their daughters too 
 Woman to woman 
 We're singin' with you 
 The ""inferior sex"" has got a new exterior 
 We got doctors, lawyers, politicians too 
 Everybody take a look around 
 Can you see, can you see, can you see 
 There's a woman right next to you 
 Sisters are doin' it for themselves 
 Standin' on their own two feet 
 And ringin' on their own bells 
 Sisters are doin' it for themselves 
 Oh we ain't makin' stories 
 No, we ain't makin' plans 
 Don't ya know that a man still loves a woman 
 And a woman still loves a man 
 Now there was a time (there was a time) 
 When we used to say (when we used to say) 
 That behind every great man 
 There has to be a great woman 
 Well in these times of change 
 You know that it is no longer true 
 So we're comin' out of the kitchen 
 'Cause there's somethin' we forgot to say to you 
 And that's 
 Sisters are doin' it for themselves 
 Standin' on their own two feet 
 And ringin' on their own bells 
 Sisters are doin' it for themselves 
 Sisters are doin' it for themselves 
 (Doin' it, doin' it, do-doin' it, doin' it) 
 Sisters are doin' it for themselves 
 (All of my sisters, all of my sisters) 
 Sisters are doin' it for themselves"

51,Spice Girls,pop,Greatest Love Of All,"(The song that Melanie B sang to audition for the Spice Girls. Originally performed by Whitney Houston.) 
 I believe that children are our future 
 Teach them well and let them lead the way 
 Show them all the beauty they possess inside 
 Give them a sense of pride to make it easier 
 Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be 
 Everybody searching for a hero 
 People need someone to look up to 
 I never found anyone to fulfill my needs 
 A lonely place to be 
 So I learned to depend on me 
 I decided long ago 
 Never to walk in anyone's shadows 
 If I fail, if I succeed 
 At least I will live as I believe 
 No matter what they take from me 
 They can't take away my dignity 
 Because the greatest love of all 
 Is happening to me 
 I found the greatest love of all 
 Inside of me 
 The greatest love of all 
 Is easy to achieve 
 Learning to love yourself 
 It is the greatest love of all 
 I believe the children are our future 
 Teach them well and let them lead the way 
 Show them all the beauty they possess inside 
 Give them a sense of pride to make it easier 
 Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be 
 And I decided long ago 
 Never to walk in anyone's shadows 
 If I fail, if I succeed 
 At least I will live as I believe 
 No matter what they take from me 
 They can't take away my dignity 
 Because the greatest love of all 
 Is happening to me 
 I found the greatest love of all 
 Inside of me 
 The greatest love of all 
 Is easy to achieve 
 Learning to love yourself 
 It is the greatest love of all 
 And if by chance, that special place 
 That you've been dreaming of 
 Leads you to a lonely place 
 Find your strength in love"

 I have no choice, I hear your voice 
 Feels like flying 
 I close my eyes, oh God I think I'm falling 
 Out of the sky, I close my eyes

 You're here with me, it's like a dream 
 Let the choir sing 
 When you call my name it's like a little prayer 
 I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there 
 In the midnight hour I can feel your power 
 Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there 
 Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone 
 I hear you call my name 
 And it feels like home 
 Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there 
 Just like a muse to me 
 You are a mystery 
 Just like a dream, you are not what you seem 
 Just like prayer 
 No choice 
 Your voice can take me there

55,Spice Girls,pop,Can't Stay Tonight,"Woke up again today before I got to sleep 
 And the time has come for me, to say what's on my mind 
 Something is telling me, I wandered in too deep 
 And the roses came to late to save the vine 
 Whatever happens to us 
 Is gonna happen to us 
 Baby the feelings gone 
 We can't go on 
 Can't stay tonight 
 We're in trouble deep 
 Can't stay no more 
 Grass has grown around my feet 
 And I don't think, I can love you anymore 
 Can't stay tonight 
 You were the world to me, the sun that warmed the sky 
 But where the roses grow, they cannot stay and die 
 Look to your heart and see the truth you can't deny 
 There's nothing left to say, no need to cry 
 Whatever happened to us 
 Was gonna happen to us 
 Baby the feelings gone 
 We can't go on 
 Can't stay tonight 
 We're in trouble deep 
 Can't stay no more 
 Grass has grown around my feet 
 And I don't think, I can love you anymore

 Do you, do you think about me? 
 I see the setting sun, of another passing day 
 There's been questions on my mind, since you been away 
 Friend's say that you're doing well, you finally got it made 
 Outside I share my joy for you, but inside my heart still aches 
 It's like a melody, playing endlessly 
 You're always on my mind 
 And I wonder all the time 
 Do you think about me like I think about you? 
 Do you sometimes stay awake at night? 
 Till the morning light? 'cause you don't know what to do 
 Do you think about me like I think about you? 
 And do you toss and turn does your heart still burn? 
 For the passion we once knew 
 Do you think about me? 
 Do you, do you think about me? 
 Do you, do you think about me? 
 I see your face at night, in every dream I dream 
 Could this be a message, please tell me what it means 
 If I had your number, I'd call you on the phone 
 But your voice wouldn't be enough, it might be better left alone 
 It's like I press rewind, it's like the hands of time 
 They start all over again 
 Maybe this time, it won't end 
 Do you think about me like I think about you? 
 Do you sometimes stay awake at night? 
 Till the morning light? 'cause you don't know what to do 
 Do you think about me like I think about you? 
 And do you toss and turn does your heart still burn? 
 For the passion we once knew 
 Ooh... 
 I wanna know, oh, do you think about me? 
 Is there a chance that we could work it all out? 
 It's been so long obsession and it's so plain to see 
 That I got what you want, and I've sure got what you need 
 Do you think about me like I think about you? 
 (Like I think about baby, all through the night) 
 Do you think about me like I think about you? 
 (Do you, do you think about me, oh, oh now baby, eh hey, eh hey) 
 Do you think about me like I think about you?

71,Spice Girls,pop,My Strongest Suit,"Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere 
 Now I believe in looking 
 Like my time on earth is cooking 
 Whether polka dotted, striped or even checked 
 With some glamour guaranteeing 
 Every fibre of my being 
 Is displayed to quite remarkable effect 
 From your cradle via trousseau 
 To your death bed you're on view, so 
 Never compromise, accept no substitute 
 I would rather wear a barrel 
 Than conservative apparel 
 Because dress has always been my strongest suit 
 Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere 
 Staying in or hitting townwards 
 From the top and working downwards 
 I ensure that every stitch is stitched in time 
 Whether wig or hat or turban 
 Whether clad boudoir or urban 
 Not to strut your stuff outrageously's a crime 
 And the few who are invited 
 To my wardrobe are delighted 
 As they wander through my things to find en route 
 That in negligee or formal 
 I am anything but normal 
 Because dress has always been my strongest suit 
 Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere 
 Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere 
 Now you don't need a recital 
 Of the reasons why it's vital 
 That tonight my trappings will not be subdued 
 That from coronet to sandal 
 No one else is worth a candle 
 That I couldn't make more impact in the nude 
 So bring me all my finest 
 Most audacious, mi divine-ist 
 Most revealing, most expensive and taboo 
 Most arresting, most heart-stopping 
 Most free flowing, most eye popping 
 Because dress has always been my strongest suit 
 Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere"

 Well I wish it could be Christmas everyday 
 When the kids start singin' and the band begins to play 
 Oh I wish it could be Christmas everyday 
 Let the bells ring out for Christmas 
 When we're skating in the park 
 If the storm cloud paints it dark 
 Then your rosy cheeks are gonna light my merry way 
 Now the frosticals appeared 
 And they've frozen up my beard 
 And so we'll lie by the fire 
 Till the sleep simply melts them all away 
 Well I wish it could be Christmas everyday 
 When the kids start singin' and the band begins to play 
 Oh I wish it could be Christmas everyday 
 Let the bells ring out for Christmas

 Slam your body down and wind it all around. 
 If you wanna be my lover, you gotta get with my friends, 
 Make it last forever friendship never ends, 
 If you wanna be my lover, you have got to give, 
 Taking is too easy, but that's the way it is. 
 If you wanna be my lover, you gotta, you gotta, you 
 Gotta, 
 You gotta, you gotta, slam, slam, slam, slam 
 Slam your body down and wind it all around. 
 Slam your body down and wind it all around. 
 Slam your body down and wind it all around. 
 Slam your body down zigazig ah 
 If you wanna be my lover."

 Lyrics by tim rice 
 In life one has to face a huge assortment 
 Of nauseating fads and good advice 
 There's health and fitness, diet and deportment 
 And other pointless forms of sacrifice 
 Conversation, wit, I am a doubter 
 Manners, charm, they're no way to impress 
 So forget the inner me, observe the outer 
 I am what I wear and how I dress 
 Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere 
 Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere 
 Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere, ooh 
 Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere 
 Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere 
 Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere, ooh 
 Now I believe in looking like my time on earth is cooking 
 Whether polka-dotted stripes or even checks 
 With some glamour guaranteeing every fiber of my being 
 Is displayed to quite remarkable effects 
 From your cradle via trousseau to your death bed you're on view so 
 Never compromise accept no substitute 
 I would rather wear a barrel than conservative apparel 
 A dress has always been my strongest suit 
 Staying in or hitting townwards, from the top and working downwards 
 I ensure that every stitch is stitched in time 
 Whether wig or hat or turban, whether clad boudoir or urban 
 Not to strut your stuff outrageously's a crime 
 And the few who are invited to my wardrobe are delighted 
 As they wander through my things to find en route 
 That in negligee or formal I am anything but normal 
 A dress has always been my strongest suit 
 Now you don't need a recital of the reasons why it's vital 
 That tonight I simply have to look my best 
 That from coronet to sandal no one else is worth a candle 
 That I couldn't make more impact if I'm dressed 
 So bring me out my finest, most audacious, my divinest 
 Most revealing, most expensive and to boot 
 Most arresting, most heart-stopping, most free-flowing, most eye-popping 
 A dress has always been my strongest suit"

 If you don't be my dinner then you won't be my mate 
 If you wanna be my dinner, you have got to eat 
 Eating is too easy but that's the way it is! 
 What do you think about food now you know how I eat, 
 Say you can handle my food, are you for real 
 If you are tasty, I'll give you a try 
 If you're really yucky then I'll say good-bye! 
 Yo, I'll tell ya wot I want wot I really really want,

 We got chips and plaice, who like it in your face

 Ice-cream doesn't come for free, it's a real treeeeeat!

 If you wanna be my dinner dinner dinner"
