 They had a meeting in Mayfair 
 They got you down and wanna keep you there 
 It makes them worried, their bank accounts 
 That's all that matters and you don't count 
 Can't make no progress 
 Can't get ahead 
 Can't stop the regress 
 Don't wanna be dead 
 Look out, those rules and regulations 
 Who needs the Parliament? 
 Sitting making laws all day 
 They're all fat and old 
 Queuing for the House of Lords

 When hate and war come around

 I cheat if I can't win 
 If someone locks me out 
 I kick my way back in 
 And if I get aggression 
 I give 'em two time back 
 Every day it's just the same 
 With hate an' war on my back

 And we can watch you make it on the 9:00 news 
 Standing there in Palestine, lighting a fuse 
 Whatever you want, you're gonna get it 
 Tommy gun 
 Tommy gun, you'll be dead when your war is won 
 Tommy gun, but did you have to gun down everyone? 
 I can see it's kill or be killed 
 A nation of destiny has got to be fulfilled 
 Whatever you want, you're gonna get it 
 Tommy gun, you can be a hero in an age of none 
 Tommy gun, I'm cutting out your picture from page one 
 I'm gonna get a jacket just like yours 
 And give my full support to your cause 
 Whatever you want, you're gonna get it 
 So let's agree about the price 
 And make it one jet airliner for ten prisoners 
 Boats and tanks and planes, it's your game 
 Kings and queens and generals learn your name 
 I see all the innocents 
 The human sacrifice 
 And if death comes so cheap 
 Then the same goes for life"

 Cause Julie's been working for the Drug Squad 
 Cause Julie's been working for the Drug Squad 
 Ten years for you 
 Nineteen for you 
 And you can get out in twenty-five 
 That is if you're still alive 
 And then there came the night of the greatest ever raid 
 They arrested every drug that had ever been made 
 They took eighty-two laws through eighty-two doors 
 And they didn't halt the pull till the cells were all full 
 'Cause Julie's been working for the Drug Squad

 In every street and every station 
 Kids fight like different nations 
 And it's brawn against brain and knife against chain 
 But it's all young blood flowing down the drain

 And when some punk come looking for sound 
 Rastafari goes to ground 
 The white heart flipped his pocket dipped 
 Cause a black sharp knife never slips 
 And they never say to one another 
 That tomorrow we might kill a brother 
 The Crops hit the Stiffs 
 And the Spikes whipped the Quiffs 
 They're all looking 'round 
 The Crops hit the Stiffs 
 And the Spikes whipped the Quiffs 
 They're all looking 'round 
 For the last gang in town 
 Down from the edge of London 
 The rockabilly rebels came 
 From another edge of London 
 Skinhead gangs call out their name 
 And now the Zydeco kids from the high rise 
 Though they can't be recognized 
 When you hear a cajun fiddle then you're nearly in the middle 
 Of the last gang in town 
 The Crops hit the Stiffs

 Freedom's always on the run

 Guns guns killing in error 
 Guns guns, guilty hands 
 Guns guns shatter the lands 
 A system built by the sweat of the many 
 Creates assassins to kill off the few 
 Take any place and call it a court house 
 This is a place where no judge can stand 
 Sue the lawyers and burn all the papers 
 Unlock the keys of the legal rapers 
 A jury of a billion faces 
 Shouted out condemned out of hand 
 Guns guns, and nobody's kidding 
 Guns guns, or fooling around 
 Guns guns, the violence is singing 
 Guns guns, a silence the sound 
 And I like to be in Africa 
 A-beating on the final drum 
 And I like to be in U.S.S.R. 
 Making sure these things will come 
 And I like to be in U.S.A. 
 Pretending that the wars are done 
 And I like to be in Europa 
 Saying goodbye to everyone

 Never took no shit from no one, we weren't fools 
 The teacher says we're dumb, we're only having fun 
 We piss on everyone in the classroom 
 When we got thrown out, I left without much fuss 
 And weekends we'd go dancing down Streatham on the bus 
 You always made me laugh, got me in bad fights 
 Played me pool all night, smoking menthol 
 I practiced daily in my room 
 You were down at the Crown planning your next move 
 Go on a nicking spree, hit the wrong guy 
 Each of you get three years in Brixton 
 I did my very best to write 
 How was Butlins, were the screws too tight? 
 When you lot get out, we're gonna hit the town 
 We'll burn it fucking down to a cinder 
 Cause years have passed and things have changed 
 I move any way I wanna go 
 And I'll never forget the feeling I got 
 When I heard that you'd got home 
 And I'll never forget the smile on my face 
 'Cause I knew where you would be 
 And if you're in the Crown tonight 
 Have a drink on me 
 Go easy, step lightly

 But it ain't no modern miracle 
 That we found the golden rule 
 What you can't buy you gotta steal 
 And what you say can't steal, you better leave 
 I don't like to hang about in this lonely room 
 Cause London is for going out and trying to hear a tune 
 But people come pouncing up to me and say, what are you doing here? 
 You're supposed to be a star, not a cheapskate bleeding queer 
 Like a load of rats from a sinking ship 
 You slag us down to save your hip 
 But you don't give me the benefit of your doubt 
 'Cause I'll bite it off and spit it out 
 We're cheapskates, anything'll do 
 We're cheapskates, what are we supposed to do? 
 And we can rock, hey hey, let's roll 
 And we can walk and do the stroll 
 Just because we're in a group, you think we're stinking rich 
 And we all got model girls shedding every stitch 
 And you think the cocaine's flowing like a river up our noses 
 And every sea will part for us like the red one did for Moses 
 Well, I hope you make it one day 
 Just like you always said you would someday 
 And I'll get out my money and make a bet 
 That I'll be seeing you down the launderette

 A contract is a contract when they get 'em out on ya

 Laugh your life, cause there ain't much to cry for 
 All you young cunts 
 Live it now, cause there ain't much to die for 
 You gotta drag yourself to work 
 Drug yourself to sleep 
 You're dead from the neck up 
 By the middle of the week 
 Face front you got the future, shining like a piece of gold 
 But I swear as we get closer, it looks more like a lump of coal 
 But it's better than some factory, now that's no place to waste your youth 
 I worked there for a week once, I luckily got the boot

 Don't you know it is wrong to cheat Stagger, man? 
 You better stop, it is the wrong 'em boyo 
 Well, you must start all over again, all over again 
 (Don't you know it is wrong) play it Billy, play 
 {Don't you know it is wrong} play it Billy, play 
 And you will find it is the right 'em boyo 
 But if you must lie and deceit and trample people under your feet 
 Don't you know it is wrong to cheat a trying man?

40,The Clash,rock,Death Or Glory,"Now every cheap hood strikes a bargain with the world 
 And ends up making payments on a sofa or a girl 
 Love and hate tattooed across the knuckles of his hands 
 The hands that slap his kids around 'cause they don't understand how 
 Death or glory 
 Becomes just another story 
 Death or glory 
 Becomes just another story 
 And every gimmick hungry yob digging gold from rock and roll 
 Grabs the mic to tell us he'll die before he's sold 
 But I believe in this and it's been tested by research 
 That he who fucks nuns will later join the church 
 Death or glory 
 Becomes just another story 
 Death or glory 
 Becomes just another story 
 Deer in the gun's sights 
 They say, lay low 
 And you say OK 
 Don't wanna play the show 
 And all the while you're thinking: 
 ""Where's the death or glory now?"" 
 Playin' the blues with pennies 
 Sure looks better now 
 Death or glory 
 Just another story 
 Death or glory 
 Just another story 
 In every dingy basement on every dingy street 
 Every dragging hand clap over every dragging beat 
 That's just the beat of time, the beat that must go on 
 If you been trying for years then we already heard your song 
 Death or glory 
 Becomes just another story 
 Death or glory 
 Becomes just another story 
 Gonna march a long way 
 Gonna fight a long time 
 Got to travel over mountains 
 Got to travel over seas 
 We're gonna fight you, brother 
 We're gonna fight till you lose 
 We're gonna raise trouble 
 We're gonna raise hell 
 We're gonna fight you, brother 
 We're gonna raise hell 
 Death or glory 
 Becomes just another story 
 Death or glory 
 Becomes just another story 
 Death or glory 
 Just another story

 Just another story"
41,The Clash,rock,Koka Kola,"Elevator, going up! 
 In the gleaming corridors of the 51st floor 
 The money can be made if you really want some more 
 Executive decision, a clinical precision 
 Jumping from the windows, filled with indecision 
 I get good advice from the advertising world 
 Treat me nice, says the party girl 
 Coke adds life where there isn't any 
 So freeze, man, freeze 
 It's the pause that refreshes in the corridors of power 
 When top men need a top up long before the happy hour 
 Your snake skin suit and your alligator boot 
 You won't need a launderette, you can take them to the vet 
 I get good advice from the advertising world 
 Treat me nice, says the party girl 
 Coke adds life where there isn't any 
 So freeze, man, freeze 
 Coca-Cola advertising and cocaine 
 Strolling down the Broadway in the rain 
 Neon light sign says it 
 I read it in the paper, they're crazy 
 Suits your life, maybe so 
 In the White House, I know 
 All over Berlin, they've been doing it for years) 
 And in Manhattan 
 Coming through the door is a snub nose 44 
 What the barrel can't snort it can spatter on the floor 
 Your eyeballs feel like pinballs and your tongue feels like a fish 
 You're leaping from the windows, saying don't give me none of this 
 I get good advice from the advertising world 
 Treat me nice, says the party girl 
 Coke adds life where there isn't any 
 So freeze, man, freeze 
 Hit the deck!"
42,The Clash,rock,The Card Cheat,"There's a solitary man crying, hold me 
 It's only because he's lonely 
 And if the keeper of time runs slowly 
 He won't be alive for long 
 If he only had time to tell of all of the things he planned 
 With a card up his sleeve, what would he achieve? 
 It means nothing 
 To the opium dens and the bar room gins 
 In the Belmont chair, playing violins 
 The gambler's face cracks into a grin 
 As he lays down the king of spades 
 But the dealer just stares 
 There's something wrong here, he thinks 
 The gambler is seized and forced to his knees 
 And shot, dead 
 He only wanted more time 
 Away from the darkest door 
 But his luck it gave in as the dawn light crept in 
 And he lay on the floor 
 From the Hundred Year War to the Crimea 
 With a lance and a musket and a Roman spear 
 To all of the men who have stood with no fear 
 In the service of the King 
 Before you met your fate 
 Be sure you did not forsake 
 Your lover may not be around anymore 
 There's a solitary man crying, hold me 
 It's only because he's lonely 
 And if the keeper of time runs slowly 
 He won't be alive for long"
43,The Clash,rock,Lover's Rock,"You must treat your lover girl right 
 If you wanna make lover's rock 
 You must know a place you can kiss 
 To make lovers rock

 But nobody knows the poor baby's name 
 When she forgot that thing that she had 
 Oh, to swallow 
 You western man, you're free with your seed 
 When you make lovers rock 
 But whoops, there goes the strength that you need 
 To make real cool lovers rock 
 Cause a genuine lover takes off his clothes 
 And he can make a lover in a thousand go's 
 And she don't need that thing that she had 
 Oh, to swallow 
 Everybody knows it's a crying shame 
 But nobody knows the poor baby's name 
 When she forgot that thing that she had 
 Oh, to swallow 
 Oh, rock

44,The Clash,rock,Four Horsemen,"Well they were given the grapes that go ripe in the sun 
 That loosen the screws at the back of the tongue 
 But they told no one where they had begun 
 Four horsemen 
 They were given all the foods of vanity 
 And all the instant promises of immortality 
 But they bit the dust screaming insanity 
 Four horsemen 
 One was over the edge, one was over the cliff 
 One was licking 'em dry with a bloody great spliff 
 When they picked up the hiker he didn't want the lift 
 From the horsemen 
 But you, you're not searching, are you now? 
 You're not looking anyhow 
 You're never gonna ride that lonely mile 
 Or put yourself up on trial 
 Oh, you told me how your life was so bad 
 And I agree that it does seem sad 
 But that's the price that you gotta pay 
 If you're lazing all around all day 
 Four horsemen and they're coming right through 
 Four horsemen and they're pissing by you 
 They make you look like you're wearing a truss 
 Four horsemen and it's gonna be us 
 Well they gave us everything for bending the mind 
 And we cleaned out their pockets and we drank 'em blind 
 It's a long way to the finish so don't get left behind 
 By those horsemen 
 And they gave us the grapes that went ripe in the sun 
 That loosen the screws at the back of the tongue 
 But we still told nothing about what was to come 
 Four horsemen"

 That's what they say from day to day 
 Then what do all the poor do with their lives? 
 On Judgment Day with nothing to say? 
 I've been beat up, I've been thrown out 
 But I'm not down, I'm not down 
 I've been shown up, but I've grown up 
 And I'm not down, no I'm not down 
 On my own I faced a gang of jeering 
 In strange streets 
 When my nerves were pumping and I fought my fear in 
 I didn't run, I was not done 
 I've been beat up, I've been thrown out 
 But I'm not down, no I'm not down 
 I've been shown up, but I've grown up 
 And I'm not down, no I'm not down 
 And I have lived that kind of day 
 When none of your sorrows will go away 
 Go down and down and hit the floor 
 Down and down and down some more, depression 
 But I know there'll be some way 
 When I can swing everything back my way 
 Like skyscrapers rising up 
 Floor by floor, not giving up 
 So you rock around and think that you're the toughest 
 In the world, the whole wide world 
 But you're streets away from where it gets the roughest 
 You ain't been there 
 I've been beat up, I've been thrown out 
 But I'm not down, no I'm not down 
 I've been shown up, but I've grown up 
 And I'm not down, no I'm not down 
 I'm not down 
 No, I'm not down"

 So bad, bad rock, this here revolution rock 
 Careful how you slide, Clyde, all you did was glide 
 And you poured your beer in me hat 
 With my good eye on the beat, living on sensation street 
 I ain't got no time for that 
 To the cruellist mobsters in Kingstown, with the hardest eyes and the coldest tongue: Is your heart so made of rock that the blood must flow 'round the block? 
 Are you listening mobsters? Hey! 
 All people grow old, gotta die, while those kinda fools go rolling by 
 It's food for thought, mobsters 
 Young people shoot their days away 
 I've seen talent thrown away 
 All you loan sharks! 
 The organ plays and they're dancing to the brand new beat

 You didn't stand by me, no not at all 
 You didn't stand by me, no way 
 All the times when we were close 
 I'll remember these things the most 
 I see all my dreams come tumbling down 
 I can't be happy without you around 
 So alone I'll keep the wolves at bay 
 And there's only one thing I can say 
 You didn't stand by me, no not at all 
 You didn't stand by me, no way 
 You must explain why this must be

 Did you stand by me? 
 No, not at all

 I need new clothes, I need somewhere to stay 
 But without all of these things I can do 
 But without your love I won't make it through

 But tonight's the night - or didn't you know 
 That Ivan meets G.I. Joe 
 He tried his tricks- that ruskie bear 
 The united nations said it's all fair 
 He did the radiation - the chemical plague 
 But he could not win - with a cossack spin 
 The Vostok bomb - the Stalin strike 
 He tried every move - he tried to hitch hike 
 He drilled a hole - like a Russian star 
 He made every move in his repertoire 
 When Ivan meet G.I. Joe 
 Now it was G.I. Joe's turn to blow 
 He turned it on - cool and slow 
 He tried a payphone call to the pentagon 
 A radar scan - a leviathan 
 He wiped the earth - clean as a plate 
 What does it take to make a ruskie break? 
 But the crowd are bored and off they go 
 Over the road to watch china blow! 
 When Ivan meets G.I. Joe"

 Have the boys found the leak yet? 
 The molehill sets the wheel in motion 
 His downfall picks up locomotion 
 The people must have something good to read on a Sunday 
 The leader's wife takes a government car 
 In the dark to meet her minister 
 But the leader never leaves his door ajar 
 As he swings his whip from the Boer War 
 He wore a leather mask for his dinner guests 
 Totally nude and with deep respect 
 Proposed a toast to the votes he gets 
 The feeling of power and the thought of sex! 
 Now the girl let the fat man touch her 
 Vodka fumes and the feel of a vulture 
 The driver waited in the embassy car 
 The fat man's trap was set for capture 
 So the girl let the thin man touch her 
 Mixing questions, drunken laughter 
 The ministry car was waiting there 
 A minister knows his own affair 
 The people must have something good to read on a Sunday"
56,The Clash,rock,Something About England,"They say immigrants steal the hubcaps 
 Of the respected gentlemen 
 They say it would be wine and roses 
 If England were for Englishmen again 
 Well I saw a dirty overcoat 
 At the foot of the pillar of the road 
 Propped inside was an old man 
 Whom time would not erode 
 When the night was snapped by sirens 
 Those blue lights circled past 
 The dancehall called for an ambulance 
 The bars all closed up fast 
 My silence gazing at the ceiling 
 While roaming the single room 
 I thought the old man could help me 
 If he could explain the gloom 
 You really think it's all new? 
 You really think about it too? 
 The old man scoffed as he spoke to me 
 I'll tell you a thing or two 
 I missed the fourteen-eighteen war 
 But not the sorrow afterwards 
 With my father dead and my mother ran off 
 My brothers took the pay of hoods 
 The twenties turned the north was dead 
 The hunger strike came marching south 
 At the garden party not a word was said 
 The ladies lifted cake to their mouths 
 The next war began and my ship sailed 
 With battle orders writ in red 
 In five long years of bullets and shells 
 We left ten million dead 
 The few returned to old Piccadilly 
 We limped around Leicester Square 
 The world was busy rebuilding itself 
 The architects could not care 
 But how could we know when I was young 
 All the changes that were to come? 
 All the photos in the wallets on the battlefield 
 And now the terror of the scientific sun 
 There was master and servants and servants and dogs 
 They taught you how to touch your cap 
 But throught strikes and famine and war and peace 
 England never closed this gap 
 So leave me now the moon is up 
 But remember all the tales I tell 
 The memories that you have dredged up 
 Are on letters forwarded from hell 
 The streets were now deserted 
 The gangs had trudged off home 
 The lights clicked off in the bedsits 
 And old England was all alone"
57,The Clash,rock,Rebel Waltz,"I slept as I dreamed of a time long ago 
 I saw an army of rebels dancing on air 
 I dreamed as I slept, I could see the campfires 
 A song of the battle, that was born in the flames 
 And the rebels were waltzing on air 
 I danced with a girl to the tune of a waltz 
 That was written to be danced on the battlefield 
 I danced to the song of a voice of a girl 
 A voice that called ""Stand till we fall 
 We stand till all the boys fall"" 
 As we danced came the news that the war was not won 
 Five armies were coming with carriage and gun 
 Throught the heart of the camp swept the news from the front 
 A cloud crossed the moon, a child cried for food 
 We knew the war could not be won 
 So we danced with the rifle, to the rhythm of the gun 
 In a glade through the trees I saw my only one 
 Then the earth seemed to rise hell hot as the sun 
 The soldiers were dying, there was a tune to the sighing 
 The song was an old rebel one 
 As the smoke of our hopes rose high from the field 
 My eyes played tricks through the moon and the trees 
 I slept as I dreamed I saw the army rise 
 A voice began to call, ""Stand till you fall"" 
 The tune was an old rebel one"

 Take care... 
 You know you might not have 
 Too much time to spare 
 I say... 
 How long have you been acting 
 Up this way? 
 One knows... 
 When you gonna get 
 Your own floorshow 
 I'm hip... 
 And you could use a button 
 On your lip 
 Look here 
 What d'you think you're 
 Gonna be doing next year 
 I'm hip!"
59,The Clash,rock,The Crooked Beat,"Start the car lets make a midnight run 
 Across the river to South London 
 To dance to the latest hi-fi sound 
 Of bass, guitar and drum 
 Seeking out a rhythm that can take the pressure off 
 Stepping in and out of that crooked crooked beat 
 Take a piece of cloth, a coin for thirst 
 For the sweat will start to run 
 With a cymbal splash, a word of truth 
 And a rocking bass and drum 
 Seeking out a rhythm that can take the pressure on 
 Stepping in and out of that crooked crooked beat 
 So one by one they come on down 
 From the tower blocks of my home town 
 Stepping with the rhythm of the rockers beat 
 Drowning out the pressure of the crooked beat 
 Seeking out a rhythm that can take the tension on 
 Stepping in and out of that crooked crooked beat 
 It has crooked past this crooked street 
 Where cars patrol this crooked beat 
 Badges flsh and sirens wail 
 They'll be taking one and all to jail 
 Prance! Prance! You want a law to dance?"
60,The Clash,rock,Somebody Got Murdered,"Someone lights a cigarette while riding in a car 
 Some old guy takes a swig and passes back the jar 
 But where they were last night, no one can remember 
 Somebody got murdered -- goodbye, for keeps, forever 
 Somebody got murdered 
 Somebody's dead forever 
 And you're minding your own business, carrying spare change 
 You wouldn't cosh a barber, you're hungry all the same 
 I've been very tempted to grab it from the till 
 I've been very hungry, but not enough to kill 
 Somebody got murdered 
 Somebody's dead forever 
 Somebody got murdered, his name cannot be found 
 A small stain on the pavement, they'll scrub it off the ground 
 As the daily crowd disperses, no one says that much 
 Somebody got murdered and it left me with a touch 
 Somebody got murdered 
 Somebody's dead forever 
 Sounds like murder 
 Those shouts 
 Are they drunk down below? 
 Sounds like murder 
 Those screams 
 Are they drunk down below? 
 It's late, and my watch stopped 
 Some time ago 
 Sounds like murder 
 Those screams 
 Are they drunk down below?"
61,The Clash,rock,One More Time,"Must I get a witness for all this misery? 
 There's no need to brothers everybody can see 
 That it's one more time in the ghetto you know 
 One more time if you please now 
 One more time to the dying man 
 They say one more time if you please 
 The old lady kicks karate 
 For just a little walk down the street 
 The little baby he knows kung fu 
 He tries it on those he meets 
 'Cause it's a one more time! 
 You don't need no silicone to calculate poverty 
 Watch when Watts town burns again 
 The bus goes to Montgomery 
 'Cause it's a one more time in the ghetto 
 One more time if you please 
 One more time for the dying man 
 One more time to be free"
62,The Clash,rock,One More Dub,"Stop wastin' time 
 Right 
 One more breath 
 One more time in the ghetto

 One more time"
63,The Clash,rock,Lightning Strikes (Not Once But Twice),"Now lightning strikes in old 
 New York 
 It may be dark but I wanna talk 
 It might rain, it might snow 
 Too many things I got to know 
 If this is spring than it's time to sing 
 Never mind the l'il birdies wing 
 Look out, look out, old New York 
 New York's coming an' New York talks 
 Hey! Strike! Not once... 
 Strike! But twice! 
 Get out your money - peel a slab 
 Roll some notes an' hail a cab 
 Drive in church drive in back 
 Drive down Seventh in a tank 
 Take in the sights, feel the breeze 
 See New York's one and only tree 
 It can be found in Garbage park 
 But don't inspect it after dark 
 Strike! New York! Lightning! 
 Not once but twice. 
 Accidental hike in the transit strike 
 Roller skate or ride a bike 
 Three to a car, Brooklyn Bridge 
 You won't get far if you're privileged 
 Graffiti Jack sprays in black 
 An Englishman can he read it back? 
 Deli Joe he ought to know 
 He runs the gang on Pastrami Row 
 Strike! Lightning strike! 
 Because glass to glass, street to street 
 Buildings touch St. Peter's feet 
 From car to bar, prez to shah 
 Everything is in the jar 
 The 4 winds blow 'cause the 4 winds know 
 Takes a special hustle to make a roll 
 Honey girl on her feet 
 I wish everything to make her sweet 
 Strike! Twice! OK so roll! 
 From Harlem! Strike one! 
 Harlem slum to penthouse block 
 On every door I already knocked 
 There wasn't anybody that I didn't leave alone 
 Somebody lying under every stone 
 Everything that a man could need 
 In a bag down by my knee 
 That looks good, this ain't got seeds 
 Cheaper than booze down in the bowery 
 Lightning strike! Old New York! 
 Everything's light! Strike! 
 Hey ho such a night 
 I'll see y'all when the lightning strike 
 A polaroid caught in the act 
 You're married too and that's a fact 
 But I won't peek and I won't squeek 
 Down by the trucks on Christopher Street 
 It's Cuban Day - Oi Vey 
 Chinese New Year let's call it a day 
 Tootsie! Hey Chi man! 
 That melody is Puerto Rican 
 Hey Chi man is what he's speaking 
 An' there's the road down into London Town 
 Where many cars get broken down 
 It's the Westway from Ladbroke Grove 
 Runs down to Old Hounslow 
 Just thought I'd mention the new extension 
 That run's down the 59th street intersection 
 Did you hear the news y'all? 
 London Town on the Broadway!"
64,The Clash,rock,Up In Heaven (Not Only Here),"The towers of London, these crumbling rocks 
 Reality estates that the hero's got 
 And every hour's maked by the chime of a clock 
 And whatcha gonna do when the darkness surrounds? 
 You can piss in the lifts which have broken down 
 You can watch from the debris the last bedroom light 
 We're invisible here just past midnight 
 The wives hate their husbands and their husbands don't care 
 Their children daub slogans to prove they lived there 
 A giant pipe organ up in the air 
 You can't live in a home which should not have been built 
 By the bourgeoise clerks who bear no guilt 
 When the wind hits this building this building it tilts 
 One day it will surely fall to the ground... 
 Fear is just another commodity here 
 They sell us peeping holes to peek when we hear 
 A bang on the door resoundingly clear 
 Who would really want to move in here? 
 The children play faraway, the corridors are bare 
 This room is a cage it's like captivity 
 How can anyone exist in such misery? 
 It has been said not only here 
 ""Allianza dollars are spent 
 To raise the towering buildings 
 For the weary bones of the workers 
 To go back in the morning 
 To be strong in the morning"""

 Beat the drums tonight, Alphonso 
 Spread the news all over the grove 
 The big meeting has decided 
 That total was must burn on the grove 
 Does it mean I should take my machete 
 To chop my way through the path of life? 
 Does it mean I should run with the dog pack 
 Is that the way to be the one to survive? 
 Never need a gun says Tai Chi 
 Move on up to dragon snaps his tail 
 Fall back on still waters 
 Hammer with his eye on the nail

66,The Clash,rock,Let's Go Crazy,"Summon up the mas! Play on the pan! 
 Staring dreads are jerking their locks 
 As the white star liner sank in the docks 
 But on the drummers face, there is a look of dread 
 As he drums away 400 years of dread 
 The dancer man-in the power of mas 
 Is smoking ti the mighty sparrow's blast 
 But you better be careful 
 You still got to watch yourself 
 You wanna be crazy 
 So you wanna go crazy 
 Let's go crazy 
 So you wanna be crazy 
 Then let's go crazy 
 Let's go crazy 
 The lawful force are here of course 
 For special offenders for the special court 
 But the young men know when the sun has set 
 Darkness comes to settle the debt 
 Owed by a year of S.U.S. and suspect 
 Indiscriminate use of the power of arrest 
 They're waiting for the sun to set 
 The mighty observer who keeps his cabinets hot 
 A great meeting of rhythm and face 
 A humming of values and a children's place 
 But the sticks man gives the copper good excuse 
 To shut off the ganja and control the juice 
 To control the juice 
 So you wanna go crazy? Then let's go crazy 
 So take it on crazy! So they get all crazy 
 Bricks and bottles corrugated iron 
 Shields and helmets carnival time

 Ray symbolic from jamdown town"

 It's in neon lights an' global rights 
 Frank? He's on the phone 
 There ain't no German girl outside 
 But who cares when its warm inside? 
 With music 
 Special mystery of music tragically 
 Exchanging slaves for majesties 
 Modern waves of tragedy 
 Packing a to pience colt pair of shoots 
 A shiny grey Mexican suit 
 The blue eyed traffic can sashay by 
 'Cause tonight the sailor boys have hit Shanghai 
 The kick-out traffic goes creaking by 
 I smash my glass and shout shanghi 
 My drummer friend comes shooting by 
 He said Errol Flynn will never die 
 Oh no! Who am I to question why? 
 And are you lonesome tonight 
 And do ya need a country cowboy 
 Who's just thin and tight in those 
 Brrrr bus depot jeans 
 With a squirt resistant stud stud 
 Hey stoner 
 Get over there in the spliffbunker one 
 Becos London Bridge was sold somehow 
 But it was too old anyhow 
 When Uncle Sam has broken down 
 We'll make him down in old Japan 
 Say yeee 
 Well there ain't no better blend 
 Than Joe Ely and his Texas Men 
 Where the wind blows 
 I ain't seen none like that scenery 
 You can see from a bus if you pay the price 
 Wave my arms around 
 Flag one of those taxi's maybe 
 I saw a girl somewhere somehow 
 Forever sticks in my mind somehow 
 I've just got three lines

 You cast

 Got in trouble so he's going out 
 Mixing up and Haiti! Oh!

 Say it all in one go 
 Occasionally once or twice 
 A day I feel alive enough to say 
 Let's hear what the drummerman's 
 Got to say about 
 He said is it Errol Flynn's birthday or not? 
 Sept 12 until October 
 If they pack 2 piece 
 Colt pair of shoots 
 We got the shiny grey Mexican suits 
 I'm just wasting a great big 
 Corporation and the entire fund 
 The girders of Wall Street 
 And thetemples of money 
 And the high priests 
 Of the expense account 
 And I'm wasting the whole thing

 The walls of Jericho 
 The winds of fear 
 Whip away the sickness 
 The messages on the tablet 
 Was Valium 
 As the planets form 
 That golden cross Lord 
 I'll see you on 
 The Holy Cross Roads 
 After all this time 
 To believe in Jesus 
 After all those drugs 
 I thought I was Him 
 After all my lying 
 And a-crying 
 And my suffering 
 I ain't good enough 
 I ain't clean enough 
 To be Him 
 The tribal wars 
 Burning up the homeland 
 The fuel of evil 
 Is raining from the sky 
 The sea of lava 
 Flowing down the mountain 
 The time will sweep 
 Us sinners by 
 Holy rollers roll 
 Give generously now 
 Pass the hubcap please

 Second comes the nation

 They fucked the operation 
 Cooking up the books 
 A respected occupation 
 The anchor and foundation of multi-corporations

 In these days in the firmament 
 I look for signs that are permanent 
 In these days with no love to give 
 The world will turn with no one left to live 
 In these days I don't know what to do 
 The more I see the more I'm destitute 
 In these days I don't know what to sing 
 The more I know the less my tune can swing 
 In these days you can get no rice 
 No razor blades but you can get knife 
 In these days see the people run 
 They have no food but the boy have gun"
79,The Clash,rock,The Street Parade,"When I was waiting for your phone call 
 The one that never came 
 Like a man about to burst 
 I was dying of thirst 
 Though I will never fade 
 Or get lost in this daze 
 Though I will disappear 
 Into the street parade 
 It's not too hard to cry 
 In these crying times 
 I'll take a broken heart 
 And take it home in parts 
 But I will never fade 
 I was in this place 
 By the first church of the city 
 I saw tears on the face 
 The face of a visionary 
 Though I will disappear 
 To join the street parade 
 Disappear and fade 
 Into the street parade"
80,The Clash,rock,Version City,"There is a train at Version City 
 Waiting for the rhythm mail 
 If you can jump then jump right now 
 She can pull you through to better days 
 Is that the train that the speak off 
 The one I heard in my younger days 
 All great bluesmen have rode her 
 I'm jumping up gonna ride that train 
 There's a lonely soul out on the crossroads 
 He's waiting there in the pouring rain 
 He's looking for that great ride yeh 
 That'll take him to oh what's her name 
 So I rode that train from Version City 
 For ninety-nine an' one half days 
 Never heard such rhythm sound 
 It was in my soul which was on the train 
 We went straight through Syndrum Inc. 
 Up an' over the Acapella Pass 
 Then Gibson Town and Fenderville 
 All stations to the Mesa Boogie Ranch 
 We saw that soul out on the cross roads 
 Waitin' there in the pouring rain 
 We called hey engine slow your rhythms 
 See he wants to ride the version train 
 We rode that train from Version City 
 For ninety-nine and one half years 
 I never seen such funky country 
 While riding with the engineers 
 Could not fill no application 
 Before I rode this rhythm train 
 Could not work at my station 
 Before I rode the version train 
 There is a train at Version City 
 Waiting for the rhythm mail 
 If you can jump then jump right now 
 She can pull you through to better days"

 Beaming waves from the sea

 Back to watch the day to day 
 Saga of working people 
 Hanging out the washing, clipping coupons 
 And generally being decent 
 Johnny Too Bad 
 meets 
 Johnny B. Goode 
 In the charing cross road 
 The only thing that happened today 
 Says the west end jungle code 
 And all the Germans and all the French 
 Jam themselves down the tube 
 And re-enact the second world war 
 While the rude boys get rude 
 And I look to my left 
 And I look to my right 
 And I'm looking for a man 
 I'm looking for a sign 
 I don't wanna be the Prisoner 
 I don't wanna be the Prisoner 
 I don't wanna be the Prisoner 
 I don't wanna be the Prisoner 
 The Prisoner lives in Camden town 
 Selling revolution 
 The Prisoner loads his tracking arm up 
 With self disillusion 
 Your mother does the washing up 
 Your old man digs the garden 
 You're only free to dodge the cops 
 And bunk the train to stardom 
 And I look to my left 
 And I look to my right

 Just like I know mine"" 
 While all the windows stare ahead 
 An' the streets are filled with dread 
 Every nation in the world 
 Slinks through the alley after girls 
 What we wear is dangerous gear 
 It'll get you picked on anywhere 
 Though we get beat up we don't care 
 At least it livens up the air 
 But some days we hide inside 
 All courage gone and paralyzed 
 Sniff that wind of ugly tension 
 Today the jerks have got aggression 
 Yeah, today the jerks have got aggression

 And sweeping smoke from cigarettes 
 And what is that funky multinational anthem 
 Rocking from a thousand King Kong cassette decks? 
 Then this shy boy from Missouri 
 Boots blown off in a '60s war 
 Riding aluminium crutches, now he knows the welfare kindness 
 And Agent Orange color blindness as he works from door to door 
 The violence in the carpets 
 The arrows of his wife in a car jam 
 Drives the slum-bum dweller 
 To grind his hunting knife in a car jam 
 In homesteads of cigar box 
 Radios, hive like bees in a car jam 
 The body in the icebox 
 Has no date for freeze in a car jam 
 In a car jam 
 Selling is what selling sells 
 But only saints of the seven avenues 
 Can sell the seven hells 
 Fanning the drug afflicted leperizing zone 
 Once inside 
 The executive 
 It never leaves his home 
 Gorillas drag their victims 
 Hyenas try to sue in a car jam 
 Snakes find grass in concrete 
 There is no city zoo in a car jam 
 Ventilation units 
 Where towers meet the streets in a car jam 
 The ragged stand in bags 
 Soaking heat up through their feet in a car jam 
 This was the only kindness 
 And it was accidental too 
 In a car jam 
 In a car jam 
 Now shaking single-engined planes 
 Trafficking stereos from Cuba 
 Buzzed the holy zealot mass 
 And drowned out Missa Luba 
 And drowned out Missa Luba 
 And drowned out Missa Luba 
 And drowned out Missa Luba 
 And drowned out Missa Luba 
 I thought I saw Lauren Bacall 
 I thought I saw Lauren Bacall in a car jam

 Where Jack feeds on the birds of night 
 Not even bubbies bicycling two by two 
 Can stop the blood and feathers flying 
 Wearing overalls and for once and for all

 Yeah, I bet you are 
 Hands up for Hollywood 
 Hooray!

 You saved the girl

98,The Clash,rock,Atom Tan,"Now the corporations stopped! 
 Stopped pushing fast food 
 Been a multiple shooting 
 Downtown at the bank 
 Reluctantly the panic begins 
 To catch fire 
 But it did not affect 
 The steady sale of junk 
 The state office looked 
 It looked like Hollywood 
 With make-up bleeding all over the cracks 
 Wo he blew his lines 
 Facing the cameras 
 He suffered the first 
 All live heart attack 
 Oh you've caught an even atom tan 
 The motor-cyanide 
 Cyanide suicide 
 He finally found the brick wall in his life 
 Shining up his engine 
 He dressed right up for it 
 At the top of the speedo 
 He crumpled the bike 
 There's plenty people runnin' runnin' for cover- 
 Hoping at best to hold off all the rest 
 Once last stand at the bunker fire 
 Machine gun and pitchfork at breast 
 Oh you've caught an even atom tan 
 But it isn't so easy 
 So easy for lovers 
 Chained in love stained 
 At the top of the tower 
 The pink hearse is leaving at funeral speed 
 Driving your heart 
 Away with the flowers 
 All night I waited 
 I waited for a horseman 
 His ever faithful 
 His Indian friend 
 I'm not the only one 
 Of the caped crusader fan club watching the sky 
 For mankind's prayers 
 Oh you've caught an even atom tan 
 Calamine"

 When the past was always a closing door

 They filled the sky with a tropical storm. 
 You know he head the drums of war 
 Each man knows what he's looking for"

 Obeys the sergeant at arms whatever he says 
 The sergeant will for his sergeant's pay 
 Obey the captain till his dying day 
 The captain will for his captain's pay 
 Obey the generals order of battle play 
 The generals bow to the government 
 Obey the charge you must not relent 
 What of the neighbors and the prophets in bars? 
 What are they saying in the public bazaar? 
 We are tired of the tune 
 You must not relent 
 At every stroke of the bell in the tower there goes 
 Another boy from another side 
 The bulletins that steady come in say those 
 Familiar words at the top of the hour 
 The jamming city increases its hum 
 And those terrible words continue to come 
 Through brass music of government hear those 
 Guns tattoo a roll on the drums 
 No one mentions the neighboring war 
 No one knows what they're fighting for 
 We are tired of the tune 
 You must not relent 
 (There's this different kind of chemical system, ""2000 Flushes."" Keeps the water crystal clear, keeps the bowl sparkling clean continuously for about 4 months. No rings, no streaks, no stains just put the container in your tank and forget it!

102,The Clash,rock,Death Is A Star,"And I was gripped by that deadly phantom 
 I followed him through hard jungles 
 As he stalked through the back lots 
 Strangling through the night shades 
 The thief of life 
 Moved onwards and outwards to love 
 In a one stop only motel 
 A storm bangs on the cheapest room 
 The phantom slips in to spill blood 
 Even on the sweetest honeymoon 
 The killer of love 
 Caught the last late Niagara bus 
 By chance or escaping from misery 
 By suddeness or in answer to pain 
 Smoking in the dark cinema 
 See the bad go down again 
 And the clouds are high in Spanish mountains 
 And a Ford roars through the night full of rain 
 The killer's blood flows 
 But he loads his gun again 
 Make a grown man cry like a girl 
 To see the guns dying at sunset 
 In vain lovers claimed 
 That they never have met 
 Smoking in the dark cinema 
 See the bad go down again"

 Yes I am the liquidator I carry the old Beretta

 You know how dangerous that can be

 And they used to run wild in the streets 
 But now I am the voice 
 Howling from your radio 
 From my armour plated Cadillac 
 You'll hear what I say goes 
 Yes I am the dictator I satisfy the U.S. team 
 I always do my killing in the woods and keep the city gutters clean 
 'Cause I need a few more dollars 
 For my fighter pilot to be free 
 To dive bomb on the population 
 If they go running wild in the streets 
 Yes I am that voice... etc. 
 Yes I am the crusador I spent twenty years in exile 
 But now I am the invader and I'm never never gonna die

 Better times had to come 
 Fate lay in the hands that clap 
 The muscles that move and the power that raps 
 He went up on money street 
 Waving an poping to the beat 
 Off his wits an on his feet 
 He worked a coin from the cold concrete 
 Movers and shakers come on you got what it takes to make it 
 Movers an shakers come on even if you have to fake it 
 Where the highway meets the lights 
 With a red bandanna and rapid wipes 
 He shines glass and he cleans chrome 
 He'll accept what he gets thrown 
 This man earns 'cause its understood 
 Times are bad and he's makin' good 
 Down on him but he's got it beat 
 He's working coin from the cold concrete 
 Movers and shakers come on... etc 
 And when I see you down & I say 
 That ain't no way through that ain't no way through 
 Movers and shakers come on... etc 
 Way back in some city heat 
 When a friend was anybody with food to eat 
 It was lousy life with a leaking roof 
 We got up to find that truth 
 Make a drum from a garbage can 
 Allow your tongue to be a man 
 When the beat propels you off your seat 
 You got it made in the cold concrete 
 Movers and shakers come on!"

 This knife of Sheffield steel 
 This is England 
 This is how we feel 
 Time on his hands freezing in those clothes 
 He won't go for the carrot 
 They beat him by the pole 
 Some sunny day confronted by his soul 
 He's out at sea, too far off, he can't go home 
 This is England 
 What we're supposed to die for 
 This is England 
 And we're never gonna cry no more 
 Black shadow of the Vincent 
 Falls on a Triumph line 
 I got my motorcycle jacket 
 But I'm walking all the time 
 South Atlantic wind blows 
 Ice from a dying creed 
 I see no glory 
 When will we be free 
 This is England 
 We can chain you to the rail 
 This is England 
 We can kill you in a jail 
 The British boots go kick them 
 Got 'em in the head 
 Police ain't watchin'

 They discovered one black Saturday 
 That mobs don't march they run 
 So you can excuse the nervous triggerman 
 Just this once for jumping the gun 
 As they were picking up the dead 
 Out of the broken glass 
 Yes it's number one, the radio said 
 Groovy times have come to pass! 
 Groovy times groovy times groovy times 
 The intake is on the uptake 
 The acceleration's pretty grim

 I should be jumpin' shoutin' that I made it all this way 
 From Camden town station to 44th and 8th 
 Not many make it this far and many say we're great 
 But just like them we walk on an' we can't escape our fate 
 Can't you hear the sighing 
 Eastside Jimmy and Southside Sue 
 Both say they needed something new 
 So I'm standing at the gates of the west 
 I burn money at the lights of the sign 
 The city casts a shadow of the perfect crime 
 I'm standing at the gates of the east 
 I take my pulse and the pulse of my friend 
 The city casts a shadow, will I see you again? 
 The immigrants an' remnants of all the glory years 
 Are clustered around the bar again for another round of beers 
 Little Richard's in the kitchen playing spoons and plates 
 He's telling the waitress he's great 
 Ah say I know somewhere back'n'forth in time 
 Out on the dustbowls, deep in the roulette mine 
 Or in a ghetto cellar only yesterday 
 There's a move into the future for the USA. 
 I hear them crying 
 Eastside Jimmy and Southside Sue 
 Both said they needed something new 
 Standing at the gates of the west 
 In the shadow again

 In fact the city seems to be gone! 
 Burning rubber and smoke in my eyes 
 There's a flat burning junkheap 
 For twenty square miles! 
 They took it into the nuclear mine 
 Judging by this, they left nothing behind 
 Down in the bunkers in the crust of the earth 
 Now crouch the wealthy and the noble of birth 
 If I could a ride a train around the city 
 That holds this as our fate 
 I'd hide from electro-circuit central 
 To the shock inducer gate 
 Not forgetting the by-pass 
 Across the Washington hooks 
 Through the phones and desks and screens 
 Of the kremlin's crook of crooks 
 There's some panel in a circuit board 
 Destination of the override 
 Scanning the wild wind 
 Blowing through the Berlin corridor 
 Spotlit in a palace, shielded from dust 
 Malfunction or not, the failsafe is the crux 
 So far away from us, 
 Shaking with the mystery tears 
 One lonely night in ladbroke grove 
 Far away in the deserts of Omaha! 
 They got it nailed down-swiss tight! 
 The bank notes of Europe 
 The emperors and kings 
 Curl in the autumn as the burning of leaves 
 And I've cleaned my black guitar..."

 Boiled the blood in my eyes

 Took three million worldwide 
 To make him understand 
 You don't work for peanuts 
 But they'll push you too 
 It's that company trick 
 We're all jumping through 
 Bet you ain't had no food now 
 Since you last went to sleep 
 The wild seed that was sowed 
 Will take forever to reap 
 What days and nights though? 
 Rocking out of ham yard 
 Oh skip that fandango 
 Bring the blues back down hard 
 Though Chuck would never admit it 
 At the door of the jail 
 There stood Guy Stevens 
 And he was waving the bail 
 Guy you've finished the booze 
 And we've run out of speed 
 But the wild side of life 
 Is the one that we need"

 Confess in the tile house

 I'm a man of means by no means 
 King of the road 
 Third box-car on the midnight tube 
 Destination Hangar Lane 
 Old worn out suit and shoes 
 I don't pay no union blues 
 I smoke old stogies I have found 
 Short but not to big around 
 Man of means by no means 
 King a' the road"
141,The Clash,rock,Love Kills,"Walking out of England thinking you were king taking on this world 
 On that bus that goes through Mexico a killer love finds a sweet Mexican girl 
 But in Mississippi we rushed into the room 
 Down in Dixie you were crying for dope 
 Down in Alabama they like home cooked fare yeah 
 So we're gonna strap you to the fryin' chair yeah 
 But I don't know what love is 
 Is there something else giving me the chills? 
 But if my hands are the color of blood 
 Then, Baby, I can tell ya sure I can tell ya 
 Love kills 
 Love Kills 
 Love kills 
 Love Kills 
 Do you wanna hear all the sirens of the city drown the arguing? 
 We're on riker's island on a population board 
 They don't care about your fame 
 On the Rio Grande they'll tie you to a tree 
 Ooh-oh-oh x2 
 And you can't call the lawyers 'cause the whorehouse is asleep 
 Oh-oh-oh x2 
 You people will get weak 
 Oh-oh-oh x2 
 They'll throw you in a cell where you can barely breathe 
 Oh-oh-oh x2"
142,The Clash,rock,Outside Broadcast,"Buenas dias senores y senoritas 
 Esta noche estamos radio clash 
 Y tota la jente hold on tight! 
 This is radio clash - everybody hold on tight 
 Buzz, buzz, talk to me buzz 
 What is your new girl like? 
 World, world, speak to me world 
 Your lion sleeps tonight 
 This is radio clash - everybody hold on tight 
 Jungle fever, boy and girl 
 In city streets tonight 
 Soul rescue at the function hall 
 Could the word come true tonight? 
 This is radio clash 
 This is radio clash - everybody hold on tight 
 Said the jungle boys an' make no noise 
 Someone's killed by dawn 
 The jungle plain and the rhythm of the rain 
 This storm will soon be gone 
 This is radio clash - everybody hold on tight 
 I am the lord of the dance 
 The lord of the dance I be 
 (???) Can say I'm the (???) 
 An' I center all my energy 
 This is radio clash - everybody hold on tight 
 This is radio clash - everybody hold on tight 
 Are speakers built to take the strain? 
 Hello, hello this is rent-a-world 
 Your last check did not come through 
 Seven days of final bills 
 Your last check did not come through 
 This is radio clash - everybody hold on tight 
 One, two, three, four 
 This sound does 
 Urban vietnam 
 Underneath the mushroom cloud 
 My humanity 
 Hands of law 
 Free 
 This is radio clash 
 This is not free 
 Nor an armed force 
 Can we get that world to listen 
 Orbiting your living room 
 Everybody hold on tight 
 Go back to urban 'nam"
143,The Clash,rock,Pouring Rain,"(Strummer) 
 I could see as I rode in 
 The ships were gone and the pit fell in (inaudible) 
 A funeral bell tolled the hour in 
 A lonely drunkard slumbering 
 Not even the twang of the guitar 
 Not even the siren wail of pain 
 Not even the shadows of desire 
 Caught in the pouring pouring rain 
 Breeze black windows on dead street 
 Where I was lived up on the cheap 
 (Yeah, say!) Ask no questions, work and sleep 
 Till the old tango that's on date street 
 I can hear the sharpen of the pain 
 Some lucky stranger in the rain 
 Hear the shouting of the rain 
 Lucky stranger... in the rain! 
 Hammers beat in dusty times 
 On these weedy rusted lines 
 Mocking the sun and optimistic signs 
 All these weedy gates of iron 
 The sun won't shine my way again 
 My lucky moon was on the wane 
 Oh I never saw a star again 
 In the pouring pouring rain 
 A salty band played in the train 
 A sad trombone and some refrain 
 The future pointed to the weather vane 
 The old calypso died of shame 
 I hear the shouting of the pain 
 Some lucky stranger in the rain 
 Hear the shouting of the pain 
 Lucky stranger - pouring rain 
 Pouring rain!"
144,The Clash,rock,Return To Brixton,"When they kick out your front door 
 How you gonna come? 
 With your hands on your head 
 Or on the trigger of your gun 
 When the law break in 
 How you gonna go? 
 Shot down on the pavement 
 Or waiting in death row 
 You can crush us 
 You can bruise us 
 But you'll have to answer to 
 Ooh, guns of Brixton 
 The money feels good 
 And your life you like it well 
 But surely your time will come 
 As in heaven, as in hell 
 You see, he feels like Ivan 
 Born under the Brixton sun 
 His game is called survivin' 
 At the end of the harder they come 
 You know it means no mercy 
 They caught him with a gun 
 No need for the Black Maria 
 Goodbye to the Brixton sun 
 You can crush us 
 You can bruise us 
 But you'll have to answer to 
 Ooh, the guns of Brixton 
 Ooh, the guns of Brixton 
 Ooh, the guns of Brixton 
 Ooh, the guns of Brixton 
 You can crush us 
 You can bruise us 
 And even shoot us 
 But ooh, the guns of Brixton 
 Shot down on the pavement 
 Waiting in death row 
 His game was survivin' 
 As in heaven, as in hell 
 You can crush us 
 You can bruise us 
 But really must you shoot us? 
 Ooh, the guns of Brixton 
 Ooh, the guns of Brixton 
 Ooh, the guns of Brixton 
 Ooh, the guns of Brixton 
 Ooh, the guns of Brixton 
 Ooh, the guns of Brixton 
 Ooh, the guns of Brixton"
