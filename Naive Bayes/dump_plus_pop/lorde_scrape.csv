 Deep in the fantasies and dreams of the wits

 Take the pill make it too ill 
 The other day I forgot my old address 
 I'm sitting pretty on the throne 
 There's nothing more I want 
 Except to be alone 
 Be a part of the love club 
 Everything will glow for you 
 You'll get punched for the love club 
 For the love club 
 Your clothes are soaked and you don't know where to go 
 So drop your chin and take yourself back home 
 And roll out your maps and papers 
 Find out your hiding places again 
 The only problem that I got with the club 
 Is how you've severed from the people who watched you grow up 
 When you're a member, go on your great adventure again 
 They will be waiting at the end 
 Be a part of the love club 
 Everything will glow for you 
 You'll get punched for the love club

 Use our eyes, throw our hands overboard 
 I am your sweetheart psychopathic crush 
 Drink up your movements, still I can't get enough 
 I overthink your p-punctuation use 
 Not my fault, just a thing that my mind do 
 A rush at the beginning 
 I get caught up, just for a minute 
 But lover, you're the one to blame, all that you're doing 
 Can you hear the violence? 
 Megaphone to my chest 
 Broadcast the boom boom boom boom and make 'em all dance to it 
 Broadcast the boom boom boom boom and make 'em all dance to it 
 Broadcast the boom boom boom boom and make 'em all dance to it 
 Broadcast the boom boom boom boom and make 'em all dance to it 
 Broadcast the boom boom boom boom and make 'em all dance to it 
 Our thing progresses 
 I call and you come through 
 Blow all my friendships 
 To sit in hell with you 
 But we're the greatest 
 They'll hang us in the Louvre 
 Down the back, but who cares - still the Louvre 
 Okay I know that you are not my type (still I fall) 
 I'm just the sucker who let you fill her mind (but what about love?) 
 Nothing wrong with it 
 Supernatural 
 Just move in close to me, closer, you'll feel it coasting

 Says it was poison

 Into the arms of the girl that I love 
 The only love I haven't screwed up 
 She's so hard to please 
 But she's a forest fire 
 I do my best to meet her demands 
 Play at romance, we slow dance 
 In the living room, but all that a stranger would see 
 Is one girl swaying alone 
 Stroking her cheek 
 They say, ""You're a little much for me 
 You're a liability 
 You're a little much for me"" 
 So they pull back, make other plans 
 I understand, I'm a liability 
 Get you wild, make you leave 
 I'm a little much for 
 E-a-na-na-na, everyone 
 The truth is I am a toy 
 That people enjoy 
 'Til all of the tricks don't work anymore 
 And then they are bored of me 
 I know that it's exciting 
 Running through the night, but 
 Every perfect summer's 
 Eating me alive until you're gone 
 Better on my own 
 They say, ""You're a little much for me

 I light all the candles 
 Cut flowers for all my rooms 
 I care for myself the way I used to care about you 
 These days, we kiss and we keep busy 
 The waves come after midnight 
 I call from underwater 
 Why even try to get right? 
 When you've outgrown a lover 
 The whole world knows but you 
 It's time to let go of this endless summer afternoon
