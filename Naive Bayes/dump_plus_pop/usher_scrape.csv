13,Usher,pop,Final Goodbye,"It's time to say goodbye 
 It's over now 
 It's time to say goodbye 
 Is there a reason why our love could not last 
 I ask was it too strong for you to hold on pretty 
 Lady 
 I thought we had a master plan 
 But it takes a stronger man to walk away 
 Than to watch our love fade away 
 I often wonder how and why 
 I did not cheat I did not lie 
 I hope you know how hard I tried 
 But it's over for now 
 It's time to say goodbye 
 I can't believe how suddenly things change 
 Yesterday we were in love but all I feel were 
 Heartaches 
 And pain 
 Day and night I tried deep inside to work things out 
 But in my heart I knew 
 I still had my doubts 
 I thought we made a symphony 
 It's over now no more harmony 
 I prayed so hard for love to fly (oh yeah) 
 It's time to say goodbye

 Yo See, it's rare that you find people like us

 Any and everything you want to

 Say whatever you want but she still gon' get it up

 And new kick's bitch y'all all up in my mix

 Catchin' bricks don't concern me 
 So forget young midget, My minds on 7 digits 
 Before I pay heaven's skies a visit, now dig it 
 I'm pullin' all stops 
 Knockin' down all spots 
 Sayin' you can't front on me 
 So from this day forth you know It's all about me 
 And what I do be the major league 
 That's why your girlfriend's paging me 
 And she know like you know, you don't see her like I see her 
 So she's out the do'.

 I know you gotta man

 Man it's been a long time coming 
 But I never forgot about you 
 I'm here 
 Yeah, we've traveled the world 
 Seen a lot of places, so many faces 
 We had a good time - we've grown together 
 Who would've thought we'd stay down this long, heh? 
 This is my chance to share my world with you 
 And I know you're gonna like it 
 Are you ready?"

 See the thing about you that caught my eye 
 Is the same thing that makes me change my mind 
 Kinda hard to explain, but girl, I'll try 
 You need to sit down this may take a while 
 See this girl, she sorta looks just like you 
 She even smiles just the way you do 
 So innocent she seemed, but I was fooled 
 I'm reminded when I look at you 
 But you remind of a girl that I once knew 
 See her face whenever I, I look at you 
 You wouldn't believe all of the things that she put me through 
 (oh no no no) 
 This is why I just can't get with you 
 Thought that she was the one for me 
 Till I found out she was on her creep 
 Ooh, she was sexing everyone but me 
 This is why we could never be

 See her face whenever I, I look at you 
 You wouldn't believe all of the things she put me through

 That I relate her ignorance to you 
 Wish I knew, wish I knew how to separate the two 
 You remind me, whoa 
 You remind of a girl that I once knew 
 See her face whenever I, I look at you 
 You wouldn't believe all of the things she put me through 
 This is why I just can't get with you

38,Usher,pop,U Got It Bad,"Oh, no, no, no, no 
 No, no, no, no 
 When you feel it in your body 
 You found somebody who makes you change your ways 
 Like hanging with your crew 
 Said you act like you're ready 
 But you don't really know 
 And everything in your past, you wanna let it go 
 I've been there, done it, humped around 
 After all that, this is what I found 
 Nobody wants to be alone 
 If you're touched by the words in this song, then baby 
 U got, u got it bad 
 When you're on the phone 
 Hang up and you call right back 
 U got, u got it bad

 Your whole life's off track 
 You know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house 
 You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about 
 U got it bad when you're out with someone 
 But you keep on thinkin' bout somebody else 
 U got it bad 
 When you say that you love 'em and you really know 
 Everything that used to matter, don't matter no more 
 Like my money, all my cars 
 (you can have it all back) 
 Flowers, cards and candy 
 (I do it just cause I'm-) 
 Said I'm fortunate to have you girl 
 I want you to know, I really adore you 
 All my people who know what's going on 
 Look at your mate, help me sing my song 
 Tell her I'm your man, you're my girl 
 I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world 
 Ladies say I'm you girl, you're my man 
 Promise to love you the best I can 
 I've been there, done it, humped around 
 After all that, this is what I found 
 Everyone of y'all are just like me 
 It's too bad that you can't see 
 That you got it bad, hey

 Hang up and you call right back

 All the material things 
 That I thought that would make you happy 
 I'm confused can you make me understand 
 'Cause I tried to give you the best of me

 But never took time to see 
 Will you help me? 
 Tell me what you want from me 
 Can you help me? 
 Tell me why you want to leave

 (Oh girl) I need you come back home (you know I need you) I don't want to be alone 
 Girl, I put your love up on the shelf 
 And I guess I just left it to die 
 Now we're not together 
 'Cause I hurt you too many times 
 And now your not around 
 I wish for every moment in time 
 That I wasted we used it to make sweet love 
 Baby, be my guide please take my hand 
 Want you to know that 
 I got you if you need it 
 I don't want to be on the outside looking in 
 I got to have you girl, can't you see 
 Will you help me? 
 Tell me what you want from me 
 Can you help me? 
 Tell me why you want to leave 
 Baby, help me 
 Cause without you my whole world is falling apart

 (Oh girl) I need you come back home (you know I need you) I don't want to be alone 
 (Please stay don't go) Give me another chance I want to be your man

 Crying, begging, pleading 
 I'll do anything for your love 
 Would you help me? 
 Tell me what you want from me 
 Can you help me? 
 I don't understand 
 Girl I just a man 
 Help me

 Without you my whole world is falling apart 
 And without you girl I'm going crazy 
 Life's a prison without your love 
 Can you help me? 
 Tell me why, why, why, why, why, why 
 Can you help me? 
 Girl, I'll never stop because you're all I got 
 Can you help me? 
 Help me understand why I can't be your man

 How do I say? 
 A foreign beauty, so exotic 
 When she smiled at me 
 She took my breath away 
 She's reminiscent of a goddess 
 It's a shame that we could not communicate 
 How do I say... 
 How do I say hello? 
 I just wanna talk to you 
 How do I say you're beautiful 
 When I can't take my eyes off you? 
 I don't wanna say the wrong thing 
 I wanna use the right words to impress you 
 My baby, how do I say, how do I say? 
 How do I say? 
 The room was filled with her sweet aroma 
 When she danced her hips moved oh so sensuous 
 She speaks with her body, so hypnotic 
 In the language that I never will forget 
 I hear her calling 
 Spinning around in the crowd till she found me 
 Then she started moving closer and closer 
 Does she know that I want her, I want her 
 I wanna be with her tonight 
 So I caressed her face, kissed her lips 
 All my life I've never felt quite like this 
 I've never had a loss for words 
 One kiss from her has got me speechless 
 How do I say hello?

 In the body language we speak won't need any translation 
 An odyssey of physical pleasure 
 As we explore, together this universal language 
 Of love (love, my love, my love, my love, etc.) 
 Can you tell me how do I put it into words? 
 How do I say hello? 
 I just wanna talk to you

46,Usher,pop,Hottest Thing,"I've been looking at u, Turning brothers down, Song after song 
 Well it's time for me to holla now (your body is calling don't fight it) 
 Ooh I like it, You're dancing alone, What's that all about? 
 You're oh so fine 
 But its time for me to call you out (Watch how I straight run up on ya) 
 Girl I want ya 
 Ooh you're the hottest thing, in the club tonight 
 (Having) visions of making love tonight 
 With you constantly to the break of dawn 
 We can shake the spot if you say it's on. 
 Dancing so close got me up like Whoa 
 We're doing the most 
 Is leaving with you possible (Your body is saying you want to) 
 And I want you, oh Baby more than you know suge 
 If only for one night, I'll make you feel like you've been to paradise 
 (It's all up to you, tell me something baby, I know one thing) 
 Baby tell me (what's on your mind) 
 Do you think that I'm being too forward? 
 Ooh baby by coming at you, Coming at you this way 
 I can't help myself"
47,Usher,pop,Good Ol' Ghetto,"Yeah let me holla at you real quick

 Ya feel me? 
 Some of that... 
 Good ol, good ol, good old ghetto, good ol 
 Good ol, good ol ghetto 
 Good ol, good ol ghetto, ghetto, ghetto 
 Good ol... heh 
 I told my man I'm having a barbecue 
 So grab some folks and won't you slide right through 
 He brought this shorty that I used to know 
 It brought me back to when I was in school 
 She said Usher where have you been? 
 We used to kick it every now and then 
 Remember when I used to call your phone 
 Tell you come on cause my mother's gone 
 How about them times I had to throw 
 A rock at your window 
 To let you know to come downstairs 
 And open the door 
 And after that baby it was on fa'sure 
 Honey got my head spinnin' around for real 
 'Cause I'm thinking 'bout how good you used to feel 
 And I got a girl now and I don't get down like this, huh 
 But I must admit I'm tempted and startin' to reminisce, cause 
 Ay yo, ay yo, ay yo 
 Ain't nothing like some good ol' ghetto 
 Ay yo, ay yo, ay yo 
 Ain't nothing like some good ol' ghetto 
 Ay yo, ay yo, ay yo 
 Ain't nothing like some good ol' ghetto 
 Ay yo, ay yo, ay yo 
 Ain't nothing like some good ol' ghetto 
 Now she's asking me to take her 
 On a tour of my house so we can catch up 
 For all the time lost since I blew up 
 And became the man that drops his pants 
 And every girl around the world is dying to love 
 Break the beat down 
 Let me tell you what I'm talking about 
 If you're not careful it'll turn you out 
 It's that way she used to go 
 When you want it nice and slow 
 Even though you can't 
 The memory will make you want some mo' 
 She used to understand me 
 Touch me, hold me, taught me how to be a man 
 She used to kiss me all them things she used to show me 
 Damn I wish that I could do it again 
 Honey got my head spinnin' around for real 
 'Cause I'm thinking 'bout how good you used to feel 
 But I got a girl now and yo she's right upstairs 
 But I must admit I'm tempted and startin' to not care, cause... 
 Ay yo, ay yo, ay yo 
 Ain't nothing like some good ol' ghetto 
 Ay yo, ay yo, ay yo 
 Ain't nothing like some good ol' ghetto 
 Ay yo, ay yo, ay yo 
 Ain't nothing like some good ol' ghetto 
 Ay yo, ay yo, ay yo 
 Ain't nothing like some good ol' ghetto 
 Never had somebody that's as bad 
 Somebody with a whole lot of body 
 That'll choose, make you wanna leave the one you with 
 Cause you know how good it is 
 Not a prissy, lil' missy baby, talk that slang 
 I used to love how she kissed me when she popped that thang 
 She was a friend of the fam 
 Hot without the glam, not 
 When I be trippin' 
 She didn't really give a damn, stop 
 It's what I need to do 
 'Cause I know what's this is leading to 
 If I keep on thinkin' bout that back 
 I'mma be right back in it cause yo 
 Ay yo, ay yo, ay yo 
 Ain't nothing like some good ol' ghetto 
 Ay yo, ay yo, ay yo 
 Ain't nothing like some good ol' ghetto

 Is time for U-turn... U heard me 
 You're either with us or against us. Yo! 
 It's been some years now, 
 Since we hit the floor to get down. 
 We always had a step to go with the sound. 
 Now everybody wanna sit around drink and ball. 
 Remember the snake, 
 And how the floor used to clear, 
 Everybody would break. 
 What's krunk now, 
 Used to be called gettin' to it 
 I'm bringing it all back. 
 This is how we do it. 
 Just... 
 Chorus: (Repeat 2x) 
 Put your hands up, 
 Bend your knees. 
 Bounce around in a circle, 
 Get down wit me. OH! 
 Come on, come on, 
 It's not hard to learn. 
 Come on come on it's called the U-Turn. 
 In the 80's, fresh was the talk 
 MJ had everybody doin' the moonwalk. 
 In the 90's I had a high flat top. 
 Doin' the wop, 
 Pee- wee to the reebok 
 I can't forget about my high-school days, 
 The sound was Bobby Brown, 
 The dance was the running man. 
 Everybody wanna push Bently's. 
 The year is 2, 
 Everybody do the U- Turn. 
 All you need to do. 
 All you gotta do, 
 Is let the tempo take over you. 
 I came to have a good time. 
 Let the rhythm deep inside your soul, 
 Let it lead ya to the floor. 
 Oh come on...

50,Usher,pop,Separated,"If love was a bird then we wouldn't have our wings 
 If love was the sky we'd be blue 
 If love was a choir, U and I could never sing 
 'Cause love isn't for me and U 
 If love was an Oscar, U and I could never win 
 'Cause we could never act out our parts 
 If love is the bible, then we are lost in sin 
 Because it's not in our hearts 
 So why don't you go your way, 
 And I'll go mine 
 Live ur life 
 And I'll live mine 
 Baby, u'll do well 
 And I'll be fine 
 'Cause we're better off separated... 
 If love was a fire then we have lost the spark 
 Love never felt so cold 
 If love was a light then we're lost in the dark 
 Left with no one to hold 
 If love was a sport, we're not on the same team 
 U and I are destined to lose 
 If love was an ocean, baby, we are just a stream 
 'Cause love isn't for me and U 
 Girl, I know we had some good times 
 It's sad but now we gotta say goodbye 
 Girl you know I love U 
 I can't deny 
 Can't say we didn't try to make it work for you and I 
 I know it hurts so much 
 But it's best for us 
 Somewhere along this windy road, we lost the trust 
 So I walk away, so you don't have to see me cry 
 It's killing me so, why don't you go 
 (Out) 
 I'm sorry we didn't make it."
51,Usher,pop,U R The One,"U R The One 
 It was like 6 of us 
 3 in the Benz, 3 in the truck 
 On... 85 headed to the Plush 
 Ten minutes later when we pulled up 
 I parked the Benz, hit the alarm, glanced down at my rims 
 Tucked my pant leg in the tongue of my Tims 
 Hand in my shirt to reveal my gems 
 Proceeded to walk in 
 Just then I saw this 
 Magnificent misses, sippin' on a glass of Cris 
 With a couple of her friends gigglin' I knew... 
 U R the one 
 I don't give a damn 
 Even if ya got a man take my hand, girl 
 U R the one 
 Girl I know you'll understand 
 If you just give me a dance, take a chance, girl 
 Said, I know you got a few with u 
 Don't even trip I got my crew here too 
 Keep it real what you wanna do 
 I really wanna chill with u 
 Tell ya friends they can hop in the truck, we'll take the Benz 
 But if we split up maybe we can hook up again 
 U never know I guess that all depends 
 If I can get you from the floor to the door of my 6-0-0 
 2.0 momo's on low Pro's 
 So finish that Mo', get your coat 
 Tell ya girls c'mon let's go, 'cause

53,Usher,pop,U Remind Me (Remix),"Yo, I ain't seeing you in a minute, but I got something to tell ya, listen. 
 See the thing about you, that caught my eye, 
 Is the same thing that makes me change, my mind. 
 Kinda hard to explain, but girl, I'll try. 
 You need to sit down, this may take a while. 
 You see, she sorta looks, just like you. 
 She even smiles, just the way you do. 
 So innocent, she seemed, but I was schooled 
 I'm reminded when I look at you, but, 
 You remind of a girl, that I once knew. 
 See her face whenever I, I look at you. 
 You won't believe all of the things that she put me through. 
 This is why I just can't get with you. 
 Thought that she was the one for me, 
 Till I found out she was on her dream, 
 Oh, she was sexing everyone, but me. 
 This is why we could never be. 
 You remind of a girl, that I once knew. 
 See her face whenever I, I look at you. 
 You won't believe all of the things that she put me through. 
 This is why I just can't get with you. 
 I know it's so unfair to you, 
 But I'd be lingering the rest to you, 
 Wish I knew, wish I knew how to separate the two 
 You remind me, whoa 
 You remind of a girl, that I once knew. 
 See her face whenever I, I look at you. 
 You won't believe all of the things that she put me through. 
 This is why I just can't get with you. 
 You remind of a girl, that I once knew. 
 See her face whenever I, I look at you. 
 You won't believe all of the things that she put me through. 
 This is why I just can't get with you."

 What's crunk now used to be called getting to it 
 We're bringing it all back 
 This is how we do it, just 
 Put your hands up, bend your knees 
 Bounce around in a circle, get down with me 
 Oh come on, come on 
 It's not hard to learn 
 Come on, come on 
 It's called the you-Turn 
 Put your hands up, bend your knees 
 Bounce around in a circle, get down with me 
 Oh come on, come on 
 It's not hard to learn 
 Come on, come on 
 It's called the you-Turn 
 In the 80s, fresh was the talk 
 MJ had everybody doing the moonwalk 
 In the 90s, I had a high flat top 
 Doing the wop, Pee Wee to the Reebok 
 I can't forget about my high school days 
 The sound was Bobby Brown 
 The dance was the running man 
 Now everybody want to push Bentley's 
 The year is 2, everybody do the you-Turn 
 Put your hands up, bend your knees 
 Bounce around in a circle, get down with me 
 Oh come on, come on 
 It's not hard to learn 
 Come on, come on 
 It's called the you-Turn 
 Put your hands up, bend your knees 
 Bounce around in a circle, get down with me 
 Oh come on, come on 
 It's not hard to learn 
 Come on, come on 
 It's called the you-Turn 
 All you need to do is let go 
 Let the tempo take over you 
 I came to have a good time 
 Let the rhythm deep inside your soul 
 Let it lead you to the floor, whoa 
 Put your hands up, bend your knees 
 Bounce around in a circle, get down with me 
 Oh come on, come on 
 It's not hard to learn 
 Come on, come on 
 It's called the you-Turn"

 Forget about the game, I'm a spit the truth 
 I won't stop till I get 'em in they birthday suits 
 So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with they clothes 
 Then bend over to the front and touch your toes 
 I left the Jag and I took the Rolls 
 If they ain't cutting then I put 'em on foot patrol 
 How you like me now 
 When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand 
 Let's drink, you the one to please 
 Ludacris feel cups like double D's 
 Me and Ursh once more and we leaves 'em dead 
 We want a lady in the street but a freak in the bed to say

69,Usher,pop,Simple Things,"Yeah, uh 
 They say money can't buy you love 
 They say money can't buy you love 
 They never seem to listen 
 I'm all ears 
 Just copped your girl a brand new Rolex 
 But you can never find the time to spend at home 
 Thinkin' it's gon' keep her happy 
 When time is all she wanted all along 
 It's the simple things in life we forget 
 You hear her talkin' but don't hear what she said 
 Why do you make something so easy so complicated 
 Searching for what's right in front of your face 
 But you can't see it 
 So you think that you know what's important 
 Steady chasin' your fame and your fortune 
 But you don't know 
 You're chasing a dime losin' a treasure 
 Those dollars don't make sense to me at all 
 Ooh, it goes 
 Duh da duh da 
 You give her spending money 
 Duh da duh da 
 But all she wanna spend is time alone (tonight) 
 Keep givin' her 
 The finer things but 
 But she don't really need that 
 If you don't stop you're 
 You're gonna end up alone (alone) 
 The world without love (duh duh da duh da) 
 Why would you do it 
 It's the simple things in life we forget 
 You hear her talkin' but don't hear what she said 
 Why do you make something so easy so complicated 
 Searching for what's right in front of your face 
 But you can't see it 
 It's the simple things in life we forget 
 You hear her talkin' but don't hear what she said 
 Why do you make something so easy so complicated 
 Searching for what's right in front of your face 
 But you can't see it (listen) 
 Stop tryna buy her love 
 'Cause you won't ever have enough 
 There's always someone with more than you 
 You need to pay her attention 
 Give her what she needs 
 Do the simple things 
 Before you lose your girl to me 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 Yeah yeah 
 Play on playa 
 Yeah 
 Your girl comin' wit' me shorty, haha 
 I'm tellin' you man 
 'Cause you know 
 It's the simple things in life we forget 
 You hear her talkin' but don't hear what she said 
 Why do you make something so easy so complicated 
 Searching for what's right in front of your face 
 But you can't see it 
 You better look out 
 I hear you talkin', I hear you talkin' (ha) 
 But what are you saying 
 Oh hoo oh hoo 
 Don't be a fool 
 You got a good thing 
 Man are you blind 
 Stupid or crazy? 
 You got a good thing (uh) 
 You got a good thing 
 If that's your lady 
 You better hold on 
 And give her what she want 
 Before she move on 
 Man I tell you cars, clothes, and fancy things don't mean a damn thing 
 If you ain't kickin it baby 
 It's the simple things in life we forget 
 You hear her talkin' but don't hear what she said 
 Why do you make something so easy so complicated 
 Searching for what's right in front of your face 
 But you can't see it 
 (Fade) 
 Don't let this be the thing you'll always regret, no 
 It's right there, it's right there

 And hey, hey it's killing me on the inside 
 'Cause you're all I ever wanted so I can't deny 
 Somebody tell me, oh, is it that I'm so wrong, I can't say 
 Or is it my life, so young, careless ways

 I gotta be dreamin' 'cause I never felt like this before 
 It was supposed to be 
 Just a one night 
 In and out and I'm out the door 
 But she's got me sittin' here 
 At the red light 
 Drivin' round lookin' out for her 
 It was supposed to be 
 Just a one night 
 In and out and I'm out the door 
 So why am I sittin' here 
 At the red light 
 Drivin' round lookin' out for her 
 Lookin' out for her 
 Now its rainin 
 And I'm lookin' over at the passenger side 
 Thinkin' back in my mind how you set me off 
 She was stoppin' and droppin' me 
 Switchin from fast to slow 
 But that ain't have nothing on how you got 
 When I got you home 
 When you left (oh) 
 I'm thinkin' which way did she go 
 The way you touched yourself had me up the wall 
 I'm in the wind on cruise control

 Voluptuous, I love your confidence 
 You got it, you got it 
 Seduce me baby, seduce me 
 Just to get my attention 
 Sent a note and a drink 
 When we made our connection 
 She just nodded and winked 
 On this note it said 
 Its bout time we get together 
 Lets dance now, hook up later 
 We can do whatever 
 She had confidence 
 But it's all part of the game 
 'Cause to her, though I'm whipped, 
 Don't really mean a thing 
 She knew just what I liked 
 And now I'm thirsty for more 
 Seduction 
 Sensuous, sexy, erotic, 
 How you working your body 
 Ooh oh, you gon' make me do it,

 Baby wanna get down wit you 
 Down wit you, down with ya 
 You got my attention, 
 What you gon' do with it? 
 Baby turn around, stick it out, 
 I wanna see it 
 She make the first move, smooth, intoxicatin' 
 She plays me 
 I'm fightin' not to lose control 
 Now I'm feelin' a little tension 
 Don't know whos watchin 
 Getting big 
 In too deep, and I can't stop it 
 Your makin' it hard for me

 Baby whatever you want, girl you got it 
 I'll let ya satisfy 
 'Cause it's so hard to resist, oh your body 
 Got me on fire 
 Got vivid thoughts in my mind 
 Of positions that I'm gonna try 
 But is it worth all the hurt 
 Should I risk it just for one night 
 Once I give in, she's gonna win, 
 Either way I lose 
 But I gotta have you 
 I'm tryin' to chill, but she got me on the spot 
 She's so cocky, and the way she watchin me 
 Got me feelin' hot, uh 
 Shorty know that I got a girl 
 And I really can't break the rules, plus 
 Paparazzi snappin shots, 
 And its hard for me to shake these fools 
 So do I, one, put it on her, work my way to the front 
 Do I, two, play my part, and she will know not to pull no stunts, 
 Or maybe, three, chase the cat, 'cause she's sendin' me on the hunt 
 Nah, fuck that, I ain't no punk, imma give shorty what she wants 
 Seduction (oh you got me baby) 
 Sensuous, sexy, erotic, (gotta have you) 
 How you working your body

 Never find that one... 
 To make me feel Forever Young...

 Would be with you and no one else 
 If I had open arms... 
 Would you have a heart to spare? 
 If ever you want me near...

 Givin' you someone that understands 
 And a love that will never end 
 I can be all that you need and more... 
 It's time I know... I swear, never again... 
 See I think It's love, I've fallen in... 
 And I can't figure It out, the way 
 It's amazing how you surround me, 
 By the touch of your hand, If I could... 
 Everything I'd write, and the blue skies 
 Form me In your eyes to see... 
 Together you can me, Forever Young 
 But If I had one wish, my life to share 
 Would be with you and no one else 
 If I had open arms... 
 Would you have a heart to spare? 
 If ever you want me near... 
 I'll be glad to run and say I'm here 
 Someone that understands 
 And a love that would never end 
 I can be all that you need and more... 
 Can't keep running, 
 In the same direction 
 There's gotta be a better way 
 Together you and me will be... 
 Forever young...

 Would be with you, and no one else

 Used to jump up in the maybach and roll out 
 Used to care, she used to share 
 The love that she used to give me can't be found 
 I lost my way, she said she'd stay 
 And lately I've been sleeping with a ghost 
 My stock is down and out, I used to be worth my weight in gold 
 That was before a great depression kicked in and rocked us 
 And that was before the hurricane came in and stopped us 
 I told you to leave, but you lied to me 
 When you said that, ""baby no worries I promise to get us back"". 
 I know sorries, just wouldn't do it 
 Her heart is obliterated, I'm trying to travel through 
 But it's like moving mountains... 
 It's like moving mountains... hey.

 And the sky turns gray, and the water from the rain washes progress away.

 Just leave me be, ooh. 
 She, she don't touch me, I don't touch her 
 We rarely even ever say a word. 
 I really want to give her everything she deserves 
 But the bad took away the good. 
 She thinks that I'm full of it, arguments, always pissed, man I'm tired 
 Every kiss that I miss, girl you know I'm trying. 
 You never believe when I say, and I never believe it when you say 
 I love you, and I shouldn't complain about it 
 I should take it like a man and walk up out it

89,Usher,pop,Prayer For You (Interlude),"You gunna say something to the people 
 Prayer for you, a prayer to you 
 Do I sound that bad? 
 Just the simple thought of you means everything 
 To my life you give meaning, you're the best thing 
 So precious my gift for life 
 That's why I send you up this prayer 
 I pray for your protection, your covering 
 That everything intended for you, you'll receive 
 And I believe He'll guide you 
 Lord, honor my prayer 
 Prayer for you, a prayer to you 
 I pray for you, pray for you 
 I'll do my best to be there for you everyday 
 To be what my father wished he was to me 
 Baby, I got you 
 Daddy, you'll be there 
 I'll be there 
 To encourage you to be the best you can be 
 You carry my name, I pray that you're better than me 
 I ain't going nowhere 
 Even when I get on your nerves 
 'Cause I'm your daddy 
 My prayer for you 
 Son I pray for you"

 We both know that I been runnin' so long

 Hesitation aside 
 We're almost where we need to be

 Girl, you and me 
 Together, we'll take over the world 
 You know I love ya 
 I need you so 
 So happy I just wanna let everybody know 
 Think back to the time 
 When I was scared to let it show 
 Havin' too much fun with this and that one 
 Now that you're mine (huh yeah..) 
 Somewhere along the way, everything fell in place 
 Ooh... I'm so proud of how you represent me, baby 
 Whether rockin' Armani, Dolce Gabbana, Roberto Cavalli, Louis, or Gucci, girl 
 No matter what you wear, you do your own wit it 
 I'll feel the same years from here 
 But in the meantime, let me say what's on my mind 
 Ooh... listen 
 I think we've got somethin' special 
 Girl, you and me 
 Together, we'll take over the world 
 You know I love ya 
 I need you so

91,Usher,pop,Love You Gently,"First see the city skylights shining from my room 
 You're such a sight to see in the month of June 
 Beautiful like the moon's reflection when 
 It's passing off your skin and before you let me in 
 I hear you say 
 It's been a long time 
 I say okay, K, K, don't worry I got you 
 Do ya say? 
 How 'bout some foreplay? 
 Got that, got plenty, I got you 
 Do ya say? 
 Play some slow ones 
 Got that Sade, Al Green and Marvin Gaye too 
 To love you gently 
 Let me love you gently 
 Lay back relax, girl I?ma be 
 Light as a feather but hard as a rock 
 'Cause daddy know just what you like 
 Gonna love you gently 
 Light as feather but hard as a rock 
 See I know just when to finish 
 And I know just when to start 
 And I'll be lovin' your reaction 
 Every time I hit that spot 
 Gently 
 Bottom soft like leather 
 Gently 
 But the top is hard 
 Gently 
 Whisper your pleasures 
 Gently 
 Then I'll do my job 
 Invigorating, intense 
 Girl, let me do what I do 
 I don't know what's echoing louder 
 The music or you 
 Gently 
 I ain't close to be done yet 
 Gently 
 But your getting real warm 
 Gently 
 Like the calm of the thunder 
 Gently 
 Right after the storm 
 You say, you say, do you say it girl? 
 Make it 
 Gonna push it to the limit 
 It's yours, it's yours 
 See second place or win the race 
 I'm gonna be your number one 
 Till the sun shines 
 Here comes the sun forever more 
 Let's try and taste the moon again forever more 
 Let me touch you gently 
 That's the sound of love 
 Ripping shades off the wall 
 Light as a feather but hard as a rock 
 This might not be in the bedroom 
 But I'm gonna love you girl, gently 
 Light as a feather but hard as a rock 
 Let me touch you gently 
 Light as feather but hard as a rock 
 Gonna love you gently 
 Light as a feather but hard as a rock 
 Can you feel me girl? 
 We don't need no room 
 All we need is me and you 
 Wanna love you"

 Suprise you even took my call... 
 I just gotta few things I gotta, gotta discuss with you... would you mind if I ask you a question? 
 Listen, Is there any chance that you remember me being any more than just a horrible man... 
 And would you consider pullin this trigger and taking a second shot at romance 
 Oh Bbay

 But it wasn't until now I see how much I miss you... 
 Girl I'm sorry that I ran the streets acting like a damn fool... yeah 
 But for once, here goes the truth 
 I can't be fake I can't be phonie 
 Acting all hard that's the niggers that's lonely 
 I tried to flex but I confess that when you left you took the very best thing 
 The best things that ever happened to me 
 You took my best thing, 
 The best thing that I ever seen 
 You took the best thing that I ever seen 
 You took the... the best thing that I ever had 
 And now all I feel is stress 'cause when you left you took the very best

 I ain't got 'em no more, hey yes 
 Niomi or jenny - the same outcome is chillin'... 
 Girl, I let 'em all go... 
 No more trickin and kissin' miscelaenous chicks 
 Acting like a jerk, woman I been to church 
 And I talked to the bishop and he wanted me to share this with ya... 
 How much I miss you 
 I'm so sorry that I ran the stressts acting like a damn fool 
 But for once here goes the truth... 
 Can't be fake I can't be phonie

 The best things that ever happened to me

 You took the... the best thing that I ever had 
 And now I'm all out with this stress cause baby when you left you took the very best... 
 I couln't see how good it was until I could'nt see you no more 
 Why did I have to act like that 
 Damn right girl I want you back 
 Acting like a G, straight M-A-C and P-I-M-P 
 Got my arms empty 
 In the night time 
 And that's the right time 
 When I got time 
 Listen to what's on my mind 
 I can't be fake I can't be phonie 
 Acting all hard that's the niggers that's lonely 
 I tried to flex but I confess that when you left you took the very best thing 
 The best things that ever happened to me 
 You took my best thing, 
 The best thing that I ever seen

 But I do one every night and sometimes I had two 
 But all that has changed my game my frame of mind you got it right 
 And I love you life yo I love you for life 
 There was so many times I wasn't there for you 
 And for everyone of those times I hated myself for 
 The way I went about it the ups and the downs one foot in while the other foots out 
 Loving on you loving on another and I ain't no different from any of the brothers 
 What I did to you right here right now in this here place 
 In this here space as my heart pour out as I state my place as I break it down 
 To tell you where I'm coming from so you've seen the good you've done

94,Usher,pop,His Mistakes,"Do I remind you of the pain 
 That he put you through, girl

 Before I do it... 
 Is it because he, treated you badly 
 I always stand accused 
 Protecting yourself, from somebody else 
 I'm not who's hurting you girl 
 And it's killing me girl knowing you compare me to him 
 Always guilty before the sin 
 I can't win, I can't win no 
 I'll do anything to prove I love you 
 Baby girl but I refuse to 
 Pay for something I didn't do 
 I love you, girl 
 But I refuse to stay 
 Paying for his mistakes 
 He left a scar across your heart 
 I understand, girl 
 Don't let his wrongs tear us apart 
 Cause girl I'm your man 
 Just because he did 
 You swear I'm cheating 
 You think I just don't care 
 Why must I do time 
 For another man's crime 
 Girl you know that ain't fair 
 And it's killing me girl knowing, you compare me to him 
 Always guilty before the sin 
 I can't win, no I can't win 
 I'll do anything to prove I love you 
 Baby girl but I refuse to 
 Pay for something I didn't do 
 I love you, girl 
 But I refuse to stay 
 Paying for his mistakes 
 I know he did you wrong 
 But tell me what does that have to do with me 
 Trying to show you something real 
 Figure out what is going on 
 Before you look up and I'll be gone... 
 I'll do anything to prove I love you 
 Baby girl but I refuse 
 To pay for something I didn't do, girl 
 I love you, and I love you I love you 
 I'll do anything to prove I love you

 Wifey home, wedding band I'm a lucky man, 
 You'd think I'd be satisfied and truthfully yes I am, 
 But lately, only late at night I find it hard to sleep, 
 Stay struggling with the part of me that wants to run the streets, 
 My Mac is in my backpack, I'm surfing on the sites, 
 I'm chatting, this ain't cheating, jus telling myself a lie, 
 And it's almost like I'm caught up and living another life, 
 Man I'm hungry for something, I need to feed this appetite 
 Tempted I must confess, but I better not make a mess, 
 Better give my girl my vest cause my? under arrest, 
 'Cause I love my lady, 
 Fellas if ya love your girl fight that appetite for the ladies, appetite for the ladies, 
 Coulda picked up the phone, could of ended up doing wrong, 
 Man I miss home, but I ate my dinner at home, 'cause I love my lady, 
 Fellas if ya love your girl fight that appetite for the ladies, appetite for the ladies, 
 I'm not trying to be late, rush through security gates, 
 With weather in Atlanta, all out going flights delayed, 
 No rooms left in the Mender Inn, I gotta figure out a play, 
 Sparked up some conversation, she was going the same way, 
 We started talking business, she handed me a card, 
 We exchanged information, I rented me a car, 
 While I'm driving she calling, I'm thinking this is how it starts, 
 Fine as hell but I don't wanna break my baby's heart, no nonooo. 
 (Verse 3: Rapping) 
 They call me U.S.H.E.R R.A.Y.M.O.N.D, 
 And I just wanna do right by my lady, 
 But lately I been slippin up, fanasty bout dimes on the side, 
 Dark tint on my ride, I gotta 10 in ride, I can hide, 
 I can't lie lie, but ever since I put that band on my hand, 
 More and more chicks trying to get at me, 
 Then I don't know what to do, 
 Just trying to handle my grown man B.I, 
 Got a girl I don't want to lose, I don't want to lose, 
 Break her heart, I do want to do, I don't want to be that fool, 
 Make that move, 
 Bend them a bit, but never break the rules, bend a bit but never break the rules 
 She got the door locked, and the lock don't fit, your key, 
 Yah you punching up her numbers in the ADT, 
 You'll be wondering how the hell this happen to me, 
 Better not feed feed feed that appetite, 
 Now your baby's gone, you putting out? 
 And some other brother, been tossing up your? 
 Get caught slippin you gone wish you would of listen to meeee,

 But when I look in the mirror 
 It's the same old me 
 That my heart is in two different places

 And when we make love (Everytime you give, 
 Whoo, give to me your love) 
 Give... you make me feel a way I never felt with no 
 One else, and I can't help myself

 Cut me 
 Cut me with your tongue 
 Then love me when it's over 
 You don't even know just 
 How you much you taunt me 
 Taunting and provoking 
 Keep words unspoken 
 Pandora's box is open 
 Blame brings pain 
 Accusations seal 
 These walls 
 Walls built up 
 To shield from pain 
 Pain of finding fault 
 Revolving back to pain 
 And we need to stop 
 Just like a revolver, babe 
 Just like a revolver 
 (It goes around) 
 Just like a revolver, babe 
 But I'd rather resolve it, babe 
 Just like a revolver, babe 
 Just like a revolver 
 (It goes around) 
 Just like a revolver, babe 
 But we gotta resolve it babe 
 Piercing 
 Piercing with my actions 
 Spitefully ignore you 
 I don't even care 
 Just how much you take 
 Biten and it's potent 
 You hate it and I know it 
 Pandora's box is open 
 These walls get high baby [x3] 
 It won't ever come down 
 These walls get high baby [x3] 
 It won't ever come down 
 Round and round 
 Like the game roulette 
 Step on up kid 
 And place your bet 
 Round and round 
 Is the route we choose 
 Play that game, man 
 We all gonna lose"

 Got something that you need to know 
 You're the realest s*** I never wrote 
 Can't hold it, gotta let it go 
 Know, that I mean every note 
 Yeah, yeah, listen baby 
 Let me start by saying that the way I 
 Feel for you has never once changed 
 And the games I've played, mistakes I made 
 Leave me sorrier than you'll ever know 
 We got a problem, baby, I can't lie 'cause lately I realize 
 That I never knew that we was on the same playing field 
 Knew that it was wrong but we let it be 
 And I know you never knew when you said, ""I do"" 
 That you would have to face all the pain you feel 
 It's killing me, girl, that you have to live with this 
 Live with the lies I tell, live with the pain you feel 
 Knowing the man you love is fooling around 
 Oh, baby, said it's killing me, girl, said I just don't understand 
 Why you wanna be with this kind of man? Oh, ho 
 Why would you love a fool with all the things I do? 
 I know it's hard for you, hard for you to live with this 
 Trade memories for moments, trade love to be lonely 
 Guess it's just the man in me, blame it on celebrity 
 When the night time feel like the right time 
 And then spotlight feel like the bright light 
 But it's really just my fears and it still don't dry your tears 
 When I, say she ain't you and I really love you more 
 When you say if it's true why'd you do it for? 
 And I, I really don't have no excuse 
 I break your heart, make you cry, I just wanna say goodbye 
 And it's killing me, girl, that you have to live with this 
 Live with the lies I tell, live with the pain you feel 
 Knowing the man you love is fooling around 
 Oh, baby, said it's killing me, girl, said I just don't understand 
 Why you wanna be with this kind of man? Oh, ho 
 Why would you love a fool with all the things I do? 
 I know it's hard for you, hard for you to live with this 
 What I feel I don't even gotta write it, it's like poison in my body 
 And there's no way to deny that my heart is a time bomb 
 With seconds left to explode 
 But I gotta let you know before it blows 
 That it ain't on you, it's my fault 
 All the gossip and talk behind your back when you walk 
 By the time you will know, before long you will see 
 That you deserve more, you deserve more 
 You deserve so much more than what am, I will be 
 And it's killing me, girl, that you have to live with this 
 Live with the lies I tell, live with the pain you feel 
 Knowing the man you love is fooling around 
 Oh, baby, said it's killing me, girl and I just don't understand 
 Why you wanna be with this kind of man? Oh, ho 
 Why would you love a fool with all the things I do? 
 I know it's hard for you, hard for you to live with this 
 Live with this, can you live with this, girl? 
 I just want you to know 
 Got something that you need to know

 When she seen the green one she just go, go, go 
 Like a... in Bugatti, got money in your pocket 
 That makes you really pop, you really pop a body 
 Talk to the girl, talk to the one, oh 
 What will happen to you, what she gonna sound 
 Tell her to get up, tell her you hit the ground, oh, oh 
 Gonna face time, see if she's down 
 She says you most have money in your wallet so the thing don't fall 
 And this is credit cards... 
 Now you only know what you know 
 For real, she's a hot thing, 
 Hot thing, hot thing 
 Hot thing 
 What's her bootie? 
 Hot thing 
 What's her bootie? 
 Hot thing 
 What's her bootie? 
 She's young hot thing, baby lemme cool off 
 GQ status wouldn't fuck me with my suit off 
 She a fashion killer and you know I am a show hog Christin Louboutins red bottoms give me blue balls 
 She fuck me like she know me, 
 And fuck me like she owed me 
 She told me then she showed me, 
 Then she... like she lonely 
 All for the love, for the holly matrimony 
 But I'm pretty like Tony, and I'm pimping like... 
 Hi, hi how are you doing, I'm the... 
 ...'Cause we're running with the flame 
 She a hot girl, so she running with the name 
 Drop, drop it like it's hot, one more thing... 
 Go Nicki Minaj flow when I hit the... 
 If you let me menaj, I'll take you to sea ocean 
 Talk to the girl, talk to the one, oh 
 What will happen to you, what she gonna sound 
 Tell her to get up, tell her you hit the ground, oh, oh 
 Gonna face time, see if she's down 
 She said don't really... get me out of control 
 Baby, you stop this 
 It's my show! 
 Just take a little, I'm good to go 
 ... Hot thing, hot thing, hot thing 
 I like them girl with the bootilicious hot thing..."

 Were here now while the thunder is roaring 
 And the windows are blowing cause its pouring tonight 
 I put my hand on your chest 
 And its beating kinda fast so its mine 
 And this moment of silence you look me in the eyes 
 Nothings verbalized 
 I need you so much 
 The more I'm away from you 
 The more of you I want 
 (I need you) 
 Tell me that you wanna make love 
 Tell me that you wanna relieve love 
 Tell me that you wanna make love yeah 
 Baby I'm a man that believes in what it is 
 Were going to a whole 'nother level 
 When we do it it's so much more than sex tonight 
 When we're connected, every touch every kiss 
 We finally found what we been looking for in this bed 
 Its deeper than love 
 The more of you I have the more of you I want 
 I need you babe 
 (Tell me that you wanna make love) 
 Tell me that you wanna make love 
 Tell me that you wanna relieve love 
 Tell me that you wanna make love yeah 
 Baby I'm a man that believes in what it is 
 Hey hey 
 Oh baby can we go deeper deeper than the surface 
 Farther 
 I want to hold you 
 When you so wet and I'm so hard 
 And the two become one we work out our problems 
 We fix it, when we get body to body, body to body 
 Body to body 
 When you so wet and I'm so hard 
 And when the two become one it's like oh my god 
 And then we feel like our spirits want to leave our body 
 Leave our body, leave our body 
 When you so wet and I'm so hard 
 And the two become one we work out our problems 
 We fix it, when we get body to body, body to body 
 Body to body 
 When you so wet and I'm so hard 
 And when the two become one it's like oh my god

156,Usher,pop,Stronger,"Been through hell, now I'm helpful 
 Pouring cups of whiskey to get through it 
 Oh sweet child of mine, gone way too soon 
 Lost myself and lost my faith too 
 I've had my share of ups and downs 
 I've had my share of down and outs 
 Baptized in a river and almost drowned 
 That's when I figured out 
 I'm stronger than ever now, stronger than ever now 
 I'm stronger than ever now, stronger than ever now 
 Stronger than ever now 
 Oh 
 Walk through fire now I'm fireproof 
 Forever wear these scars like tattoos 
 Finally found paradise right in my view 
 And its killing me that I can't share it with you 
 I've had my share of ups and downs 
 I've had my share of down and outs 
 Baptized in a river and almost drowned 
 That's when I figured out 
 I'm stronger than ever now, stronger than ever now 
 I'm stronger than ever now, I'm stronger than ever now 
 (Stronger than ever now) 
 Though you're gone you still live in my mind 
 The only thing we ran out of is time 
 Since you left I ain't been quite the same 
 I wonder if you miss me, do I make you proud 
 Know you're watching me, I feel your spirit 
 I keep you right by my side 
 I'm stronger than ever now, far from perfect 
 Life will knock you down, get back up 
 Fight for what's worth it 
 Be strong enough, I know its easier said than done 
 Stronger than ever now 
 I been through it, now stronger 
 Stronger now, hey stronger now 
 All that I been through some how I found my way out 
 Long as I believe in me, I know I can make it 
 I know you'll make it, 'cause you're stronger 
 Stronger than ever now 
 Stronger"

 Be a good girl now, turn around, and get these whippings, 
 You know you like it like that,

164,Usher,pop,Be,"On the road to the riches, 
 Try and stop and take pictures 
 Pay attention to each detour and each sign along the way 
 Be aware of the winding roads 
 Know that as long as you take it slow 
 You'll be fine 
 Plus you'll find 
 You're already there 
 On the road to the riches, don't forget to stop to take pictures 
 Cause life ain't about where you finish, but what you've learned along the way 
 So as you chase success remember that I told you best 
 You look fine, then you'll find 
 You're already there 
 (And that's the truth) 
 Go ahead, be you (go 'head, be you) 
 If you want to be free (want to be free) 
 First you must be, 
 Just be, just be 
 With the glass half empty at least you know you're not thirsty 
 Try to see it for what it is 
 Really half full now take a sip 
 And as it trickles down let it wash away any doubts 
 In your mind 
 You'll find 
 Don't think real joy is in position or money (No) 
 Don't compare your life to somebody else that you don't know 
 Just what they're going through unless you walk a mile in their shoes 
 Don't be blind, the sun shines on everybody 
 (And that's the truth) 
 Go 'head be you 
 (Go 'head be you) 
 If you want to be free (want to be free) 
 Then you have to first be (be) 
 Just be (be) 
 I know that sometimes life can throw a curve 
 But you gotta keep on swinging hard 
 It's the only way to knock one out the park 
 And if it doesn't make it over the wall 
 The only way you strike-out is if you don't swing at all 
 (Mmm? And that's the truth) 
 Go ahead be you

 If you want to be free (want to be free) 
 Be (Be) 
 Just be (be)

 So let me kick it to yah (To yah!) 
 I don't have a lot of girls, 
 But I gotta know 
 I'll get the respect that I give 
 That's just the way I live 
 Because the last girl

 She tried to pull a fooler 
 And do you know 
 What had happened 
 Hook (twice)

 Just giving a little love 
 It's spreading everywhere

 I know my girl will always 
 Hit it 
 Pit it

 Cause it looks 
 Like numbness 
 My lovin' and 
 Hugin' 
 And bitterness 
 My peeps keep 
 Pumpin' 
 Humpin' 
 On stage 
 I'm engaged 
 And yes 
 The truth is it 
 U see an 
 Ugly woman

 Drug you out

 Ain't wanna come 
 That's why 
 Your standin there 
 Actin' stuck up 
 Holdin' up the wall

 A misconception of men 
 Thinkin' were 
 All the same 
 Full of games 
 All because you ended up 
 With the wrong one 
 I bet you think 
 That chivalry is gone 
 Guess you 
 Ain't seen nothing 
 Like it in so long 
 It's when you open 
 Her door or come? 
 You give her your coat 
 When it's cold outside

 [Verse One - Shyne] (J.D.) {*Shyne on the phone*} 
 Sittin' in my cell, had to buck to buck some 
 Would it be allowed if I didn't shoot first 
 Had it made, sorry for the ricochet 
 Would I be here today if I didn't let it spray 
 I never said that I was perfect 
 Nobody walkin' on this earth is 
 At night, I would've gotten murdered 
 If I ain't grab the hatchet and let them cowards have it

 It's ya boy on his way home man, the boy on his way home man)

 My chick on the side, said she got one on the way

 Man, how does she bring it up how does she break it down 
 Man you at the clinic, dawg slow down that's yo child 
 But if you keep it, then you gotta tell your girl you was cheatin' 
 And you went raw dog when you beat it 
 That's when she gon' tell you to beat it 
 You know it ain't y'all little secret 
 You famous you can't go nowhere 'cause every time you go there 
 There's hoes there so basiclly you and your girl over 
 I know when she broke the news you told her ""man don't say that"" 
 Matter fact like Pat don't say, that 
 Everytime a nigga sittin' on paychecks 
 Things come up from way way way back I confess

 I confess about the incident when I was with a shorty in the Lexus coupe 
 Ya homie said she saw me but she didn't have proof 
 But I knew I really should've just been tellin' you the truth 
 And I confess about the days I was rollin' my Seville with the custom gold grill 
 I was in the field still lookin' for a thrill 
 And I knew it was bogus I should've kept it real 
 And I confess that, just when I thought I could really try to get away 
 While havin' other women on the side 
 But I never knew that it would catch up wit' a nigga one day

 My chick on the side said she got one on the way 
 These are my confessions

 'Bout that chick on part 1, I told y'all I was creepin' with, sleepin' with 
 Said she's 3 months pregnant and she's keepin' it 
 The first thing that came to mind was you 
 Second thing was how do I know if it's mine and is it true 
 Third thing was me wishin' that I never did what I did 
 How I ain't ready for no kid and bye-bye to our relationship?

180,Usher,pop,Confessions Pt.1,"Everything that I been doing is all bad 
 I got a chick on the side with a crib and a ride 
 Been telling you so many lies, ain't none good, it's all bad 
 And I just wanna confess, it's been going on so long 
 Girl, I been doing you so wrong and I want you to know that 
 Everything that I been doing is all bad 
 I got a chick on the side with a crib and a ride 
 Been telling you so many lies, ain't none good, it's all bad 
 And I just wanna confess, it's been going on so long 
 Girl, I been doing you so wrong and I want you to know that 
 Every time I was in L.A., I was with my ex-girlfriend 
 Every time you called I told you, baby, I'm workin', no 
 I was out doin' my dirt, oh, wasn't thinkin' 'bout you gettin' hurt 
 I was hand in hand in the Beverly Center like man 
 Not givin' a damn who sees me 
 So gone, I know, so wrong, just listen 
 Acting like I didn't have you sittin' at home 
 Thinkin' about me, bein' a good girl that you are 
 Bet you probably believe, you got a good man 
 A man never would do the things, I'ma 'bout to tell you I've done 
 Brace yourself, it ain't good 
 But it would be even worse if you heard this from somebody else 
 Everything that I been doing is all bad 
 I got a chick on the side with a crib and a ride 
 Been telling you so many lies, ain't none good, it's all bad 
 And I just wanna confess, it's been going on so long

 And I just wanna confess, it's been going on so long 
 Girl, I been doing you so wrong and I want you to know that 
 If I could turn back the hands of time and start all over I would 
 Instead of everything being all bad, baby, everything would be all good 
 I don't wanna lose you but I know what I'm telling you 
 Ain't gon' make you wanna stay, you probably just wanna run away 
 Or mad enough to punch me in my face 
 Been living like an idiot and deserve every bit of it, I know 
 Today is the day that I ain't gon' lie in the plan 
 And the bullshit, girl, I'm sorry, baby, I'm sorry 
 But I can no longer run around with this stress on my chest 
 I confess 
 Everything that I been doing is all bad 
 I got a chick on the side with a crib and a ride 
 Been telling you so many lies, ain't none good, it's all bad 
 And I just wanna confess, it's been going on so long 
 Girl, I been doing you so wrong and I want you to know that 
 Everything that I been doing is all bad 
 I got a chick on the side with a crib and a ride 
 Been telling you so many lies, ain't none good, it's all bad 
 And I just wanna confess, it's been going on so long 
 Girl, I been doing you so wrong and I want you to know that 
 Can you break it down, don't leave me, baby 
 Everything that I been doing is all bad 
 I got a chick on the side with a crib and a ride 
 Been telling you so many lies, ain't none good, it's all bad 
 And I just wanna confess, it's been going on so long

 And though we in love she ain't all luvy-duvy 
 Smacks me on the ass and says fast nigga fuck me 
 Don't worry if my babygirl trust me 
 I don't do nothing for her to bust me 
 I would love her if her rings were rusty 
 Feet were crusty 
 And arms were musty 
 Cause ain't nobody gettin' that--just me 
 And ain't nobody hittin that--just me 
 If I cheat I know that she will bust me, crush me 
 'Cause she know how many girls lust me

 Now they say they don't want nobody but me

 Brownskin dove 
 But her love won't pass you 
 Promised her a ring 
 Along with a shine 
 Never stressin my rhyme 
 All she wanted is time 
 Where she find me at 
 'Cause I'm a grimy cat 
 Puffin dime sacks to see where my mind be at 
 And you know the game a nigga got, I told her yo 
 I don't always have to hit the twat, ust to get you hot 
 You don't believe me 
 Then pick a spot 
 But remember, I lick alot 
 Ayyo she likes to trick alot 
 'Cause she got a bigga knot 
 Loves to see her nigga hot 
 Worries if I'm jigged or not 
 And her stuff--hot and divine 
 And the things she coppes--top of the line 
 Baby is hot and divine 
 Always poppin' some wine 
 And then she told me 
 Cam, I got a rock on my mind 
 (Chorus-2x's)

 It feels good when you love em' 
 And they lovin' you back 
 Go tit for tat 
 Never scratch your back 
 Matter of fact she touches and grabs 
 Not to lust you bad 
 Just to get you mad 
 When we alone she screams and moans 
 She don't front on me 
 'Cause she don't want to be alone 
 Come on 
 Everybody needs somebody 
 Spanish girls screamin out 
 Ay Papi! 
 Take her out 
 Uh-huh no doubt 
 Then we lace her out 
 Uh-huh no doubt 
 Then we ski her out 
 (Usher) 
 Ski her out 
 (Cam) 
 Then we eat her out 
 (Usher) 
 Eat her out

 Come on, where your man at?

 Where your tan at?

 On a cloudy afternoon

 Built upon a sandy beach 
 Gone Too Soon 
 Like a bird flock

 To aspire, DELIGHT in one day

 Living the life I live 
 I had to grow up quik so I 
 Became my man instantly 
 Accepted the responsibilities 
 Even ma name in lights 
 Curtain goes up and I know all eyes are on me 
 And the world dnt stop 
 When I get home 
 I gotta satisfy her needs and it's so heavy 
 Feels like the weight of the worlds on ma shoulda 
 Sometimes I wanna run away but it's so heavy 
 Everyday it gets harder the pressure 
 But I gotta do what I gotta do baby 
 What should I say to her 
 When I know she's hurt 
 But I was raised to be a man to find 
 Do everything I can to survive 
 But I hate that I miss christmas (with my family) 
 Wasnt there for a valentines kiss (for my baby) 
 But I can't replace lost tyme 
 No but can't you see baby I'm trying 
 But its heavy 
 Feels like the weight of the worlds on ma shoulda 
 Sometimes I wanna run away but it's so heavy 
 Everyday it gets harder the pressure

 He complains about his 6-figure salary, tax to feed the poor 
 He doesn't understand the homeless, doesn't think its genocide

 He does shit to make it better

 Long as you coming home, girl, I don't mind 
 I'm just tryna cut her up, tryna bust a nut 
 Tryna take somebody bitch, turn her to a slut 
 Tryna fill my cup, tryna live it up 
 Throw some hundreds on that ass, walk her out the club 
 (Yeah, ho) Lap dance for the first date 
 Bet I threw a few bands, that's third base 
 It's okay if you work late, we can still party like it's your birthday 
 We can still party hard in your birthday suit 
 Knock that pussy out the park like my name Babe Ruth 
 Shawty she just want a tip, I just want to see her strip 
 If you fuck me like you love me Shawty you might get rich 
 Have her own cake, her own place, blow her own gas, no role' 
 When we in the bed she like to roleplay, tell her friend to join in both ways 
 Shawty, I don't mind If you dance on a pole 
 That don't make you a ho 
 Shawty, I don't mind when you work until three 
 If you're leaving with me 
 Go make that money, money, money 
 Your money, money, money 
 'Cause I know how it is, go and handle your biz 
 And get that money, money, money 
 Your money, money, money 
 You can take off your clothes 
 Long as you coming home, girl, I don't mind"
208,Usher,pop,I Heard A Rumour,"I heard a rumor 
 That your girl wants me 
 I heard a rumor 
 Oh my Lord 
 Hey 
 That your girl wants me 
 Homie 
 She's tryna tell you 
 Yeah yeah 
 (The girl wants me) 
 Ooh 
 She's tryna tell you 
 Oh no 
 (The girl wants me) 
 Now listen (hey hey) 
 You've been my boy and 
 Wont knock you for it 
 From way back from around the way 
 Time has been going 
 And I've been ignoring 
 Your girl and what she has to say 
 And my nigga 
 Homie 
 She's tryna tell you 
 Yeah yeah 
 (The girl wants me) 
 All the time 
 She says be cool and you'll be calm but 
 No I say that's not the way to go 
 And many men would fight you 
 But I decided to invite you 
 And talk about this man to man 
 We're men (right) 
 If you do not want her 
 Why adjutate and taunt her 
 Hey just give her to your best friend 
 (That's when they talk man) 
 See the moral of this story is 
 Form a friend who'll ignore the kiss 
 You could turn to glorious just try 
 I consider you as more than a friend 
 I hope you can accept this 
 But the test is after we say goodbye 
 (1) 
 Baby I just spoked to him 
 Like you wanted me to 
 But you gotta promise to speak to him 
 And get his blessings too 
 Homie 
 She's tryna tell you 
 Yeah yeah 
 (The girl wants me) 
 Ooh 
 She's tryna tell you 
 Oh no

 When I can't sleep, sleep at all. 
 Oh slowly, I close my eyes. 
 My thoughts they fly away to you no matter what I do. 
 And I wish, I could turn back time, 
 Back to the time when you were mine. 
 I wish, I wish the day, the day you went away, 
 Never happened a-baby 
 I wish the stars, the stars in the heaven would come down to me, 
 So I could give them to you and tell me then would you be loving 
 Me, like I wish 
 And it's so hard, when you love someone this much, 
 But you just don't know how, how to love him the right way 
 If you could see, what you've done to me, 
 What you've done to my heart, what you've done to my soul baby 
 All of my mind and all of my body, then you should have known 
 Why I can't let it go and baby I, 
 I wish the day, the day you went away never happened a-baby, 
 I wish the stars, the stars in the heaven, would come down to me 
 So I could give them to u, and tell me then would you be, loving me 
 Like I wish 
 I don't know what you want me to do, 
 To prove me love is a-real for a-you, 
 I don't know what you want me to say baby, 
 There is no ifs or maybes, 
 All I want is you, 'cause baby you are my only wish 
 Ooh my only wish"

 Think I need a little help 
 Let's go 
 When this began, we were friends 
 She knew all my business (business) 
 All my good, all my bad 
 Said that she was with it (now) 
 I got memories, this is crazy 
 She ain't nothing like that girl I used to know 
 Didn't believe she would creep 
 Thought we was forever (oh) 
 She broke out, I broke down 
 And that's just all that left of us (oh) 
 Now these memories, they be haunting me 
 You ain't feeling me 
 My girl's about to go 
 And I really wanna work this out 
 'Cause I'm tired of fighting (if that don't work) & 
 I really hope she still want me the way I want her (you'll get your feelings hurt) 
 I said I really wanna work this out 
 Damn girl I'm trying 
 Here's the remix (remix) 
 I got this ice box where my heart used to be [2x] but (said)

 You got memories (but) 
 Take it from me (cause) 
 She ain't nothing like oh girl you used to know 
 If shawty's doing right by you 
 Maybe you should let it go 
 At the end of the day, 
 It ain't worth it 
 Wanna know how I know (how you know) 
 Remember confessions 
 So you already know that it's gonna hurt 
 Shawty, learn your lesson 
 You don't really wanna feel the burn 
 No, listen 
 If you really wanna work it out 
 Then stop denying (denying) 
 Quit living in the past of time 
 You face the truth (truth) 
 If it's ever gonna work out 
 You gotta stop lying 
 Stop blaming her when it's you, that's 
 Got the ice box where your heart used to be 
 Got a ice box where your heart used to be

 I'm so cold I'm so cold I'm so cold I'm so cold (oh) 
 I'm so cold I'm so cold I'm so cold

 You know everybody is always talking about change 
 Now don't get me wrong 
 Change can be beautiful 
 Something is just still the same you know 
 If this were our last night 
 Here on this planet 
 How would you feel 
 What would you say 
 Pretend that you never 
 Ever will see me 
 After tonight, after today 
 And I tell me you rather fight 
 And hold the grudge against me 
 Instead of makin' love tonight 
 Ooh is that what you sayin' baby 
 I never be flawless 
 Never be perfect 
 No matter how bad you want me to be 
 I'll be your hero 
 As soon as you let go 
 And stop having me in your fantasy 
 Lets just live life 
 Lets just have fun 
 Maybe inside we can be as one 
 But if we never do then that's okay 
 All that I'm trying to say is 
 I ain't gonna change (oh no) 
 Just beein someone else is too damn hard 
 And I don't want you to change (oh no)

 And ooh, I never wanted anything more 
 And I didn't understand before - but now I do 
 All that I ask is, just be you 
 Now what if tomorrow came and I change 
 And you started doing things that you claim 
 Would be better, what if I did whatever 
 To push the ease that we'd always be together 
 Would that make you satisfied 
 To have me home every night 
 No way that I really missed the lights 
 Could you live with yourself 
 If that'd happen babe 
 Tell me where is the girl 
 The one who used to standin 
 As the light in my world 
 Where is she at 
 'Cause I want her back 
 Can we go back 
 Cause who I'm looking at 
 Forgot how to love 
 I want the one that gave me love 
 The one that I could go to 
 Who used to trip on all the little things 
 Baby I'm just sayin' 
 That change ain't alway happy goes

 I care 
 And I don't want nobody but you

 In the way I know 
 I never let you go

 That we were fighting 
 Tell me where it's gone

 Any problems that we had, we always worked it together 
 Did I say or is this something I've done wrong 
 Maybe I should know, but I don't 
 Still I wanna make it better 
 If something hurting you then girl let me know 
 If it's me than baby tell me 
 You don't have to ignore 
 You don't want this anymore 
 Just don't let me be the last to know 
 Honestly you got me torn (and I'm so confused) 
 Cause now a days you got a new attitude 
 And you, barely answer my calls (but when I finally get through) 
 You rush of the line, like I don't matter to you 
 Was there something I said, girl what did I do? (What have I done?) 
 If there's a problem it ain't hard for us to work it out. 
 Together, no different from what we've been through before. 
 I can't move on, and I won?t, until we make it better. 
 If something hurting you then girl let me know 
 If it's me then baby tell me 
 You don't have to ignore 
 You don't want this anymore 
 Just don't let me be the last to know 
 I never believe we go this far 
 Don't you let people tear what we have apart? 
 So girl don't do it 
 If something hurting you then girl let me know

 Spit that mack-a-docious 
 Most ferocious 
 Cash all in my holsters 
 Burn more bread than toasters

 'Cause I get money and run with the richest men 
 Knockin' at ya door it's Curry again 
 Been down since the jump off begin 
 You know who I am 
 Don't get it all twisted up 
 Get the cash to my hands be all blistered up 
 We can pick it up, we can drop it low 
 Recognize what it is when I come through the door 
 Not partyin' and pimpin', I walk wit a limp 
 Once I took it to the top I ain't fell off since 
 Stay high stay fly stay cool in the fan

 She's making her way to my area 
 And when she gets past security,

 And this is what she wants! 
 Straight off the concorde, to cheers and encore 
 Nice sweats, she phenes for one boy 
 The innovator, 
 Young sean combs 
 Remenising me and biggie bringing boys home 
 Father figure, hatings for them other niggaz 
 Dirty money went and brought a money printer 
 Now my money longer on the Mississippi river 
 Money making extraordinary!

 Girl if you just give me a little bit...

 Hope that 'cha fine, wanna know what you got in mind tonight, 
 Got me feenin' like Jodeci, girl, I can't leave you alone,

 V.I.P. done got way too crowded, 
 I'm about to end up callin' it a night, 
 You should holla at 'cha girl, tell her you shakin' the scene, 
 Pull off, beep-beep, shotgun in a GT with me 
 She said, ""Oh-oh, I'm ready to ride, yeah,"" 
 ""'Cause once you get inside, you can't change your mind,"" 
 ""Don't mean to sound impatient, but you gotta promise, baby, oh...""

 (2nd Verse - Ludacris) 
 Look here! 
 Sometime I wanna be your lover, 
 Sometime I wanna be your friend, 
 Sometime I wanna hug ya, 
 Hold hands, slow-dance while the record spins, 
 Opened up your heart 'cause you said I made you feel so comfortable, 
 Used to play back then, now you all grown-up like Rudy Huxtable, 
 I could be your bud, you could beat me up, 
 Play-fight in the dark, then we both make love, 
 I'd do anything just to feel your butt, 
 Why you got me so messed up? 
 I don't know, but you gotta stop trippin', 
 Be a good girl now, turn around, and get these whippings, 
 You know you like it like that, 
 You don't have to fight back, 
 Here's a pillow - bite... that, 
 And I'll be settin' separate plays, 
 So on all these separate days, 
 Your legs can go they separate... ways...

 All the wrong I did before 
 I wish that our love could stay the same 
 Why'd you give me no chances...

 And what I do is the major league

 A lotta dirt slung up when she hung up 
 I could tell somethin' in her voice wasn't right 
 Booked at [? ] at last minute, 4am and she ain't home 
 Start dialin' up her digits, she ain't answerin' the phone 
 See headlights in my blinds, I'm losin' my mind 
 6:45 in the mornin', what's goin' on 
 Don't come up in here lyin' 
 She said, ""Sit down, now baby, we need to talk"" 
 She told me there was somebody else 
 And I had it coming 
 It was that room in Cancun 
 That stack of chips in Vegas 
 That college dorm in Georgia 
 That'll forever remain nameless 
 I know I got no right to judge you but it really hurts 
 And knowin' I deserve it makes it worst 
 Can't count the times I did you wrong on one hand 
 Can't count the times I made you cry on one hand 
 I know I told one too many lies 
 Never thought it'd turn around on me 
 Let's call it even and I won't up and leave 
 I can count the times you did me wrong on one hand 
 I can count the times you made me cry on one hand 
 Every man you ever gave your love on one hand 
 Oh no, on one hand (On one hand) 
 Breathin' heavy, heartbeat thumpin' so fast 
 I gotta know right now, put it all out on the table 
 Brace myself before I ask 
 I'm a need places, names, and numbers 
 Scratch that- tell me where he stay 
 For the [? ] said be careful where you lay 
 Man, I thought you let him go 
 You best let me know 
 How many days, how many ways did he hit that 
 Did he make my queen his hoe?

 Try to forgive and forget 
 But if I do, I know I look like a fool 
 I did my dirt, and I made you hurt 
 How the hell you turn it around and switch on me 
 (Switch it on me) 
 Go with the first in mind, and kick it 
 I can't guarantee it won't happen again 
 I can't let it go, but if I do 
 For this day forward, we gotta promise to keep it on 
 No, baby

 But I got to say 
 Imagine the city under the stars 
 ... 
 I can tell you want me 
 So I might save you for the night 
 I'm an amazing, courageous, fantastic, awesome guy 
 And if you can keep me in your eyesight 
 Just for the moment 
 We can call it a night 
 You might be in my radar 
 You could get up in my radar 
 You might be in my radar 
 ..."
248,Usher,pop,Rap 2K1,"Last month I spent two weeks on a vacation 
 I had a dream that I was inside of my PlayStation 
 Did you ever lay down, take a nap and loose it? 
 I dreamt I was stuck in this game called Rap Music 
 I started off underground in a dark room 
 With a freestyle, a sawed-off pump and a harpoon 
 That transform to a pen in case of a words war 
 And opened the first door that led to the first floor 
 I got attacked by a couple of rap acts 
 They wore dreads, these army pants and these backpacks 
 I hit one over the head with a broken verb 
 The muthafucka tried to hit me with some spoken word 
 But it didn't work, and I finished him and his boys 
 And disappeared from the scene without makin' a noise 
 I used up four bars but I earned a punchline 
 And proceeded to Level 2: Land of the Unsigned 
 We don't play those games 
 Would you listen here? 
 What I'm doin' he're? 
 Get me outta here 
 We don't play those games 
 This is gettin' wild 
 Can you tell me how? 
 Let me out now 
 We don't play those games 
 How'd I get in here? 
 Let me outta here 
 What I'm doin' here? 
 We don't play those games 
 This is no fun 
 Got me on the run 
 Rap 2K1 
 I got attacked right away when I walked in 
 By a four-foot manager with a contract and a pen 
 I put up my force shield to block any attempt 
 At this shrimp drainin' my life twenty percent 
 The floor opened up and I almost fell inside 
 But I used my mic right, I swung to the other side 
 And just when I thought I avoided the booby trap 
 I got slapped by a female MC with a doobie rag 
 And this chick was tryin' to be herd like she raised cattle 
 But I remembered somethin' I seen on the Blaze Battle 
 Whoever sold you them shoes, they fooled you 
 I killed her with a verse about her fucked up weave and her fake FUBU 
 A record exec then appeared in a black limo 
 And started to attack with a bag full of wack demos 
 And I will admit: it was hard as hell to kill 
 So I stabbed him with an invoice and a studio bill 
 I made it to the next level: Above Ground 
 My soundscanner then picks up on this bug sound 
 I pull out the sawed-off pump and I get it cocked 
 And that's when this A&R crawled from under a rock 
 And start shootin' opinions, I stop, drop and I roll 
 'Cause if they was to hit me, they'd penetrate to my soul 
 I hid behind some trees and I held my weapon tightly 
 His street team was up on the roof tryin' to snipe me 
 It took a while to finish 'em all but I finally did it 
 Then out comes this powerful beast known as the critic 
 With a fully loaded magazine and mad drama 
 My harpoon shots just bounced off of his armor 
 Now I wish I would've stayed down in the dark caves 
 I'm runnin' towards these big-ass fans with these sharp blades 
 But he was right behind me holdin' a flame thrower 
 So I jumped through the blades and I died, game over"

 Wotz up now wotz up now 
 Wotz up now wotz up now 
 Lets go 
 When you let me 
 Have my way and I was thinkin' I could get it again 
 Baby we could be friends if your lonely (all alone, ssh) 
 And you show me 
 Just how quick your tires could spin 
 You were off in the wind 
 Tell me were did you go 
 When you left (oh) 
 I'm thinkin' which way did she go 
 I should have known that you lead me on girl 
 I'm in the wind on cruise control 
 I gotta be dreamin' 'cause I never felt like this before 
 It was supposed to be 
 Just the one night 
 In and out and I'm out the door 
 But she's got me sittin' here 
 At the red light 
 Drivin' round lookin' out for her 
 It was supposed to be 
 Just a one night 
 In and out and I'm out the door 
 So why am I sittin' here 
 At the red light (lookin' crazy) 
 Drivin' round lookin' out for her 
 Lookin' out for her 
 Now its rainin 
 And I'm lookin' over at the passenger side 
 Thinkin' back in my mind how you set me off 
 She was stoppin' and droppin' it 
 Switchin from fast to slow 
 But that ain't have nothing on how you got 
 When I got you home 
 When you left (oh) 
 I'm thinkin' which way did she go 
 The way you touched yourself 
 Had me up the wall 
 I'm in the wind on cruise control 
 I'm searchin for you 'cause I can't seem to let you go 
 It was supposed to be 
 Just a one night 
 In and out and I'm out the door 
 But she's got me sittin' here 
 At the red light 
 Drivin' round lookin' out for her 
 It was supposed to be 
 Just a one night 
 In and out and I'm out the door 
 So why am I sittin' here 
 At the red light 
 Drivin' round lookin' out for her 
 Lookin' out for her 
 (Ludacris) 
 Uh yeah uh 
 She had a coke bottle shape 
 Pretty big booty, small waist 
 Now I feel a little woozy 
 'Cause I really wanna see her face once more 
 Now this woman got me messed up in my head 
 I forgot about my thoughts and what I said 
 All I can remember is one night more than one hour on one floor 
 Oh and there was one red light by the bed 
 That was glowing off her skin when I did my thing 
 We was drippin with a little bit of sweat and a whole lot of lust 
 'Cause I must of really digged her friend 
 And all I wanna say is that we handle doors 
 There ain't to many women that can handle stars 
 And what I wouldn't give just one more time 
 For the chance to grip them handle bars 
 It was supposed to be 
 Just a one night 
 In and out and I'm out the door 
 But she's got me sittin' here 
 At the red light 
 Drivin' round lookin' out for her 
 It was supposed to be 
 Just a one night 
 In and out and I'm out the door 
 So why am I sittin' here 
 At the red light 
 Drivin' round lookin' out for her 
 Lookin' out for her 
 It was supposed to be 
 Just a one night 
 In and out and I'm out the door

 I know your weakness 
 You can't look me straight in the eye and tell me that 
 You're okay and nothing's bad, what's going on in your head? 
 You can't deny it - ooh but you're lying 
 How come you're so wrapped up in that anger, let me get you out 
 You say that nothing can help your situation that I could do, you doubt 
 How can you be so quick to judge what you can't even see? I mean really 
 I'm not just something you have from your past, don't blame it all on me 
 Tell me, let me get ready for the letdown, but I'm not giving up now 
 'Cause the secrets that you're keeping 
 I know your weakness 
 You can't look me straight in the eye and tell me that 
 You're okay and nothing's bad, what's going on in your head? 
 You can't deny it ? girl, but you're lying 
 What's the problem, something's got you bent out of shape 
 'Cause I can see that you're hurting, it's written all over your face 
 I told you my only objective is to make you smile (ah baby) 
 But you keep saying I'm interrupting, in the meantime give it a little bit of loving 
 I'm going to get to the bottom of it 
 'Cause the secrets that you're keeping 
 I know your weakness 
 You can't look me straight in the eye and tell me that 
 You're okay and nothing's bad, what's going on in your head? 
 You can't deny it - ooh but you're lying 
 I know you told me that you had enough 
 And the pain will go away if you feel enough 
 The only way to make it through another day 
 Is to keep fighting, keep fighting, keep fighting, keep fighting 
 And when you feel like giving up 
 And you'll keep searching till you find (out) just what to do 
 You have a right to open up 
 Baby, there's no way to hide it 
 Eventually the truth will come out of you 
 'Cause the secrets that you're keeping 
 I know your weakness 
 You can't look me straight in the eye and tell me that 
 You're okay and nothing's bad, what's going on in your head? 
 You can't deny it ? girl, but you're lying

 Got me fiendin' like Jodeci, girl, I can't leave you alone, 
 Take a shot of this here Petrone' and it's gon' be on, 
 V.I.P. done got way too crowded, 
 I'm about to end up callin' it a night, 
 You should holla at 'cha girl, tell her you shake it and seized, 
 Pull off, beep-beep, shotgun in the GT with me 
 She said, ""Oh-oh, I'm ready to ride, yeah,""

 (2nd Verse - Ludacris) 
 Sometime wanna be your lover, 
 Sometime wanna be your friend, 
 Sometime wanna hug ya, 
 Hold hands, slow-dance while the record spins, 
 Opened up your heart 'cause you said I made you feel so comfortable, 
 Used to play back then, now you all grown-up like Rudy Huxtable, 
 I could be your buck, you could beat me up, 
 Play-fight in the dark, then we both make up, 
 I'd do anything just to feel your butt, 
 Why you got me so messed up? 
 I don't know, but you gotta stop trippin', 
 Be a good girl now, turn around, and get these whippings, 
 You know you like it like that, 
 You don't have to fight back, 
 Here's a pillow - bite... that, 
 And I'll be settin' separate plays, 
 So on all these separate days, 
 Your legs can go they separate... ways...

 Tell me again (Tell me again, my baby),

 But you ain't been nuttin' but a friend to me (shawty), 
 And a nigga never ever dreamed we'd be (shawty), 
 Up in here, kissin', huggin', squeezin', touchin' (shawty), 
 Up in the bathtub, rub-a-dubbin' (shawty), 
 Are you sure you wanna go this route? (shawty), 
 Let a nigga know before I pull it out (shawty), 
 I would never ever cross the line (shawty),

 So I called her mother's house and asked her had she had seen my baby 
 Drove my six around look for that missin' lady, 
 Got back in turned the TV on and caught the news 
 Then I put my hand on my head 'cause I'm so confused, 
 And then I turned the TV down, 
 'Cause I thought I heard a squeaky sound, 
 Umm... something's going on upstairs, 
 'Cause I know nobody's else lives here, 
 As I get closer to the stairways, 
 All I hear and then I hear my baby's voice in my ear, 
 Your contagious touch me baby, 
 Get me what you got, 
 Then a man said, 
 Sexy lady, drive me crazy, 
 Drive me wild, 
 And I just can't believe this shit, 
 I ran down stairs look in the closet lookin' for that eeww... 
 Said a prayer cause only God know what I'm gonna do, 
 What I saw was enough to drive a preacher wild, 
 I'm in the hall contemplate not in my own dame house, 
 Who would have thought she was creeping with another man, 
 But down low happen to me all over again, 
 And then I turned the TV down, 
 'Cause I thought I heard a squeaky sound, 
 Umm. something's going on up there upstairs, 
 'Cause I know nobody's else lives here, 
 As I get closer to the stairways, 
 All I hear and then I hear my baby's voice in my ear, screaming 
 Your contagious touch me baby,

 Ain't lookin' for nothing too serious

 Acting like a diva babe 
 It might be cute, but it ain't gonna get you much 
 I'll sink my ship in your ocean baby 
 Never mind the lotion let's touch 
 'Cause you're so focused on that fashion 
 And diamonds and flashy things 
 You say you're independent, but really what does that mean 
 I can satisfy ya, I'll ignite your fire 
 But only if you're coming with me 
 Then Ima... 
 Stroke your ego

 Oh it's you sweet baby 
 I will never be free from your embrace, sweet baby 
 Only hopin' it's not too late to try again 
 It's you sweet baby 
 Ever lost and captured by your smile, sweet baby 
 I will always be right there by your side, right by your side 
 Lyin' here alone I'm dreamin', my mind keeps wanderin' 
 My thoughts are only you 
 Wanderin' through the memories in my mind 
 How could love so real have turned so empty 
 I just keep wanderin' why 
 Will I ever find the love we share together you and I 
 Oh, it's you sweet baby 
 Though we've had such a long hard road to climb, sweet baby 
 Only hopin' it's not too late to try again 
 It's you, sweet baby 
 Won't you try and believe in what I say?, sweet baby 
 I will always be right there by your side, right by your side 
 Oh it's you sweet baby 
 I will never be free from your embrace, sweet baby

 Help to make the season bright 
 Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow 
 Will find it hard to sleep tonight 
 They know that Santa's on his way 
 He's loaded lots of toys and many goodies on his sleigh 
 And every mother's child is going to spy 
 To see if reindeer really know how to fly 
 And so, I'm offering this simple phrase 
 To kids from one to ninety-two 
 Although it's been said many times, many ways 
 Merry Christmas to you

 'Cause my heart beat says all of the words! 
 Yes you know, I'm not afraid to let my feelings show. 
 Two's company, three is a crowd! 
 Never knew what I wanted to do, when they were around. 
 Lost for my words, always in tears 
 But I've learned from the best, I should never run from my tears. 
 Healing from pain, I'll never be the same. 
 And my heart has got opened wounds. 
 I will always! Always feel this way, 
 Yes you know, yes you know, yes you know! 
 Two's company, three is a crowd! 
 Never knew what I wanted to do till you were found! 
 Lost for my words, always in tears. 
 But I've learned, but I've learned, but I've learned from the best, 
 I should never run from my fears! (Sing Slowly towards end)"

 It don't matter where we at, we travelin often 
 It don't matter what we pack, the gat'll be coughin' 
 That'll be that, either that or your faculty's softin' 
 Ladies stack that, ass phat when they walkin' 
 Gallopin like horses, Jesus, I just wanna get in between ya 
 Like, chilly when you thinkin' of me 
 But really you leavin' Dallas, Austin, it's happenin' often 
 I really could read you, rather by payment to please 
 To spoon feed, really who needs you 
 The longer I get, the longer I please you 
 Five Nine'll creep wit the people, keepin' it diesel 
 But who could forget you, I'm keepin' it street 
 While I'm shootin this missile, reachin' and heat seekin' this freaks 
 Royce 5'9"" is literally the head nigga that's breathin 
 The reason that chivalry is dead, so please

 Said you act like you're ready but you don't really know 
 And everything in your past, wanna let it go

 You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about 
 U got it bad when you're out with someone 
 But you keep on thinkin' 'bout somebody else, u got it bad 
 When you say that you love 'em and you really know 
 Everything that used to matter, don't matter no more 
 Like my money, all my cars, you can have it all back 
 Flowers, cards and candy, I do it just 'cause I'm 
 Said I'm fortunate to have you girl 
 I want you to know, I really adore you

 Before anything began between us 
 You were like my best friend 
 The one I used to run and talk to 
 When me and my girl was having problems 
 You used to say it'll be okay 
 Suggest little nice things I should do 
 And when I go home at night and lay my head down 
 All I seem to think about was you and how 
 U make me wanna leave the one I'm with 
 Start a new relationship with you 
 This is what you do 
 Think about her and all the things that come along with

 This is what you do 
 Think about her and all the things that come along with 
 U make me, u make me 
 Now what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up 
 Knowing it should have been you 
 What's sad is that I love her but I'm falling for you 
 What should I do? 
 Should I tell my baby bye-bye? 
 Should I do exactly what I feel inside? 
 'Cause I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay 
 But I really need to get it together 
 U make me wanna leave the one I'm with

 U make me wanna leave the one I'm with 
 Start a new relationship with you 
 This is what you do 
 Think about her and all the things that come along with 
 U make me, u make me 
 At this point the situation's out of control 
 I never meant to hurt her but I gotta let her go 
 And she may not understand it While all of this is going on 
 I tried, I tried to fight it but the feeling's just too strong 
 U make me 
 U make me wanna 
 U make me wanna 
 U make me wanna 
 U make me wanna

 You're either with us - or against us, yo

 Since we hit the floor to get down 
 We always had a step to go with the sound 
 Now everybody want to sit around, drink and ball 
 Remember, the snake 
 And how the floor used to clear 
 And everybody would break 
 What's crunk now used to be called getting to it 
 We're bringing it all back 
 This is how we do it, just 
 Put your hands up, bend your knees 
 Bounce around in a circle, get down with me 
 Oh come on, come on 
 It's not hard to learn 
 Come on, come on 
 It's called the you-Turn 
 Put your hands up, bend your knees 
 Bounce around in a circle, get down with me 
 Oh come on, come on 
 It's not hard to learn 
 Come on, come on 
 It's called the you-Turn 
 In the 80s, fresh was the talk 
 MJ had everybody doing the moonwalk 
 In the 90s, I had a high flat top 
 Doing the wop, Pee Wee to the Reebok 
 I can't forget about my high school days 
 The sound was Bobby Brown 
 The dance was the running man 
 Now everybody want to push Bentley's 
 The year is 2 - everybody do the you-Turn 
 Put your hands up, bend your knees 
 Bounce around in a circle, get down with me 
 Oh come on, come on 
 It's not hard to learn 
 Come on, come on 
 It's called the you-Turn 
 Put your hands up, bend your knees 
 Bounce around in a circle, get down with me 
 Oh come on, come on 
 It's not hard to learn 
 Come on, come on 
 It's called the you-Turn 
 All you need to do is let go 
 Let the tempo take over you 
 I came to have a good time 
 Let the rhythm deep iside your soul 
 Let it lead you to the floor, whoa 
 Put your hands up, bend your knees 
 Bounce around in a circle, get down with me 
 Oh come on, come on

 When it time, only niggaz rock designer first (first) 
 And we pull up and we crush the curb 
 And the rims so deep you can't find your feet (find your feet) 
 Can't see past the truck, past the phantom, the clique 
 I catch Hummer, Benz, and Bentlys 
 Wrist froze, step on the grease, crush the guard and 
 With Jay-Z twisting up weed 
 The Big Bad Wolf he'll puff your hut down 
 The gauge I'll buck rounds, leave you with no knees, the O.G 
 Probably bouncing to Rap music, the four life fluid 
 And it does make the chicks scream

 Trying to get a little Bia', keep it down on the low key (low key) 
 You should know how it feels (hey, hey!) 
 I saw the shorty she was checking up on me 
 From the game she was spitting in my ear 
 You would think that she know me (know me) 
 I decided to chill (okay!) 
 Conversation got heavy, she had me feeling like she's ready to blow (watch out!) 
 Oh! (watch out!) she's saying, ""come get me"" (come get me) 
 So I got up and followed her to the floor 
 She said, ""baby let's go"" 
 When I told her (let's go!) I said 
 (Chorus: Usher + (Lil' Jon)) 
 (Yeah!) yeah! 
 Shorty got down on her knees, said ""come and get me"" 
 (Yeah!) yeah! 
 I got so caught up, I forgot she told me

 Got me thinking that it might 
 Be a good time to take her with me (with me) 
 'Cause she's ready to leave (ready to leave - now!) (let's let's go!) 
 Now I got to keep it real now 
 Cause on a 1 to 10 she's a certified 20 
 But that just ain't me (hey!) 
 'Cause I don't know, if I take that chance 
 Just where's it going to lead? 
 But what I do know, is the way she dance 
 Make shorty all right with me 
 The way she ""get low!"" 
 I'm like yeah, just work that out for me

 In the club looking so conspicuous 
 And RAWR, these women all on the prowl 
 If you hold the head steady, I'm a milk the cow (yeah!) 
 And forget about game, I'm a spit the truth (what?!) 
 I won't stop until I get them in they birthday suits (yeah, yeah!) 
 So give me the rhythm and it'll be of with they clothes 
 Then bend over to the FRONT - and touch your toes! 
 I - left the Jag and I took the Rolls 
 If they ain't cutting then I put them on foot patrol (let's go!) (ow!)

 Situations will arise in our lives 
 But you got to be smart about it

 'Cause I knew you could not sleep without it 
 Meanwhile I, I loved you 
 You were my girl, you see I 
 Thought the world of you 
 But you're still leavin' baby 
 U don't have to call, it's okay girl 
 'Cause I'm gonna be alright tonight 
 'Cause I'm gonna be alright tonight 
 Aw girl, your face is sayin' why tears in eyes 
 Should've been more smart about it 
 Should've cherished me 
 Listenin' to friends, now it's the end 
 And again no story can end without it 
 Damn right I loved you 
 You were my girl, you see I 
 Thought the world of you 
 But you're still leavin' baby 
 U don't have to call, it's okay girl 
 I'm gonna be alright tonight 
 Gonna boogie tonight

 To stay home, waitin' for love 
 So tonight, I'm gonna do what 
 A single man does and that's party 
 U don't have to call, it's okay girl
