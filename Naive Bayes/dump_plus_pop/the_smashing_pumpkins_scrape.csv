 Throwing stray a spark instead. 
 Gather strength down in my heel, 
 And dig it in the world I peel. 
 Way down deep within my heart, 
 Lies a soul that's torn apart. 
 Tell me, tell me what you're after, 
 I just want to get there faster. 
 I don't live, I inhale. 
 I don't give, I unveil. 
 Don't want to live in your misery, 
 I don't live, I inhale. 
 Sprinkle all my kisses on your head, 
 Stars full of wishes fill our beds.

 All this pain smothers me, 
 Like a bomb that you can't see.

 You must rise from the mounds of desire and change 
 Too late to discover peace of mind 
 Too late to recover me 
 All you see and all you breathe and all you cease to be 
 Taken down your only son and what he means to me 
 Your dream will be 
 To dream with me

 Take what you want 
 Take all of it

 Be forever doomed

 Lost inside the dreams 
 Of teen machines

 The lonely towers of long mistakes 
 Forgotten faces and faded loves 
 Sitting still was never enough, hey

 Graceful swans of never topple to the earth 
 And you can make it last forever

 Wrapped up in the pleasures of the world 
 I've journeyed here and there and back again 
 But in the same old haunts I still find my friends 
 Mysteries not ready to reveal 
 Your sympathies I'm ready to return 
 I'll make the effort

 And I'll always need her more than she could ever need me 
 I need someone to ease my mind 
 But sometimes a someone is so hard to find 
 And I'll do anything to keep her here tonight 
 And I'll say anything to make her feel alright 
 And I'll be anything to keep her here tonight 
 'Cause I want you to stay with me 
 I need you tonight 
 She comes to me like an angel out of time 
 As I play the part of a saint on my knees 
 There are some things I'll live without 
 But I want you to know that I need you right now

 On a live wire right up off the street 
 You and I should meet 
 Junebug skipping like a stone 
 With the headlights pointed at the dawn

 To it all 
 And I don't even care to shake these zipper blues 
 And we don't know just where our bones will rest 
 To dust, I guess 
 Forgotten and absorbed to the earth below 
 Double cross the vacant and the bored 
 They're not sure just what we have in store 
 Morphine city slippin' dues 
 Down to see 
 That we don't even care, as restless as we are 
 We feel the pull in the land of a thousand guilts 
 And poured cement 
 Lamented and assured to the lights 
 And towns below 
 Faster than the speed of sound 
 Faster than we thought we'd go 
 Beneath the sound of hope 
 Justine never knew the rules 
 Hung down with the freaks and ghouls 
 No apologies ever need be made 
 I know you better than you fake it to see 
 That we don't even care to shake these zipper blues

 To appear, to disappear beneath all your darkest fears 
 I believe in never, I believe in all the way

 And faith can't help you to escape 
 And with this ring I wed thee true 
 And with this ring I wed thee now 
 And with this ring I play so dead 
 But no one's asking for the truth, so let me tell you 
 If you spin your love around, the secrets of your dreams 
 You may find your love is gone and is not quite what it seems 
 To appear, to disappear beneath all your darkest fears 
 To the revelations of fresh faced youth 
 No one will come to save you

 Your strength is my weakness, your weakness my hate

 For saving what you can't 
 And now they're me, but I'm not them

 It's in the ways of my desire

 What I meant was, I wish you could 
 Be there forever 
 Be young forever 
 I wish you were there

 And ruthless in my teach 
 So vacant in my breach 
 I drive the dirt up her garden

 No other lovers to bend 
 Just rotten apples to eat 
 Just letter yellowed distant scorn

 Flee these mortal bonds 
 No one knows I can't be wrong 
 So I'll sing the same old song

 For you 
 Why have you left me?

 Metal fingers clutching dirty sheets 
 And no one comes for free 
 In this place where the angels sleep 
 This is the last song 
 My eyes are open wonder to this 
 As you hold the secrets 
 I count the minutes off so perfectly 
 The shards of broken glass 
 Sing the strains of a sad old tune 
 We've made it at last 
 But what we had is lost inside our past 
 This is the last song 
 Could you find away across me 
 To forgive and forget me 
 To appease and relent me 
 To deceive and detect me 
 To understand and release me 
 To the dawn 
 This is the last song."

 And through the pinhole stars 
 Into the shadow mind 
 Will you lose him then

 So faithless serene 
 And she calls to him 
 Let the waste cross the ancient trails to you 
 Far out beneath the sorrow clouds 
 Let them taste the bitter lost mistake of you 
 Let them cry out through your rusted scars 
 Alone he roams inside the ordinary catacombs of her waiting 
 With raven hands she steals and staggers towards her man 
 Still scorned by his demon 
 Because he's undone 
 Become the language of 
 Disaster and love, vengeance and dust 
 And she calls to him 
 Let the waste cross the ancient trails to you 
 Far out beneath the sorrow clouds 
 Let them taste the bitter lost mistake of you 
 Let them cry out through your rusted scars 
 Dusty screams, through doors and imaginary scenes 
 Of hurt and teardrop 
 As he holds her down, in the cold lonely winds 
 Together again, her inside him 
 And she calls to him

 Far out beneath the sorrow clouds 
 Let them taste the bitter lost mistake of you 
 Let them cry out through your rusted scars"

 And below the angel dog 
 Combs her hair and sings her psalms

 She is Venus, she is Mars

 Upon my face we leave no trace 
 But in her stomach mercury aged 
 She holds the blood, she carves the knives 
 She digs the wives in our babies

 From place to place, and bed to bed 
 Gives of herself and the magnet head 
 Another floor, another ceiling 
 Counting stairs with double meanings

 To disappear in her? 
 To give her the priceless peace 
 Of giving up control? 
 We tumble out into the streets

 Bitter bred and so released 
 And by the no, and in the yes

 She wants clean sheets, and fresh flowers 
 And dental shots, and the Hong Kong glue

 And the night mare rides on 
 What I fear is lost here 
 The wind blows and I know 
 All you have to do 
 Is run away and 
 Steal yourself from me 
 Become a mystery to gaze into 
 You're so cruel 
 In all you do 
 But still I believe 
 I believe you 
 So may you come with your own knives 
 You'll never take me alive 
 With all the voice of what is true 
 Is there nothing I can do? 
 I can't go on digging roses from your grave 
 To linger on beyond the beyond 
 Where the willows weep 
 And the whirlpools sleep 
 You'll find me 
 And the night mare rides on 
 And the night mare rides on 
 With a December black psalm 
 And the night mare rides on 
 I've faced the fathoms in your deep 
 Withstood the suitor's quiet siege 
 Pulled down the heavens just to please you 
 To hold the flower I can't keep"

 Shattered as belief

 If you have to go, don't you cry 
 If you have to go, I will get by 
 Someday I'll follow you and see you on the other side 
 But for the grace of love 
 I'd will the meaning of

 But for the grace of love 
 I'd will the meaning of

 Your picture out of time 
 Left aching in my mind 
 Shadows kept alive 
 If you have to go, don't say goodbye 
 If you have to go, don't you cry 
 If you have to go, I will get by 
 I will follow you and see you on the other side

 Told me you were not alone

 Through the leaking roof 
 That you had left behind 
 You remind me 
 Of that leak in my soul 
 The rain falls 
 My friends call 
 Leaking rain on the phone 
 Take a day plant some trees 
 May they shade you from me 
 May your children play beneath

 Enchanted in the rapture of his sentimental sway 
 But underneath the wheels lie the skulls of every cog 
 The fickle fascination of an everlasting god

 Recast as child and mystic son

 Who wouldn't stand inside your love?

 Need and bleed for 
 Your every move and waking sound

 Down in the heat and the summer rain of 
 The automatic gauze of your memories 
 Down in the sleep at the airplane races

 To this heart a little bit longer 
 Try to hold on 
 To this love aloud 
 Try to hold on 
 For this heart's a little bit colder

 Written around the dried out flowers 
 Here we are still trading places 
 To try to hold on 
 Pop tart, can you envision 
 A free world of clear division? 
 For too long they held us under 
 But I know we're getting over 
 In Detroit with the Nashville tears 
 Like you said it's 
 Down in the heat with the broken numbers 
 Down in the gaze of solemnity 
 Down in the way you've held together 
 To try to hold on 
 To this heart a little bit closer 
 Try to hold on 
 To this love aloud 
 Try to hold on 
 For this heart's a little bit older 
 Try to hold on 
 To this love aloud 
 And we are still alive 
 Try to hold on 
 And we have survived 
 Try to hold on 
 And no one should deny 
 We tried to hold on 
 To the pulse of the feedback current 
 Into the flow of encrypted movement 
 Slapback kills the ancient remnants

 Crashing down again 
 Crashing down 
 Crashing down my friends 
 I've got to move it on 
 I've got to sing my song 
 While I still can 
 Dispatch the last alarms 
 Hand out the last few charms 
 There's no surprises 
 Only love 
 Only love can win 
 Crashing down 
 Crashing down again 
 Only love 
 Yeah only love will win 
 Crashing down

 To never linger 
 And yet it haunts me so

 Crashing down 
 Crashing down my friends 
 Crashing down 
 Crashing down again

 Yeah only love will 
 Be enough 
 Yeah only love will win

 You trade a piece of your soul 
 With no return 
 And who you think you know 
 Doesn't know you at all 
 Their drain is needless 
 Someday we'll wave hello 
 And wish we'd never waved goodbye 
 To this romance 
 We'll drink up every line 
 And shoot up every word 
 Till there's no more

 I don't want to die 
 I want to live 
 I want to try

 Of a vintl storm 
 One more cherry cola to lift up her dead arms 
 A dream of sot focus sunsets filters through the din 
 We are losing contact as she dials it in 
 She can hear glass calling 
 Or is it someone that looks like him 
 She eyes TV reflection and nods a knowing look 
 She says it doesn't matter 
 She never liked her looks 
 I have seen a thousand fractures 
 I have seen everything 
 Cause knowing is it's own answer

 Awake in my arms 
 You cry unharmed 
 Our age of the hours 
 While they still devour all 
 So take it all 
 I doubt if we 
 Will know it's gone 
 'Cause we've been here 
 Since time began 
 Begged god awake and make these plans 
 Wound opens 
 Reveal this broken man 
 And soon there's notions of blood on his hands

 Taste I will taste 
 If you love I will love 
 Run I will run

 Last night I turned around I thought I saw myself turning 
 Last night I turned around and thought I watched the world ending 
 Inside the crushing down I felt a pang the tide was turning 
 Destroyed in the wake 
 The jealous ingrates 
 Who'll tear this world down 
 To spite god above 
 With his own love 
 With his own love

 Lick clean the dirty fingers

 Cool frequency 
 And I don't know what it is

 Seeking sigh, oh so faint 
 I'm gonna run the slow dawn awake 
 It's blessed undone 
 The songbirds all around 
 And I'm not sure what it is 
 But I'm sure that I could give it 
 Awake the slow dawn 
 Slow dawn moves by my side 
 Teach your silent sleep 
 Slow dawn

 Washing down here, wasting way 
 They're gonna run the slow dawn awake 
 The slow dawn awake 
 The slow dawn awake

 Crack beneath her wheels 
 Tears of avalon 
 Streak silent down her shield

 Unfortunate attacks 
 Will leave you standing nameless 
 While she's turning black 
 Vanity stands naked at my door 
 Vanity cries, why? 
 Eleanor, you've lost me 
 In a haze of wine and cocaine 
 Gone out and cost me 
 Everything I blame 
 Broadcast in TV detail 
 To call their own stories 
 As I try to recapture 
 Our best in former glories 
 Vanity stands naked at my door 
 Vanity cries, why? 
 Vanity wants everything and more 
 Vanity must die 
 She swears she'll turn around 
 Turn around for good 
 She swears she'll turn around 
 Turn around for sure 
 You know you'll run around 
 Run around for her 
 You know you want to know so pure 
 Ease on that dirt road 
 You've still a ways to go 
 Soak in sights and city lights 
 While you still can borrow 
 Cursed fall will find you 
 And bring a memory 
 The ghost of her surrender 
 With the kiss of anarchy 
 She's naked at my door 
 Vanity cries, why? 
 Vanity wants everything and more 
 Vanity must die

 Of my own soul

 With all I'd asked 
 And all I'd pray 
 The last rose of summer would stay 
 First time that I ever saw you 
 Crashing hard through days of pain 
 You were one of god's children 
 Left to cry out in the rain 
 Waiting to be saved again

 For your fears, I am ringing 
 From Houston on a downer buzz 
 Like you said, It's just because 
 You'll detonate your long lost kisses 
 Wished on the eve of forgotten blessings 
 So start your way for a new impression 
 That try to hold on 
 To this heart a little bit stronger 
 Try to hold on 
 Try with this love aloud 
 Try to hold on 
 For this heart has never been broken 
 Try to hold on 
 Try to hold on 
 Pop tart, did you flatter 
 When they spoke... of my disasters 
 At 13, I lost my compass 
 But I'm sure, it's all accomplished 
 As my desires on my ghost trains 
 Like you said when it rains 
 It's pours down the back of the bitter son 
 Desperate for love and loves everyone 
 In my mother's arms, no simple harm 
 Conspires to hold on 
 To this heart 
 A little bit closer 
 Try to hold on 
 To this love aloud 
 Try to hold on 
 And we know 
 If we go under 
 We just can't let go 
 No, no 
 Pop tart, will it matter? 
 If I lose and just shatter 
 Will you cry, and keep crying 
 Will I die, and keep dying 
 In Tokyo, the sad tragic blues 
 Like you said, it's how you use 
 'Cause someday we'll know if this even matters 
 Our rings and maze and simplicity 
 When can we laugh and take all the credit 
 And know we'll go free 
 With our hearts a little bit stronger 
 Try to hold on 
 For this love aloud 
 Try to hold 
 For this heart's a little bit frightened 
 Just try to hold on 
 Just try to hold on 
 Just try"

 Into a world sustained with sorrow

 Is it lies. 
 Or is what we're seeking

 Behold and you'll find the 21st century 
 Detonate her will and her widowed speech 
 Buried in the backyard shadow 
 The rusty coffee tin 
 That held her mother's first kiss in a 
 Nameless dream 
 Fall down the stairs again 
 To feel alive against tomorrow

 And tell her of my fortune 
 Real love is riches 
 Scratch through the changes

 Demon scorn should not relax

 You traveled far, like a star 
 And you are 
 All of those yesterdays 
 Coming down 
 Is it something someone said? 
 Was it something someone said? 
 Yesterday the sky was you 
 And I still feel the same 
 Nothing left for me to do 
 And I still feel the same 
 I wish, I wish I could fly 
 I wish, I wish I could lie 
 I will, I will try 
 I will, I will

 Anything that you wanted

 The strangest man won't let you breathe 
 Rocking on you in a movie scene 
 His words fill your mouth 
 His guests bleed sick 
 Devoid of touch 
 He lets out to the streets where you were raised 
 Sittin' home waiting for the coming age 
 You had to wait your turn 
 You had to wait your turn 
 Wake up early, wash up late 
 Satellites connect you to your hate 
 Your patience grows but your skin is thin 
 The pager signals they're coming in 
 Through the hole in the wall 
 You left the hole in the wall 
 Here's to the atom bomb 
 May everyone find a way to get on 
 A little piece of heaven is all you seek 
 In the same old re-run week after week 
 Their faces make you want to kill 
 The little piece of heaven singin' on the windowsill 
 No lights can turn you on 
 Pixelate the night 
 Reading the words 
 Of your eyes on the streets where you were born 
 Sittin' home waiting for the coming dawn 
 Near the hole in the wall 
 You left a hole in the wall"

 Still a boy perhaps 
 Simple silent humble human being 
 We will scatter friends 
 Like the whistling wind 
 You can see me wave

 Decisions made 
 Idea's mine 
 But the inspiration not 
 Dreams of hangers-on 
 Dreams of getting well 
 Spells of esmeralda 
 Amarose fortold 
 Splinters in the eye 
 Sentiments remain 
 Bones are never asked 
 Where are we going to 
 It was never up to me 
 And yet I pushed until it broke 
 I love the open road 
 And all that it suggests 
 Wheelwagon dust 
 Weeds and infidelities 
 And always swore our love 
 Never questioned why 
 In a wooden house 
 Immovable and silent 
 And drinking strawberry wine 
 Forever lost in town 
 And through the sleeping streets 
 Nightbound and heavy 
 Wheels in a spoke 
 Just a spoken foreign sound 
 Know my gates are high 
 My friends even higher 
 Forgotten in my mind 
 Yet the scars still lingering 
 Cloud the blue skies 
 I'm jealous of you birds 
 Was the only truth 
 In a world full of words 
 Hear the prairie sound 
 In a friend called Neil 
 The heart is pointed down 
 But my spirit pointed up 
 His voice the siren 
 Of greek mythology 
 I pause with my pen 
 I begin to defend 
 Every action taken 
 Every moment sealed 
 When I was quick 
 It coursed through open veins 
 The will to live 
 The urgency to move 
 Behind a panel door 
 Sealing cherry stain 
 I played my guitar 
 And lived those lonesome notes 
 Like a dog that's down 
 In a corner just aside 
 Waiting to be called 
 Waiting to be yours 
 Ghosts of a machine 
 Without purpose or will 
 I'll often speak of you 
 But the you was always me 
 'Cause when I speak of me 
 It's me I ask of you 
 So let there be no truth 
 Just trickery in rhymes 
 Time the only thing 
 Waiting still is death 
 I hope for resolution 
 Pray one defining moment 
 Pause without restraint 
 Barren without child 
 A child is who I was 
 A child is who I'll die 
 A child is who I'll die 
 Soot in my hair 
 And stars in my hands 
 Soot in my hair 
 And stars in my hands 
 Soot in my hair 
 And stars in my hands"

 So thus charmed, but hearts untouched by hearts unloved.

 Shining down what's left to face. 
 You hurt so bad. 
 This knowing, this fallacy, 
 I want so much to follow as I lead, 
 For love, I keep silence, I weep. 
 Dead suns rule dead air, but Heaven is everywhere. 
 Stars... 
 Torn from God and flung towards night, 
 Don't you want what I can't fight? 
 We are stars, we are. 
 The stars that shine, stars that bleed, 
 Silver seeking destiny, 
 So follow, please. 
 This hurts so much, this knowing carries me. 
 We want so bad, we forget we are free.

 So rise the lost toys, islands of white noise and purple haze. 
 We are stars. 
 What hurts so much is knowing we are free."

 I'm lost in your embrace 
 Is it wrong to say so?

 Meant for the poor of soul 
 Struck from the firstborn 
 Leapt from a ray of hope 
 Into a body I once knew 
 Built a mere kingdom of self abuse 
 Hitched to some rainbow 
 Once more, it's always yours 
 Once more 
 The wait hurts worse than the blows 
 Words buy 
 New life 
 Dust clears 
 No scars 
 Burnt but 
 Bright eyed 
 The sun's out 
 A still night stirs 
 The wait hurts worse than the blows 
 Is it wrong to say 
 There's God and then there's faith 
 Is it wrong to say so? 
 Withstood a thought so sad, I had to laugh 
 Cut from some polished bone 
 Crawled out of broken homes 
 Slipped on the afterglow 
 Into a worry and a cause 
 Stole from the bible chapter and verse 
 Stitched to an old sail 
 Once more, it's always yours 
 Once more 
 The wait hurts worse than the blows"

 Lost on this road, are there any real sundays to find? 
 Unbound, on the rising 
 The pell mell of the miser kings 
 As you saw what I'm seeing 
 Oh you'd thaw from the fires 
 There's pace in your gait 
 And wake in your straights 
 I ache from the center out 
 Lost on this road, are there any real sundays to find? 
 Lost on this road, are there any real souls?

 Don't see what I see 
 Don't leave what I must leave behind 
 Lost on this road, are there any real sundays to find?

 In this heart, a lonely hunter now

 Against the sacrifice 
 For what is love, if not cause? 
 By misdeeds we'll scurry home, 
 Dust in breath and bone

 And another mouth will come and take its place 
 It'll speak and speak and speak and sputter me dry 
 I will never understand the motive drive 
 Muck 
 Your words, will spite your face 
 Your words, will spite your face 
 Spiteface 
 Spiteface 
 Spiteface 
 Spiteface"
250,The Smashing Pumpkins,rock,Sun,"What it wants is four more years 
 Moving tears of pain 
 Lost I go into your hiding room 
 You'll be lost to me 
 Walking in the sun 
 I'll never feel the light 
 Walking in the sun 
 I'll never feel 
 Why? Confusion haunts me still 
 My will can't reign 
 Lost I go into your hiding room 
 You'll be lost to me 
 Walking in the sun 
 I'll never feel the light 
 Walking in the sun 
 I'll know that I never feel 
 Walking in the sun 
 I never feel the light 
 Walking in my sun 
 I know that I never feel"
251,The Smashing Pumpkins,rock,There It Goes,"There it goes 
 Playing with my heart again 
 I don't know when 
 I'm gonna come up for air 
 For you now, again 
 For you now 
 For you now 
 And the way you look at me 
 Makes me happy inside 
 Knowing all the while 
 I can't hide 
 Come and go 
 Wasting my years 
 I was born to fear 
 That there's something in the air 
 For you now, again 
 For you now 
 For you now 
 And the way you look at me 
 Makes me happy inside 
 Knowing all the while 
 I can't hide 
 When you've thought to come back 
 Would you take me home? 
 When you've thought come back 
 All alone 
 All alone 
 There it goes 
 Playing with my heart again 
 I don't know when 
 I'm gonna come up for air 
 For you now, again 
 For you now 
 For you now 
 And the way look at me 
 Makes me happy inside 
 Knowing all the while I can't hide 
 When you've thought to come back 
 Could you take me home? 
 When you've thought to come back 
 All alone 
 All alone"
252,The Smashing Pumpkins,rock,White Spider,"Wander slow 
 And your kisses chase 
 What must I do 
 If only for your warm embrace 
 If only for your warm embrace 
 For all they take 
 Must you complicate 
 And every little spider 
 That crawled up inside her 
 Is waiting for my phone call 
 And now I remind her 
 Of every single liar 
 Living for the killing stall 
 White spider 
 Where will you crawl 
 White spider 
 The endless paths 
 Began to scan 
 I don't understand you 
 I am, I am 
 Know who I am 
 I'm sorry you had to 
 White spider 
 You gotta get away 
 To try to stay awake 
 You've gotta fix your gaze 
 So you're not afraid 
 You've gotta bide your time 
 Before you want science 
 You've gotta play the part 
 Before you fall apart 
 You've gotta walk through hell 
 Scream you're not around 
 You've gotta strip your skin 
 You let them tear at it 
 I'm gonna take a piece 
 For my own release 
 I'm gonna shift to speak 
 Fuck the enemy 
 I'm gonna chomp my teeth 
 Climb on out of me 
 I'm going on around 
 Without a sully sound 
 Wander slow 
 White spider 
 How did you know, yes 
 If only which way to go 
 My white spider 
 'Cause now I'm reminded 
 Of every single fighter 
 That's waiting for just what she brings 
 And every little spider 
 That crawled up inside her 
 Who's waiting for the phone to ring 
 My white spider 
 Which way'd you walk 
 My white spider 
 Isn't all 
 I made this up 
 To make the scene 
 Beyond belief 
 I'm back on top 
 Just a cock 
 Out of your cream 
 I am the end 
 I shall not remain 
 Prying plaintiff 
 The end we skim 
 I cannot pretend 
 Each who collapse, yeah 
 My white spider 
 How will you crawl 
 My white spider 
 Will it on 
 White spider"
253,The Smashing Pumpkins,rock,With You,"Low, low, so low with you 
 Go, go, I'll go with you 
 With you 
 Take, take me somewhere 
 Wake me, dream somewhere 
 And you're peelin' back your eyes 
 Some disguise 
 Trouble you just can't hide 
 And you're feeling so low, so 
 I'll wait with you 
 I'll wait with you"
