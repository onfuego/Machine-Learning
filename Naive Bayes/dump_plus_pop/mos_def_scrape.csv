0,Mos Def,hiphop,Fear Not Of Man,"Bismillah ir Rahman ir Raheem 
 If you can hear me ladies and gentlemen then I'm very happy that you came here 
 Ooh-ooh, ooh, whee 
 That was for Brooklyn 
 Haha, we get it every time 
 (You got me on? Oh) 
 Shout out to all of my crew, East-West, North-South 
 All the continent, Europe, all abroad international 
 (Bring it in, bring it in, bring it in, bring it in) 
 It's a lot of things goin' on y'all 
 Twenty-first century is comin', twentieth century almost done 
 A lot of things have changed 
 A lot of things have not, mainly us 
 We gon' get it together right? I believe that 
 Listen, people be askin' me all the time 
 ""Yo Mos, what's gettin' ready to happen with hip hop?"" (Where do you think hip hop is goin'?) 
 I tell 'em, ""You know what's gonna happen with hip hop whatever's happening with us"" 
 If we smoked out, hip hop is gonna be smoked out 
 If we doin' all right, hip hop is gonna be doin' all right 
 People talk about hip hop like it's some giant livin' in the hillside, comin' down to visit the townspeople 
 We are hip hop 
 Me, you, everybody, we are hip hop 
 So hip hop is goin' where we goin' 
 So the next time you ask yourself where hip hop is goin' 
 Ask yourself, ""Where am I goin'? How am I doin'?"" 
 Till you get a clear idea 
 So if hip hop is about the people 
 And the hip hop won't get better until the people get better 
 Then how do people get better? (Hmm) 
 Well, from my understanding people get better 
 When they start to understand that, they are valuable 
 And they not valuable because they got a whole lot of money 
 Or 'cause somebody, think they sexy 
 But they valuable 'cause they been created by God 
 And God makes you valuable 
 And whether or not you recognize that value is one thing 
 You got a lot of societies and governments 
 Tryin' to be God, wishin' that they were God 
 They wanna create satellites and cameras everywhere and make you think they got the all-seein' eye 
 Eh, I guess the Last Poets wasn't too far off when they said that certain people got a god complex, I believe it's true 
 I don't get phased out by none of that, none of that helicopters, the TV screens, the newscasters, the satellite dishes, they just wishin' 
 They can't really never do that 
 When they tell me to fear they law, when they tell me to try to have some fear in my heart behind the things that they do 
 This is what I think in my mind 
 And this is what I say to them and this is what I'm sayin', to you check it 
 All over the world hearts pound with the rhythm 
 Fear not of men because men must die 
 Mind over matter and soul before flesh 
 Angels for the pain keep a record in time 
 Which is passin' and runnin' like a caravan freighter 
 The world is overrun with the wealthy and the wicked 
 But God is sufficient in disposin' of affairs 
 Gunmen and stockholders try to merit my fear 
 But God is sufficient over plans they prepared 
 Mos Def in the flesh, where you at? Right here 
 On this place called Earth, holdin' down my square 
 'Bout to do it for y'all, and y'all at the fair 
 So just bounce, come on bounce 
 Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce 
 And just 
 Just step two three 
 Just step two three and step two 
 Two, three and 
 One, two, three, and four 
 One, two, three, and four 
 One, two, three, and four 
 (One, two, three) Once again 
 All over the world hearts pound with the rhythm 
 Fear not of men because men must die 
 Mind over matter and soul before flesh 
 Angels for the pain keep a record in time 
 Which is passin' and runnin' like a caravan freighter 
 The world is overrun with the wealthy and the wicked 
 But God is sufficient in disposin' of affairs 
 Gunmen and stockholders try to merit my fear 
 But God is sufficient over plans they prepared 
 Mos Def in the flesh, where you at? Right here 
 On this place called Earth, holdin' down my square 
 'Bout to represent in your whole atmosphere 
 'Bout to represent in your whole atmosphere 
 To your atmosphere, to your atmosphere 
 Ooh, that was for you and Brooklyn too!"
1,Mos Def,hiphop,Hip Hop,"You say one for the tempo, two for the time 
 Come on y'all let's rock this! 
 You say one for the tempo, two for the time 
 Come on! 
 Speech is my hammer, bang the world into shape 
 Now let it fall... (Hungh!) 
 My restlessness is my nemesis 
 It's hard to really chill and sit still 
 Committed to page, I write a rhyme 
 Sometimes won't finish for days 
 Scrutinize my literature, from the large to the miniature 
 I mathematically add-minister 
 Subtract the wack 
 Selector, wheel it back, I'm feeling that 
 (Ha ha ha) From the core to the perimeter black, 
 You know the motto 
 Stay fluid even in staccato 
 (Mos Def) Full blooded, full throttle 
 Breathe deep inside the trunk hollow 
 There's the hum, young man where you from 
 Brooklyn number one 
 Native son, speaking in the native tongue 
 I got my eyes on tomorrow (there it is) 
 While you still try to follow where it is 
 I'm on the Ave where it lives and dies 
 Violently, so silently 
 Shine so vibrantly that eyes squint to catch a glimpse 
 Embrace the bass with my dark ink fingertips 
 Used to speak the King's English 
 But caught a rash on my lips 
 So now my chat just like dis 
 Long range from the base-line (switch) 
 Move like an apparition 
 Float to the ground with ammunition (chi-chi-chi-POW) 
 Move from the gate, voice cued on your tape 
 Putting food on your plate 
 Many crews can relate 
 Who choosing your fate (yo) 
 We went from picking cotton 
 To chain gang line chopping 
 To Be-Bopping 
 To Hip-Hopping 
 Blues people got the blue chip stock option 
 Invisible man, got the whole world watching 
 (Where ya at) I'm high, low, east, west, 
 All over your map 
 I'm getting big props, with this thing called hip hop 
 Where you can either get paid or get shot 
 When your product in stock 
 The fair-weather friends flock 
 When your chart position drop 
 Then the phone calls... 
 Chill for a minute 
 Let's see who else tops 
 Snatch your shelf spot 
 Don't gas yourself ock 
 The industry just a better built cellblock 
 A long way from the shell tops 
 And the bells that L rocked (rock, rock, rock, rock...) 
 *Scratching* 
 Hip Hop is prosecution evidence 
 The out of court settlement 
 Ad space for liquor 
 Sick without benefits (hungh!) 
 Luxury tenements choking the skyline 
 It's low life getting tree-top high 
 It is a back water remedy 
 Bitter intent to the memory 
 A class E felony 
 Facing the death penalty (hungh!) 
 Stimulant and sedative, original repetitive 
 Violently competitive, a school unaccredited 
 The break beats you get broken with 
 On time and inappropriate 
 Hip Hop went from selling crack to smoking it 
 Medicine for loneliness 
 Remind me of Thelonius and Dizzy 
 Propers to B-Boys getting busy 
 The war-time snap shot 
 The working man's jack-pot 
 A two dollar snack box 
 Sold beneath the crack spot 
 Olympic sponsor of the black glock 
 Gold medallist in the back shot 
 From the sovereign state of the have-nots 
 Where farmers have trouble with cash crops (woo) 
 It's all city like phase two 
 Hip Hop will simply amaze you 
 Praise you, pay you 
 Do whatever you say do 
 But black, it can't save you"
2,Mos Def,hiphop,Love,"(Mos Def) 
 They say the goodness in life belongs to those who believe 
 So, I believe... YES! 
 I start to think, and then I sink 
 Into the paper, like I was ink 
 When I'm writing I'm trapped in between the line 
 I escape when I finish the rhyme (aiyyo) 
 My pops said he was in love when he made me 
 Thought about it for a second, wasn't hard to see 
 I could hear he was sincere, was a game of promotion 
 The entire affair's probably charged wit emotion 
 But love call your heart, I guess you got to pursue 
 12-11-73 my life is testament 
 Praise the beneficent, element that rest 
 Devoid in the form that make love manifest 
 I spent my early years in Roosevelt Project 
 It was a bright valley wit some dark prospects 
 In '83, Venny C was the host wit the most 
 I listened to the Rap Attack and held the radio close 
 I listened to the Rap Attack and held the radio close 
 This is far before the days of high glamour and pose 
 Aiyyo power from the street light made the place dark 
 I know a few understand what I'm talkin' about 
 It was love for the thing that made me wanna stay out 
 It was love for the thing that made me stay in the house 
 Spendin time, writin rhymes 
 Tryin' to find words that describe the vibe 
 That's inside the space 
 When you close yo' eyes and screw yo' face 
 Is this the pain of too much tenderness 
 To make me nod my head in reverence 
 Should I visit this place in rememberence 
 To build landmarks here as evidence 
 Nighttime, spirit shook my temperament 
 To write rhymes that portray this sentiment 
 We live the now for the promise of the infinite 
 We live the now for the promise of the infinite 
 And we believe in the promise (love, love *repeated*) 
 Yes yes y'all and we don't stop because 
 I got love, L-O-V-E and I be 
 Love, L-O-V-E to MC 
 Get love, L-O-V-E and I be 
 Love, L-O-V-E I MC 
 Get love, L-O-V-E and I be 
 Love, L-O-V-E to MC 
 Get love, L-O-V-E and I be 
 The M-O-S-D-E-F-initely 
 Check it out y'all, feel me out y'all 
 Feel me out y'all, hear my out y'all 
 Check me, out y'all 
 Feel me out y'all, check it out y'all 
 Now hear out (bounce) y'all 
 Check me out y'all, feel me out y'all 
 Check me out y'all, feel me out y'all 
 Feel me out y'all (hear me bounce y'all) 
 Check me out y'all, check it out y'all 
 My folks said they was in love when they had me 
 I take they love they made me wit to make rhymes and beats 
 (Can you feel?) The raw deal, it's all wheel-driven 
 Contemplate the essence of beats, rhymes and living 
 Speech in line wit the rhythm, designed wit the rhythm 
 Ears and eyes keepin' good time wit the rhythm 
 I shine wit the rhythm, the Black Star Gallactica 
 Big number fleetin, we ancient like the Abbacca's 
 After us, I see most proceed to be trees 
 Sproutin leaves, given breeze to the we who believe 
 I MC, which means I Must Cultivate the earth 
 Back straight backs, hard beats and hard work 
 I be the funky drummer to soften the hard earth 
 (Amin) Pray Allah keep my soul and heart clean 
 (Amin) Pray the same thing again for all my team 
 This go out to Fort Greene and on out to Queens 
 Uptown to Boogie Down, yo just look around 
 AND SHOOK UP THE WORLD!, like Ali in 6-3 (right) 
 I'm reachin' the height that you said cannot be 
 I'm bringin' the light but you said we can't see 
 Saw the new day comin', and it look just like me 
 Some burst through the clouds, my photo ID 
 I bring light to your day and raise yo' degree 
 The Universal Magnetic, you must respect it 
 From end to beginning, ? true and livin' 
 EVERY CHANGING, it was a state of magnificent 
 Building it now for the promise of the infinite 
 Building it now for the promise of the infinite because 
 I got love, L-O-V-E and I be 
 Love, L-O-V-E to MC 
 Get love, L-O-V-E and I be 
 Love, L-O-V-E to MC 
 Get love, L-O-V-E and I be 
 Love, L-O-V-E to MC 
 Get love, L-O-V-E and I be 
 The M-O-S-D-E-F-initely"
3,Mos Def,hiphop,Ms. Fat Booty,"Aretha Franklin and Mos Def: 
 I know, I can't afford to stop (Man for real) 
 For a moment that it's too soon to forget (I was in love with this girl, y'know, I was to' up dog) 
 I know, I can't afford to stop (I'm tellin' you man, she was wild man, f'real) 
 For a moment that it's too soon to forget (It's just too, let me tell you about her) 
 Mos Def: 
 In she came with the same type game 
 The type of girl giving out the fake cell phone and name 
 Big fame, she like cats with big things 
 Jewels chipped, money clip, phone flip, the six range 
 I seen her on the Ave, spotted her more than once 
 Ass so fat that you could see it from the front 
 She spot me like paparazzi, shot me a glance 
 In that catwoman stance with the fat booty pants, hot damn 
 What's your name love, where you came from? 
 Neck and wrist laced up, very little make-up 
 The swims at the Reebok gym tone your frame up 
 Is sugar and spice the only thing that you made of? 
 I tried to play it low key, but couldn't keep it down 
 Asked her to dance and she was like, ""Yo, I'm leaving now"" 
 An hour later, sounds from Jamaica 
 She sipping Cris straight up, shaking, winding her waist up 
 Scene two, my fam throwing the jam 
 Fareed is on the stand, big things is in the plans 
 The brother Big Mu makes space for me to move 
 ""Ayo, this my man Mos, baby, let me introduce"" 
 I turned around (Say word), it was the same pretty bird 
 Who I had priorly observed trying to play me for the herb 
 Shocked as hell she couldn't get it together 
 I just played along and pretended I never met her 
 How you feeling? ""Oh, I'm fine"" My name is Mos ""I'm Sharice"" 
 I heard so much good about you, it's nice to finally meet 
 We moved to the booth reserved for crew especially 
 And honey love ended up sitting directly next to me 
 I'm type polite but now I'm looking at her skeptically 
 'Cause baby girl got all the right weaponry 
 Designer fabric, shoes and accessories 
 Chinky eyes, sweet voice is fucking with me mentally 
 We conversated, made her laugh, yeah, you know me bro 
 Even though I know the steelo, she wild sweet, yo 
 I'm 'bout to murk, I say peace to the family 
 She hop up like, ""How you gon' leave before you dance with me?"" 
 Aretha Franklin and Mos Def: 
 I know, I can't afford to stop (She blew my whole head with that duke, I was like, word?) 
 For a moment that it's too soon to forget (I played it low though, I was like, yeah, aight, come on then, let's go, niggas was mad, niggas was so sick, I tell ya) 
 I know, I can't afford to stop (Yo, honey was so blazing she was just, yo, she looked like Jayne Kennedy, word bond, to my mother man) 
 For a moment that it's too soon to forget (She was that ill man, she take me to the dance floor and she start whispering to me and shit) 
 Mos Def: 
 ""Yo, let me apologize for the other night 
 I know it wasn't right, but baby you know what it's like 
 Some brothers don't be coming right, I understand, I'm feeling you 
 Besides, can I have a dance ain't really that original"" 
 We laughed about it, traced her arms across my shoulder blades 
 They playing Lovers Rock, I got the folded fingers on her waist 
 Heating my blood up like the Arizona summer 
 Song finished then she whispered, ""Honey, let's exchange numbers"" 
 Scene three, weeks of dating late night conversation 
 In the crib heart racing, trying to be cool and patient 
 She touched on my eyelids, the room fell silent 
 She walked away smiling, singing Gregory Isaacs 
 Like, ""If I don't, if I don't have you"" 
 Showing me her tan line and her tattoo 
 Playing Sade, Sweetest Taboo 
 Burning candles, all my other plans got cancelled 
 Man I smashed it like a Idaho potato 
 She call me at my J.O., come now, I can't say no 
 Ginseng tree trunks, rocking the P-funk 
 Cocking her knees up, champion lover not ease up 
 Three months, she call I feel I'm running a fever 
 Six months, I'm telling her I desperately need her 
 Nine months, flu-like symptoms when shorty not around 
 I need more than to knock it down, I'm really trying to lock it down 
 Midnight we hook up and go at it 
 Burn a stoge and let her know, sweetheart I got to have it 
 She telling me commitment is something she can't manage 
 Wake up the next morning, she gone like it was magic 
 Ah, damn it, my shit is on Harrison Ford Frantic 
 My 911's unanswered by my fly Taurus enchantress 
 Next week, Mu hit me up, I saw Sharice at the Kitty Club 
 With some banging ass Asian playing lay it down and lick me up, what?"
4,Mos Def,hiphop,Speed Law,"(Watch it) 
 Relax, pump the brakes 
 You're speeding money 
 You'll smash your whole shit up (slow down) 
 Lights be changing fast on these streets money, slow down 
 (Slow down) Sleeping on the wrong cats 
 Clear like a megaphone 
 Pretty nigga heart skipped the metronome 
 Rocked the Trump Tower to the terrordome 
 Poor house to pleasure domes 
 Soprano, alto, tenor to baritone 
 MOS DEF one of the illest that you ever known 
 Rock steady baby, you a stepping stone 
 Smash your foundation into pebbles 
 My words leave your nerves unsettled 
 You take it to the next level down 
 Looking like a circus clown 
 Cats like you can't even get a pound 
 Worldwide from the river to lakeside 
 My stage show stay live, make the sound man stage dive 
 I cut fat cats to eight lives with my eight ball lines 
 I'm home 'fore I'm done with all nine 
 Got you shook like a fault line 
 Come all shine and get tarnished 
 Brooklyn got your pay roll garnished 
 They form a huddle 
 Whisper like they want trouble 
 I melt the ice grills into rainwater puddles 
 Make the proud-hearted leave on the humble 
 Black steel in the hour 
 Assemble my skill form my power 
 My poems crush bones into powder 
 You mumble like a coward 
 I'm Mos Def, you need to speak louder 
 Super hereos! 
 Get your power, your masks and capes snatched 
 Brooklyn take what you can't take back 
 I know a lot of cats hate that 
 All I can say black 
 There's a city full of walls you can post complaints at 
 All the doubters and believers adjust your receivers 
 ""I feel it,"" you can taste it through the speakers 
 The three six oh-riginal sketch lyrics so visual 
 They rent my rhyme books at your nearest home video 
 Tell them cats they need to sit back and observe where they at 
 Brook-nahm Vietnam 
 The heat is on 
 Put your joint on cruise 
 Try to rush you scuff your brake shoes, just cool and relax 
 Take a breath, take ten paces back 
 Stay on time Omegas 
 Brooklyn patrol like interstaters 
 Take their license and their registration papers 
 My joint's so passionate 
 Make you peal out and mash your shit 
 Get wild cold crash your whip 
 Front chassis wrecked, but ock you can't be too upset 
 Tow truck got my tape in the deck 
 I'm permanent like tattoos and birth marks 
 Third degree burn marks 
 Driving on tracks like Dale Earnheart 
 Stay on the low like the earth spot 
 Put a big loss on your earn chart 
 Nice since the nurse signed my birth chart 
 Seldom seen but often heard, while your jams is barely heard 
 Just my name is a daily word 
 *From avenues to streets, terraces and park places 
 Stair wells, jail cells, penthouse to basements 
 Arrangement basic, but still fans chase it 
 Y2K can't delete the true ancient 
 Apache war drum on the ranges 
 Skill level dangerous 
 Arrow head that killed all the cavemen 
 They cry John-Blazing, but step on the pavement 
 And get violated like a plaintiff 
 I ain't shit to play with 
 I give a Goddamn what your name is 
 Delete it and make it so it never get repeated 
 Believe it 
 Tell the feds, tell your girl, tell your mother 
 Conference call you wack crew and tell each other 
 That they just ain't holding me 
 I'm Mos Def, your hopefully 
 Mush off or you get bust off like a ovary 
 Tell them cats they need to ease back and observe where they at 
 Brook-nahm Vietnam 
 The heat is on 
 Put your joint on cruise 
 In a rush you scuff your brake shoes, just cool and relax 
 Take a breath, take ten paces back 
 Brook-nahm Vietnam 
 The heat is on, no off-ramp or detour 
 Make these gassed up jokers observe the speed law 
 Make these gassed up clowns observe the speed law 
 Make these gassed up clowns observe the speed law 
 'Cause they speedin, speedin, speedin, speedin, speedin, 
 Speedin, speedin, speedin, speedin, speedin, 
 Speedin, speedin, speedin, speedin, speedin 
 Relax 
 Slow down, you better chill money 
 Lights be changing fast on these streets dude 
 Smash your whole shit up 
 You better cool out money 
 It ain't like that out here 
 Look at these cats man, it's funny man 
 He probably just got that car 
 About to fuck your whole shit up 
 Speed laws out here money 
 Knight riding cats 
 In control like interstaters, state-ahs, state-ahs, 
 State-ahs, state-ahs, state-ahs, state-ahs, state-ahs, 
 State-ahs, state-ahs, state-ahs, state-ahs, state-ahs, 
 Stay the... FUCK off the road, money!..."

 Out in Brooklyn late night flashing all of your rocks 
 Got, this is how you get got 
 Some girl from pink house said, ""I like you a lot"" 
 Got, this is how you get got 
 This one goes to all them Big Will cats 
 With ice on they limbs and big rims on they Ac 
 You goin' around town with your system bump 
 And your windows cracked low to profile and front 
 Now I like to have nice things just like you 
 But I'm from Brooklyn, certain shit you just don't do 
 Like, high postin' when you far from home 
 Or like, high postin' when you all alone 
 Now, this would seem to be clear common sense 
 But cats be livin' off, sheer confidence 
 Like, ""Fuck that, picture them tellin' me run that"" 
 But acting invincible, just ain't sensible 
 It's nineteen ninety-now, and there's certain individuals 
 Swear they rollin' hard and get robbed on principle 
 Five star general, flashin' on your revenue 
 You takin' a ride on the downstate medical, Like whoo 
 Colorful sparks, yellow and blue 
 A full on attack and it's happening to you 
 Wit' nothing you can do but bust back and cop a plea 
 But five of them and one of you, that equals got to me 
 Don't get me, don't get me 
 Don't g-g-g-g-g-get me 
 Don't get me, don't get me 
 Don't g-g-g-g-g-get me 
 Don't get me, don't get me 
 Don't g-g-g-g-g-get me 
 Don't get me, don't get me 
 Don't g-g-g-g-g-get me 
 Come on y'all now, let's be real 
 Some jokers got a rough time keepin' it concealed 
 I wonder what it mean, it's probably self-esteem 
 They fiendin' to be seen, get hemmed like Gabardines 
 Cats think it can't happen until the gats start clappin' 
 They comin' down the wire spittin' fire like a dragon 
 'Cause while the goods glisten, certain eyes take position 
 To observe your trickin', then catch that ass slippin' 
 Like, come on now ock, what you expect? 
 Got a month's paycheck danglin' off your neck 
 And while you Cristal sippin', they rubbin' up they mittens 
 With heat in mint condition to start the getti-gettin' 
 They clique starts creepin' like Sandinista guerrillas 
 You screamin' playa haters, these niggas is playa killers 
 Mr. Fashion, that style never last long 
 The harder you flash, the harder you get flashed on 
 There's hunger in the street that is hard to defeat 
 Many steal for sport, but more steal to eat 
 Cat's heavy at the weigh-in, and he's playin' for keeps 
 Don't sleep, they'll roll up in your passengers seat 
 There is universal law, whether rich or poor 
 Some say life's a game, to more, life is war 
 So put them egos to the side and get off them head trips 
 'Fore some cats pull out them heaters and make you headless 
 Don't get me, don't get me 
 Don't g-g-g-g-g-get me 
 Don't get me, don't get me 
 Don't g-g-g-g-g-get me 
 Don't get me, don't get me 
 Don't g-g-g-g-g-get me 
 Don't get me, don't get me 
 Don't g-g-g-g-g-get me"

 Sometimes I get discouraged 
 I look around and, things are so weak 
 People are so weak 
 Sometimes, 
 Sometimes I feel like crying 
 Sometimes my heart gets heavy 
 Sometimes I just want to leave and fly away (fly fly fly, like a dove) 
 Sometimes I don't know what to do with myself (ow!) 
 Passion takes over me 
 I feel like a man 
 Going insane 
 Losing my brain 
 Trying to maintain 
 Doing my thang 
 Hey hey hey hey hey 
 Put my heart and soul into this y'all 
 I hope you feel me 
 Where I am, to wherever you are (ha ha ha ha) 
 Sometimes I don't want to be bothered 
 Sometimes I just want a quiet life, with 
 Me and my babies, me and my lady 
 Sometimes I don't want to get into no war 
 (Black people to be free, to be free...) 
 Sometimes I don't wanna be a soldier 
 Sometimes I just wanna be a man, but

8,Mos Def,hiphop,New World Water,"(Mos Def) 
 There's nothing more refreshing (that cool refreshing drink) 
 Than a cool, crisp, clean glass of water 
 On a warm summer's day (That cool refreshing drink) 
 Try it with your friends 
 New World Water make the tide rise high 
 Come inland and make your house go ""Bye"" (My house!) 
 Fools done upset the Old Man River 
 Made him carry slave ships and fed him dead niggers 
 Now his belly full and he about to flood somethin' 
 So I'ma throw rope that ain't tied to nothin' 
 Till your crew use the H2 in wise amounts since 
 It's the New World Water; and every drop counts 
 You can laugh and take it as a joke if you wanna 
 But it don't rain for four weeks some summers 
 And it's about to get real wild in the half 
 You be buying Evian just to take a fuckin' bath 
 Heads is acting wild, sippin poor, puffin dank 
 Competin with the next man for higher playin' rank 
 See I ain't got time try to be Big Hank, 
 Fuck a bank; I need a twenty-year water tank 
 Cause while these knuckleheads is out here sweatin they goods 
 The sun is sitting in the treetops burnin the woods 
 And as the flames from the blaze get higher and higher 
 They say, ""Don't drink the water! We need it for the fire!"" 
 New York is drinkin' it (New World Water) 
 Now all of California is drinkin' it (New World Water) 
 Way up north and down south is drinkin' it (New World Water) 
 Used to have minerals and zinc in it (New World Water) 
 Now they say it got lead and stink in it (New World Water) 
 Fluorocarbons and monoxide 
 Push the water table lopside 
 Used to be free now it cost you a fee 
 Cause oil tankers spill they load as they roam cross the sea 
 Man, you gotta cook with it, bathe and clean with it (That's right) 
 When it's hot, summertime you fiend for it (Let 'em know) 
 You gotta put it in the iron you steamin with (That's right) 
 It's what they dress wounds and treat diseases with (Shout it out) 
 The rich and poor, black and white got need for it (That's right) 
 And everybody in the world can agree with this (Let 'em know) 
 Consumption promotes health and easiness (That's right) 
 Go too long without it on this earth and you leavin' it (Shout it out) 
 Americans wastin it on some leisure shit (Say word?) 
 And other nations be desperately seekin' it (Let 'em know) 
 Bacteria washing up on they beaches (Say word?) 
 Don't drink the water, son they can't wash they feet with it (Let 'em know) 
 Young babies in perpetual neediness (Say word?) 
 Epidemics hopppin up off the petri dish (Let 'em know) 
 Control centers try to play it all secretive (Say word?) 
 To avoid public panic and freakiness (Let 'em know) 
 There are places where TB is common as TV 
 Cause foreign-based companies go and get greedy 
 The type of cats who pollute the whole shore line 
 Have it purified, sell it for a dollar twenty-five 
 Now the world is drinkin' it 
 Your moms, wife, and baby girl is drinkin' it 
 Up north and down south is drinkin' it 
 You should just have to go to your sink for it 
 The cash registers is goin' ""cha-chink!"" for it 
 Fluorocarbons and monoxide 
 Got the fish lookin' cockeyed 
 Used to be free now it cost you a fee 
 'Cause it's all about gettin' that cash (Money) 
 Said it's all about gettin' that cash (Money) (x9) 
 Johny cash (Money) 
 Rosanne Cash (Money)

 Understand, doing this for my fam 
 Ha ha, check it out y'all 
 Mos Def and Talib Kweli: 
 Yo I'm trying to make a dollar out of what makes sense 
 Add it up, told my daddy I'd be a rich man 
 You never know when your fate gon' switch hand 
 Get today's solid ground out of yesterday's quicksand 
 I was a young boy who dreamt about being a big man 
 On small looseleaf sheets I sketched a big plan 
 Gotta handle business properly, boost up my economy 
 Store it up and get my mom some waterfront property 
 Yesterday was not for me but nowaday it's time for me 
 The streets is watching me, I watch back that's the policy 
 Moving along my odyssey like blood through the artery 
 Navigate the treacherous and make it seem effortless 
 Let those who make the exodus seekin' the north beacon 
 From beating and hog-eating, from punishment all season 
 From hands cracked and bleeding, cotton thorns in your palms 
 It's for y'all that I sketch these songs and it goes 
 Yeah, though I walk through the valley of the shadow 
 I fear no man because faith is the arrow 
 My vocal chord travel worldwide to block narrow 
 We can blow with the ammo or go mano-a-mano

 I burn through your argument with action

 Who roam the frontier like a Buffalo Soldier 
 I follow the code of honor like a real man gonna 
 Never disrespect no women 'cause I love my mama 
 These cats be giving us praise but it ain't that accurate 
 I give it up to God, all that love and attachment get 
 Scary well-prepared with the shears when it get hairy 
 Like how these niggas is looking like some fairies and singing like canaries to the beast 
 And anybody who will listen to 'em clearly, y'all don't hear me though 
 Even when I'm coming through in stereo 
 You make a mockery of what I represent properly 
 Yo, why you starting me? I take that shit straight to the artery 
 Intellectual property I got the title and the deed 
 I pay for rent, with the tears and sweat and what I bleed 
 Emcees imitate the way we walk, the way we talk 
 You cats spit lyrical pork with no spiritual thought 
 Plus your flow a little bit off, you come across soft 
 Back in the days niggas like that on stage got tossed off 
 Need to get crossed off the guestlist 
 It's like you gotta be disrespected and thrown out the exit to get the message 
 Sometimes your sunshine get snatched like a necklace 
 When you get too drunk on power and your drive get reckless 
 Check it, emcees in my face after I slug you then I hug you 
 If I gotta dead you, know it's only 'cause I love you

 Shout out from up top (to the middle) to black bottom (Sky high) 
 Whether you colder than December or hotter than July 
 It don't stop till we complete this (and know that I love you), keep this fly 
 It's so much to life when you just stay black, stay black, stay black, stay black 
 Stay black, stay black, stay black, stay black

 People climbed into the night like space suits 
 People stepped into the night like moon boots 
 Marching like moon troops in their soot-colored zoot suits 
 People climbed into the night like cool wells 
 Shiny bottles in their hands, drinking their new selves 
 They say it's their true selves 
 People climbed up in the night like green trees 
 They were hanging from the night like green leaves 
 Buzzing like queen bees 
 People climbed into the night like space suits 
 People stomped inside the night 
 Stomping and stomping and stomping and stomping and stomping 
 Where are they going? What's the rush? 
 Everybody in the place was so out of touch, hey 
 Night-time is when the things get heavy 
 You feel alone and you want somebody 
 Loneliness whispers desperate measures 
 And you're frantic all by yourself 
 Night-time is when the things get heavy 
 You feel alone and you want somebody 
 Loneliness whispers desperate measures

12,Mos Def,hiphop,Brooklyn,"Hey hey, haha, say what, say what 
 Haha, bust it yo 
 Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner 
 Sometimes I feel like my only friend 
 Is the city I live in, is beautiful Brooklyn 
 Long as I live here, believe I'm on fire hey 
 'Cause it's the B-the-R-the-O-the-O-K 
 L-Y-N is the place where I stay 
 The B-the-R-the-O-the-O-K 
 Best in the world and all USA 
 It's the B-to-the-R-the-O-the-O-K 
 L-Y-N is the place where I stay 
 The B-to-the-R-the-O-the-O-K 
 Place where I rest is on my born day 
 Bust it, sometimes I sit back and just reflect 
 Watch the world go by and my thought connect 
 I think about the time past and the time to come 
 Reminisce on Bed-Stuy when I was pride and young 
 I used to try and come to the neighborhood function 
 Throw on my Izod, say a little something 
 When I was just a youngin', before the days of thuggin' 
 How me and Charlie Chims, I'm only bugging 
 Fast forward, nine now I gotta team my seed 
 I must proceed at God's speed to perform my deed 
 Livin' the now space and time, round the nine to five 
 For as long as I'm alive, paw I got to strive 
 I ain't sittin' roadside, that ain't part of the plan 
 I'm out here for my fam doin' all that I can 
 I love my city, sweet and gritty in land to outskirts 
 Nickname Bucktown 'cause we prone to outburst 
 Philosophy redefine us, touch mines I touch back 
 Walk the streets like a sweet and get beat like drum tracks 
 Catch no shakes over jakes, we bust back 
 Bring the marty to your face with no place to run back 
 I'm from the slums that created the bass that thump back 
 This ain't a game clown, play mes Brown and jump back 
 What you want, Jack? Young cats stash they jums at 
 Draw they guns back, mama screams where she sons at 
 Tryin' to hunt that, recurring dream of high stakes 
 The fourth largest, first hardest, Brooklyn is the place 
 Settled by the Dutch many years ago 
 Three billion strong and here we go 
 Mos Def and Roy Ayers: 
 Good morning Vietnam, haha 
 (We're made in Brooklyn baby) 
 (We're made in Brooklyn baby) 
 Mos Def: 
 Yo, sometimes I sit back, reflect on the place that I live at 
 Unlike any place I ever been at 
 The home of big gats, deep dish hammer rim caps 
 Have a mishap, push your wig back 
 Where you go to get the fresh trim at 
 Fulton and Jay got the Timb rack 
 Blue collars metro carding it 
 Thugs mobbing it, form partnership 
 Increase armament, street pharmacist 
 Deep consequence, when you seek sleek ornaments 
 You get caught, rode the white horse and can't get off 
 Big dogs that trick off just get sent off 
 They shoebox stash is all they seeds gotta live off 
 It's real yo but still yo, it's love here 
 And it's felt by anybody that come here 
 Out of towners take the train, plane and bus here 
 Must be something that they really want here 
 One year as a resident, deeper sentiment 
 Shout out, ""Go Brooklyn,"" they representing it 
 Sitting on their front stoop sipping Guinnesses 
 Using native dialect in they sentences 
 From the treeline blocks to the tenements 
 To the mom and pop local shop businesses 
 Travel all around the world in great distances 
 And ain't a place that I know that bear resemblance 
 That's why we call it the Planet 
 Not a borough or a prov, it's our style that's uncommon 
 From Sumner to Tompkins to Lafayette Gardens 
 Wyckoff, Gowanus, in their army jacket linings 
 Yo, this goes out to my cats in Coney Isle 
 Friday night out in front the Himalaya going wild 
 This goes out to Crown Heights and Smurf Village 
 The 90's, and all my yarda trini Brown's Village 
 Parkside tennis courts, thirties, forties, and the fifties 
 The cats out in Starrett City getting busy 
 To the Hook, to the East, to the Stuy 
 Bushwick and Canarsie, Farragut, Fort Greene, and Marcy 
 My Flatbush posse, generals of armies 
 When it's time to form, just call me 
 And let this song be playin' loud in Long B 
 If you love Bucktown strongly 
 Raise it up 
 Brooklyn my habitat, the place where it happen at 
 Live sway and the sharp balance of the battle axe 
 Irons is brandished at, thugs draw they hammer back 
 It's where you find the News Two crew cameras at 
 It's where my fam is at, summertime jam is at 
 They play Big and get you open like a sandal back 
 Hotter than candle wax, hustlin' you can't relax 
 The crack babies tryin' to find where they mamas at 
 It's off the handle black, with big police scandals that 
 Turn into actions screenplays sold to Miramax 
 The type of place where they check your appearance at 
 And cats who know where all the hot 'lo gear is at 
 The stompin' grounds, where you find a pound of smoke is at 
 Be blazin' John that have your wave cap floatin' back 
 The doorstep where the disposessed posted at 
 Dope fiends out at Franklin Ave sellin' Zovirax 
 You big balling, better keep your money folded back 
 'Cause once the young guns notice that it's over, black 
 Brooklyn keep on takin' it, worldwide we known for that 
 Flossy cats get it snatched like the local tax 
 The place I sharpen up my baritone vocals at 
 Where one of the greatest MCs was a local cat"
13,Mos Def,hiphop,Habitat,"When I think of home, I think of a place where there is 
 We all got to have, a place where we come from (Home, a place where someone lives, a residence) 
 This place that we come from is called home (A residence, the physical structure within which one lives, such as a house) 
 We set out on our travels, we do the best we can (A dwelling place with the social unit that occupies it, a household) 
 We travel this big earth as we roam (An environment offering security and happiness, a valued place a native habitat) 
 We all got to have, a place where we come from (A place where something is discovered, founded, developed or promoted, a source) 
 This place that we come from is called home (A headquarters, a homebase) 
 And even though we may love, this place on the map (Of or relating to a teams place of origin) 
 Said it ain't where ya from, it's where ya at (On or into the point at which something is directed to the center or the heart) 
 I come up in the street around some real wild brothers 
 With more than one name and more than one baby mother 
 More than one case, been on more than one run 
 Got more than one enemy and more than one gun 
 Partner, all that's left to want is more 
 While these cats that's less privileged is just more raw 
 Less space 'cause the projects laced with more flaws 
 Less sleep 'cause the nights ain't peace, it's more war 
 The can is raw like thirsty, rainy season thunder claps 
 On the block with your old pop pleading number act 
 To the spot with the red top fiends is huddled at 
 To the crib where the little kids spend their summers trapped 
 With the jungle cats, lions and tigers, leopards and cheetahs 
 For gazelle you get chased like a zebra, they blaze cheeba-cheeba 
 And dominate the weaker on the street 
 Hungry bellies only love what they eat and it's hard to compete 
 When they smile with your heart in they teeth 
 And the odds is stacked high beyond and beneath 
 Son I been plenty places in my life and time 
 And regardless where home is, son home is mine 
 We've all got to have, a place where we come from (In this world, travelin', travelin', travelin') 
 This place that we come from is called home (So many places I go) 
 We set out on our travels, we do the best we can (In this world, travelin', travelin') 
 We travel this big earth and we roam (Roam, roam, roam) 
 We all got to have, a place where we come from (Livin' all over the world) 
 This place that we come from is called home (Got to have someplace they call home) 
 Even though we may love, this place on the map (Yeah, place on the map) 
 Said it ain't where you from, it's where you at (Yeah, hey) 
 Some people live out in New York City 
 And some people live out in Atlanta 
 And some people got to live Chicago 
 And some people do live Miami 
 And all my people at California 
 And other people got to live London 
 And everybody got to live in the whole big world 
 Together just you and me 
 When I think of home, my remembrance of my beginning 
 Laundromat helping ma dukes fold the bed linen 
 Chillin' in front my building with my brother and them 
 Spending nights in Bushwick with my cousins and them 
 Wise town and Beat Street, uh federal relief 
 Slowly melting in the morning grits we used to eat 
 Sticking to your teeth and teeth is hard to keep 
 With every flavor Now and Later only a dime apiece 
 Old timers on the bench playing cards and thangs 
 Telling tales about they used to be involved in things 
 Start to drinking, talking loud, cussing up and showing out 
 On the phone, call the cops, pick 'em up, move 'em out 
 And it's all too common to start wildin' 
 I'm a pirate on an island seeking treasure known as silence 
 And it's hard to find, block parties in dark lobbies 
 Funeral homes packed but only dark bodies 
 I can't sleep hardly, stirred up like Bob Marley 
 Marley Marl played the symphony, remember we recall 
 Son I been to many places in my space and time 
 And whatever my home is, son home is mine 
 We've all got to have, a place where we come from (In this world, travelin', travelin', travelin') 
 This place that we come from is called home (So many places I go) 
 We set out on our travels, we do the best we can (Set on our travels, do the best I can) 
 We travel this big earth and we roam (The best I know) 
 We all got to have, a place where we come from (We all got to have, someplace to call home) 
 This place that we come from is called home (Someplace to call home) 
 Even though we may love, this place that's on the map (This place on the map) 
 Said it ain't where you from, it's where you at (Where you at, where you at) 
 Said it ain't where you from, it's where you at, say what, say what? 
 Said it ain't where you from, it's where you at, where to hang your hat 
 Said it ain't where you from, it's where you at, where to hang your hat 
 Said it ain't where you from, it's where you at, where to hang your hat 
 Said it ain't where you from, it's where you at, where you at, where we at"
14,Mos Def,hiphop,Mr. Nigga,"Say ho, everybody say ho 
 By the way yo 
 I said shake your soul like way back in the day-yo 
 By the way yo, everybody say ho 
 Everybody say hoo- hoo 
 Everybody say ho 
 And check it out now 
 Who is the cat eatin out on the town 
 And make the whole dining room turn they head round 
 Mr Nigga, Nigga, Nigga 
 He got the speakers in the trunk with the bass on crunk 
 Who be ridin' up in the highrise elevator 
 Other tenants who be prayin' they ain't the new neighbor 
 Mr Nigga, Nigga, Nigga 
 They try to play him like a chump 'cause he got what they want 
 He under thirty years old but already he's a pro 
 Designer trousers slung low ccause his pockets stay swoll' 
 Could afford to get up and be anywhere he go 
 V.I.P. at the club, backstage at the show 
 (Yes y'all) the best crib, the best clothes 
 Hottest whips on the road neck and wrists on froze (say word) 
 Checks with O's o-o-o-o-ohs 
 Straight all across the globe watch got three time-zones 
 Keep the digital phone up to his dome 
 Two assistants, two bank accounts, two homes 
 One problem; even with the O's on his check 
 The po-po stop him and show no respect 
 ""Is there a problem officer?"" Damn straight, it's called race 
 That motivate the jake (woo-woo) to give chase 
 Say they want you successful, but that ain't the case 
 You livin' large, your skin is dark they flash a light in your face 
 Now, who is cat dining out on the town 
 Maitre'd wanna take a whole year to sit him down 
 Mr Nigga, Nigga, Nigga 
 He got the speakers in the trunk with the bass on crunk 
 Now, who is the cat at Armani buyin wears 
 With the tourists who be askin him, do you work here? 
 Mr Nigga, Nigga, Nigga 
 Nigga, Nigga 
 Yo, the Abstract with the Mighty Mos Def 
 White folks got it muffled across beneath they breathe 
 ""I didn't say it.."" 
 But they'll say it out loud again 
 When they get with they close associates and friends 
 You know, sneak it in with they friends at the job 
 Happy hour at the bar while this song is in they car 
 And even if they've never said it, lips stay sealed 
 They actions reveal how their hearts really feel 
 Like, late night I'm on a first class flight 
 The only brother in sight the flight attendant catch fright 
 I sit down in my seat, 2C 
 She approach officially talkin' about, ""Excuse me"" 
 Her lips curl up into a tight space 
 'Cause she don't believe that I'm in the right place 
 Showed her my boarding pass, and then she sort of gasped 
 All embarrassed put an extra lime on my water glass 
 An hour later here she comes by walkin' past 
 ""I hate to be a pest but my son would love your autograph"" 
 (Wowwww... Mr. Nigga I love you, I have all your albums!..) 
 They stay on nigga patrol on American roads 
 And when you travel abroad they got world nigga law 
 Some folks get on a plane go as they please 
 But I go over seas and I get over-SEIZED 
 London Heathrow, me and my people 
 They think that illegal's a synonym for negro 
 Far away places, customs agents flagrant 
 They think the dark face is smuggle weight in they cases 
 Bags inspected, now we arrested 
 Attention directed to contents of our intestines 
 Urinalyis followed by X-rays 
 Interrogated and detained till damn near the next day 
 No evidence, no apology and no regard 
 Even for the big American rap star 
 For us especially, us most especially 
 A Mr Nigga VIP jail cell just for me 
 ""If I knew you were coming I'd have baked a cake 
 Just got some shoe-polish, painted my face"" 
 They say they want you successful, but then they make it stressful 
 You start keepin' pace, they start changin up the tempo 
 Now, who is cat riding out on the town 
 State trooper wanna stop him in his ride, pat him down 
 Mr Nigga, Nigga, Nigga 
 He got the speakers in the trunk with the bass on crunk 
 Now, who is the cat with the hundred dollar bill 
 They gotta send it to the back to make sure the shit is real 
 Mr Nigga, Nigga, Nigga 
 Nigga, Nigga... Nigga 
 You can laugh and criticize Michael Jackson if you wanna 
 Woody Allen, molested and married his step-daughter 
 Same press kickin dirt on Michael's name 
 Show Woody and Soon-Yi at the playoff game, holdin' hands 
 Sit back and just bug, think about that 
 Would he get that type of dap if his name was Woody Black? 
 O.J. found innocent by a jury of his peers 
 And they been fuckin' with that nigga for last five years 
 Is it fair, is it equal, is it just, is it right? 
 Do you do the same shit when the defendant face is white? 
 If white boys doin' it, well, it's success 
 When I start doin', well, it's suspect 
 Don't hate me, my folks is poor, I just got money 
 America's five centuries deep in cotton money 
 You see a lot of brothers caked up, yo straight up 
 It's new, y'all livin' off of slave traders paper 
 But I'm a live though, yo I'm a live though 
 I'm puttin' up the big swing for my kids yo 
 Got my mom the fat water-front crib yo 
 I'm a get her them pretty bay windows 
 I'm a cop a nice home to provide in 
 A safe environment for seeds to reside in 
 A fresh whip for my whole family to ride in 
 And if I'm still Mr Nigga, I won't find it suprisin"
15,Mos Def,hiphop,Mathematics,"Bucka-bucka-bucka-bucka-bucka-bucka, haha 
 You know the deal, it's just me, yo 
 Beats by Su-Primo for all of my people, negroes and latinos 
 And even the gringos 
 Yo, check it, one for Charlie Hustle, two for Steady Rock 
 Three for the forthcoming live future shock 
 It's five dimensions, six senses, seven firmaments of Heaven and Hell 
 Eight million stories to tell 
 Nine planets faithfully keep in orbit with the probable tenth 
 The universe expands length 
 The body of my text possess extra strength 
 Power-lift the powerless up out of this towering inferno 
 My ink so hot it burn through the journal 
 I'm blacker than midnight on Broadway and Myrtle 
 Hip hop passed all your tall social hurdles 
 Like the nationwide project-prison-industry complex 
 Working-class poor, better keep your alarm set 
 Streets too loud to ever hear freedom ring 
 Say evacuate your sleep, it's dangerous to dream 
 For ch-ching, cats get the cha-pow, you dead now 
 Killing fields need blood to graze the cash cow 
 It's a numbers game, but shit don't add up somehow 
 Like I got sixteen to thirty bars to rock it 
 But only fifteen percent of profits ever see my pockets like 
 Sixty-nine billion in the last twenty years 
 Spent on national defense but folks still live in fear like 
 Nearly half of America's largest cities is one-quarter black 
 That's why they gave Ricky Ross all the crack 
 Sixteen ounces to a pound, twenty more to a ki 
 A five-minute sentence hearing and you're no longer free 
 Forty percent of Americans own a cell phone 
 So they can hear everything that you say when you ain't home 
 I guess Michael Jackson was right, you are not alone 
 Rock your hardhat black 'cause you in the Terrordome 
 Full of hard niggas, large niggas, dice-tumblers 
 Young teens and prison greens facing life numbers 
 Crack mothers, crack babies, and AIDS patients 
 Young bloods can't spell but they could rock you in PlayStation 
 This new math is whipping motherfuckers' ass 
 You want to know how to rhyme you better learn how to add, it's mathematics

 Yo, it's one universal law but two sides to every story 
 Three strikes and you be in for life, mandatory 
 Four MC's murdered in the last four years 
 I ain't trying to be the fifth one, the millennium is here 
 Yo it's six million ways to die, from the seven deadly thrills 
 Eight-year olds getting found with nine mills 
 It's 10 PM, where your seeds at? What's the deal? 
 He on the hill pumping krill to keep they belly filled 
 Light in the ass with heavy steel, sights on the pretty shit in life 
 Young soldiers trying to earn their next stripe 
 When the average minimum wage is $5.15 
 You best believe you've got to find a new grind to get cream 
 The white unemployment rate? It's nearly more than triple for black 
 Some front-liners got their gun in your back 
 Bubbling crack, jewel theft and robbery to combat poverty 
 And end up in the global jail economy 
 Stiffer stipulations attached to each sentence 
 Budget cutbacks but increased police presence 
 And even if you get out of prison still living 
 Join the other five million under state supervision 
 This is business, no faces, just lines and statistics 
 From your phone, your zip code to SSI digits 
 The system break man, child, and women into figures 
 Two columns for ""Who is"" and ""Who ain't niggas"" 
 Numbers is hard and real and they never have feelings 
 But you push too hard, even numbers got limits 
 Why did one straw break the camel's back? Here's the secret 
 The million other straws underneath it, it's all mathematics

 Speak language come straight from the gutter 
 Observe the terms that we trade with one and other 
 Like - what's good, what's popping, what's cracking

 The playground chants, with little girls claping

 The most special, most ghetto, most method, most valuable 
 Rep my avenue like is the damn state capital 
 Coming shadows to mind, a better mark of rapeness 
 On slaves who high jacked the slave ships 
 The hackers who remapped the matrix 
 And built the road back to basics 
 And getcha all off that strain shit 
 You know this other cats run game with, it's tainted 
 Consider this the moment that changed it: NOW! 
 Jack john's stand strong never bow down 
 Back off or get clapped dog right about POW 
 For east to the west, up north to down south 
 We show you how to REALLY make moshpit bounce 
 Show you how the gritty make the ghetto wild out 
 First letters that I wrote when I sketch the script down 
 I'm live with it 
 Low, middle, the high with it 
 And that's how I'ma live and die with it 
 I shine with it, rhyme with it, reveal and recognise with it 
 The ghetto know what time is it, when I spit it 
 Me 9-semi, an iron lion strike with it 
 See Dr. Know string a knot and make 'em ride with it

 Rock the booze water on any bully on your block 
 My flow tighter than a big titties halter top 
 Doper than a floyd flake that they bought they pops 
 Since I bright a con duke of course I'm not 
 My sharp mind join the dots and blow they plots 
 A lot of cats talk noise a lot, but then the noise is stopped 
 When the heavy sound voice in charge 
 And this is no limp bizkit this is jack's fat cock 
 Loaded up slightly back, ghetto black rock 
 Brooklyn got bomb-rush that you can't stop 
 These the hungry hands that gon snatch your cash box 
 I never gave a second what on ""the fuck is with y'all?"" 
 'Cause my first thought covered it all 
 You whack! 
 And I don't care what you sound since not mumblin y'all 
 Cause you can't do me nothing at all 
 Which means, you can't shine my shoes watch my drawers 
 Clean my cloth walk my dog moan my loan 
 On other words dude I don't need SHIT from them 
 All I got is hard rhymes and hot spit for them 
 And yeah, I got the country new (raaatttttt) for them 
 See how dark it can get for them? 
 Tell their mommas THAT'S IT for them 
 Get the flowers, they'll sing for them 
 A sad story how it'll end for them 
 That's what you get for not listenin' FIRE!

 (Let the sun shine) 
 Yeah yeah it's a brand new day y'all (Let the sunshine in) 
 Turn me up in the top a little bit dog 
 Little do you know, y'all gonna hear this one (The suns shinin') 
 Loud and clear, bright and early 
 Listen... 
 (Verse 1: Mos Def) 
 I don't hate players, I don't love the game 
 I'm the shot clock, way above the game 
 To be point blank with you motherfuck the game 
 I got all this work on me, I ain't come for play 
 You can show the little shorties how you pump and fake 
 But dog, Not to def, I'm not impressed 
 I'm not amused, I'm not confused, I'm not to dude 
 I'm grown man business, and I am not in school 
 Put your hand down youngin' this is not for you 
 On my +J.O.+ with beats by Kan-ye yo 
 My name on the marquee, your name off the payroll 
 Style fresh, like I'm still a day old 
 And it's been like that since the day yo 
 On more time than a Roley, or Seiko 
 Step on deck, your neck do what I say so 
 Get up or get out, get down or lay low 
 (Chorus 1: Mos Def + (Sample)) 
 (Let the sun shine) 
 Standing in the shadow of a fabulous man 
 Brooklyn nigga I am, Black Dante (Let the sunshine in) 
 That nigga, that dude 
 Black People, Lets Move (The suns shinin') 
 Shout out to my man Talib Kweli, yes 
 We on top-a top-a, shout-a shout-a 
 Check it out... 
 (Verse 2: Mos Def + (Sample)) 
 Slim nigga that casts a big shadow 
 Cherokee red to shoot the long arrow 
 Got more skill, more aim, and more ammo 
 You can get it all from a big or small barrel 
 Like, hail Mary, full of grace 
 Niggaz come in and shoot up the place 
 And make you pull up your face 
 The deck, I'm a pull out the ace 
 From the jungles of the empire state 
 Where it ain't no escape, 247, 718 
 And that's like every night, every day 
 From the place that I settle and stay 
 To the states, I'm collecting my pay 
 Blast off then I'm back to the K 
 Hold it down so my family straight 
 Represent in a family way 
 Pro ball not for amateur play 
 Been raw since the amateur stage 
 Before the press had the cameras raised 
 (Chorus 2: Mos Def + (Sample)) 
 (Let the sun shine) 
 Like a long time man of the way 
 You understanding me straight (Let the sunshine in) 
 Yes, yes, no doubt, excellence 
 It's what it is, what it is 
 And that's what it is, you see? (The suns shinin') 
 Ha, Fire... 
 (Verse 3: Mos Def) 
 'Cause it is deeper, sweeter, richer, crisper 
 Stronger reception and sharper picture 
 Revolve around God, and involve with niggaz 
 These elements I perform my scripture 
 And make Mos Def a classic modern figure 
 Brooklyn it don't matter if you holler or whisper 
 Your coming through clan, 'cause I'm right here wit'cha 
 Ain't gotta edit the slang, I got it, I'll get ya 
 Yo, brothers and sisters, fathers and mothers 
 The lovers, the leavers, the doubters, believers 
 The stayers, the quitters, the bitches, the niggaz 
 Rebel guerrillas the ghetto civilians 
 Y'all 'gon feel it from the first to the millionth 
 It's extra, ordinary and plain 
 I walk a thousand paces of light ahead of the game 
 By the time you get where I'm standing, I'll be gone 
 Y'all make moves, but y'all just move on 
 (Outro: Mos Def + (Sample)) 
 (Let the sun shine) 
 I move in, and y'all must move on 
 'Cause I move to strong 
 And I know what my feet move for (Let the sunshine in) 
 Made it go without a brand new car 
 Made it fresh without a brand new song 
 And give a fuck about what brand you are (The suns shining') 
 I'm concerned what type of man you are 
 What your principles and standards are 
 You understand me y'all 
 Be good to your family y'all 
 No matter where your families are 
 'Cause everybody needs family y'all 
 Raise a hand, you understand me y'all 
 Everybody needs family y'all 
 Be good to your families dog 
 Understand, no matter where your families are 
 Everybody needs family dog 
 Raise a hand, you understand me pa 
 That's what it is... that's my man 
 Family and my family Pencil Pete 
 My man too, all our loved ones behind the walls 
 All of those who still in the struggle 
 Masada Malia, Sundiata, Magic Mel 
 (Let the sun shine) 
 Life is real 
 To all the real soldiers, black people (Let the sunshine in) 
 We family y'all (The suns shining') 
 Let it be bright..."

 Pull up to ya spot on low 
 Shine brighter than all o' them cats they got on glow 
 Layin the cut like they not gon' know 
 'Cause if I gotta make a move dawg they not gonna know 
 This door marked private this is not fo' sho' 
 It's Mos Def what you call real fo' sho' 
 Is they what you call gangsta, hell no 
 They get a lil' pitch and go snitch to the po' 
 They all talk fast and they all think slow 
 I'm Mos Definite and I think so 
 Flood ya city with the black ink flow 
 And my crew ain't scared to let them things go 
 So, stop with the nonsense, like he conscious 
 I'm just all right dawg, I'm doin' great dawg 
 I don't play games so I don't playa hate y'all 
 Get it straight or get the fuck up out my face dawg 
 I'm like the second plane that made the tower's face off 
 That shit that let you know it's really not a game dawg 
 Your grind and my grind ain't the same dawg 
 I'm the catalogue, you the same song 
 So cool and ol' school like 84' 
 The one ya lil mami windin' up her waist for 
 The name that real niggaz got they hands raised for 
 Me and Mini got ya block yellow taped off 
 Don't push me (get off) 
 'Cause I'm close - To the streets, 
 To the beach, the bitches, the niggaz, 
 The women, the children, the workers, 
 The killers, the addicts, the dealers 
 The quiet, the livest, the realest 
 - And that's close 
 Don't push me, 'cause I'm close 
 To the edge, back, middle, and front 
 Strong back shit liftin' it up 
 From the big and the small 
 I'm like J. Brown +Gettin' Involved+ 
 An'when I'm lettin' off around don't get in the cross 
 Have ya preacher man speakin' low gettin' his cross 
 Tell 'em wild cowboy not to get off they horse 
 Before they find out the town law is strictly enforced 
 It's a real bad way to get ya name in the Source 
 Testin' the limits of a dangerous force 
 Ya ended up dumb famous and gone 
 Your people shoutin' out ya name in they song 
 Pourin' liquor on the day you was born 
 Find paint to put ya face on the wall 
 C'mon fall back, there's no need for all that 
 It's all good, we all here, goin' all out (all out) 
 All day, listen when this song say 
 Don't push me 'cause I'm close - To the streets,

25,Mos Def,hiphop,War,"War is a global economic phenomenon 
 Ain't a batch of guns on where, hellfire 
 Spittin', run up everything they hittin' 
 Some do they job to dodge the barrage 
 As sleek projectiles never stay bound 
 Fire bite invades the night with light 
 Loud, fighter planes shout shell rain 
 When they shot to kill cops on the terrain 
 And leave any brain that may remain stained 
 You god damn right this war goin' too far 
 Socialists think they converse with the stars 
 Wars found, my find the beauty in the stars 
 I level with death even beneath radar 
 I level with death even beneath radar 
 I level with death and she got pretty eyes 
 Nobody told me death was so damn fine 
 I go to sleep with that girl on my mind 
 Wake up in a sea, I wanna fire in line 
 Grab my heat, then it's get down time 
 One day I'ma make that girl all mine 
 But for now I'm a soldier abidin' my time 
 Writin' my rhyme behind enemy lines 
 Palestine, Kosovo, Cashmere 
 No different than the avenues right here 
 An increase in the murder rate each year 
 Paramilitary unit keep the streets clear 
 Curtains up on the theatre of warfare 
 Dramatic politics nightly preformed here 
 Worldwide from Colombia to Columbine 
 Don holders keep ya dollar signs on the line 
 ""I don't want to rule or conquer anyone 
 I should like to help everyone if possible 
 Jew, gentile, black man, white 
 We all want to help one another 
 Human beings are like that 
 We want to live by each other's happiness 
 Not by each other's misery 
 In this world, there's room for everyone 
 And the good earth is rich 
 And can provide for everyone a way of life"" 
 Fuck that 
 You know the drill 
 Fix ya face 
 I'ma hustle off the hill 
 Go get my money man 
 Go get my money man 
 See every hunter need to kill 
 Go get my money man 
 I'm old school from off the hill 
 Go get my money man 
 Go get my money man 
 I give a fuck what I do 
 Go get my money man 
 Go get my money man 
 Go get that money man

 Hear Me, See Me 
 Welcome to Soundview Projects 
 Bronx New York, 10473 
 Intersection action ribs touching 
 New gutter smacks replacing the whole Dutchman 
 Loose mamis fucking, they definite land mines 
 Dudes with no right hustle throwing gang signs 
 Empty in the webbings broke and underpaid 
 Fighting federal cases with legal aids 
 The unlit stage tonight performing lime desires to eat 
 Can get you in a 8 by 5, the corner's younger 
 I smell feel touch and taste they hunger 
 Next in line to rep these street signs to they blunder 
 Under, wiping tears from his eyes facing the felony 
 These niggaz wanna be Pistol Pete -without the penalty 
 His last words, promise me this much in death 
 Don't my boy live to retrace my steps 
 Minne- stay safe move quiet and get it 
 If you encounter opposition get a inch from they face with It 
 Later amigo, digest the day to end discreetly 
 Sex money and boss 
 My ties to hear me see me 
 True villain 
 Face covered, driving gloves 
 Commit by my lonely when push comes to shove 
 They say that grown men lay on they prey 
 Took shorts in the street 
 Came back and made up for that with that white sheet 
 Revenge is best served cold 
 Get it the same way you give it 
 This ain't fear I just need to get away with it 
 Son stop over here (?), you looking at me like I'm lame 
 But I'm looking at y'all like y'all call this the drug game 
 Grand child hosing sims 
 Put the heroin in queens 
 Put Pops Freeman on in the early seventies 
 I sat in rooms with money machines 
 Drugs sitting 3 feet off of the floor 
 Cover the smell of the raw 
 Chest moves like bars scale my connects untimely 
 King Henry from 12th street flooded the Bronx in the 90's 
 03 scene MVP and one Accord 
 Boss makes decision paper wins awards

 See Me, Hear Me 
 Welcome to Brooklyn, New York City 11206 
 Roosevelt Projects, wild rose water the plant 
 Son you know what it is 
 From the moment that you come over the bridge 
 And if you don't ride with me 
 I'm gonna show you some shit 
 Ima show you where my niggaz stay sure on the mix 
 Ima show you where the pain and the poetry is 
 Ghetto young'ns spend a lot of time alone in the crib 
 BET on the screen, walls and posters of BIG 
 Hustlers getting dough sitting low on the 6 
 Blazing up the ambro glow over they wrist 
 Hop in the game knowing the risk 
 Still down to load up they clip 
 Gamblers with hopes of rolling the trip 
 But when you hear head crack there ain't no rolling again 
 Snatch the dice and everything you want is going it in 
 This how it happens, good people, bad habits, diabetics, crack addicts 
 Asthmatics 
 Searching for the truth leaping through the holy tablet 
 The bible, the Q uran, or the ten crack commandments 
 Speak on it God, What's today's mathematics 
 The five day forecast, the Dow Jones average 
 The price of beer, cigarettes, bread, milk and pampers 
 Life is a test and we all got the answer 
 The streets keep calling its hard not answer 
 And on my government-my attribute-my all 
 So it's only natural I holla black and respond 
 Brooklyn stand up and make 'em all sit down 
 (?) We do not fuck around 
 That's what it is (All Day) 
 That's what is Niggaz (Official, Official) 
 That's how it is Niggaz

 That won't make it 
 She be home with the kids, this is no way to live

 I know it's surreal but I'm a hard headed still 
 Do things my way

 It's like I'm dying 
 Trying to hold on, my body says Oh No, Oh 
 Out there flying, the price that I pay for the game that I play 
 Ain't no game at all, 
 I'm up in the clouds then I'm spiraling down 
 Nothing breaks the fall 
 And he's so strong, so strong 
 It's like I'm dying 
 Trying to hold on, my body says Oh No, Oh 
 Out there, flying 
 Sounds of the sufferers pray 
 Silent noise and the sufferers pray 
 They say yes 
 I come home high and she start to cry

 Ghetto people in the world today, Get up 
 Look alive, breathe 
 How it goes 
 Mother, mother, had in her hands her first born son dead in her hands 
 The whole thing was a setup, a scam 
 They knew it was set up and planned niggas he worked with 
 Brother, brother 
 I don't see no brother hug all I see is thugger hug 
 Get rich and fuck the hug 
 All in one there's some gun smoke from the hug 
 Lookin' for the shorty gun stroke from the hug 
 That's how they touch the hug 
 But when I touch the hug, I'll make it bright or black 
 Because I'm bright or black 
 And I'm so black I'm bright, shine through the blackest night 
 Shine when I'm live, shine via satellite 
 Shout in the hood we get the picture 
 Cause every time you in the hood you got photographers with ya 
 What's going on? 
 Understand this is real life 
 This how it goes on, this how it goes on 
 It keep going on, this how it goes on 
 Ghetto people look alive get free 
 Get involved, remain to breathe 
 If Marvin was alive now, wow, what would I say to him? 
 Where could I start, how could I explain to him? 
 I know the modern world probably looks strange to him 
 Would he feel like the day had a place for him? 
 Global imprisonment sickness indifference 
 When he said save the babies was we listenin' 
 When he said Merci Merci did he really know that decades later we'd still be killin' folks 
 Did he hope, that we would realize 
 That we the first, son of earth 
 The moon and stars, the great beyond 
 We black and proud, we brave and strong 
 We raise it up, we quiet storm, forever fresh 
 And keep it on 
 Ghetto people look alive and free and get real 
 This how it goes on, and you say you say 
 This how it goes on, and you say you say 
 This how it goes on 
 Ghetto people look alive and free and breathe 
 Hold the beat, stop the beat, drop the beat <repeat 3 times> 
 Hold the beat, stop the beat, got the beat 
 There ain't nothin' to be afraid of 
 Ghetto people look alive and free and get real 
 This how it goes on, this how it goes on, keep goin' on, this how it goes on

 Peace, peace what's up y'all this is Mos Def 
 And this is a message to the people 
 If you see or hear goodness from me 
 Then that goodness is from The Creator 
 You should be thankful to The Creator for all of that 
 'Cause I'm not the architect of that 
 I'm only the... the recipient 
 If you see weakness or shortcoming in me 
 It's from my own weakness or shortcoming 
 And I ask The Creator and the people to forgive me for that 
 Thank you Brooklyn, Thank you World 
 Yeah, yeah there it is 
 Turn my voice up in the top a little bit 
 It feel good to be back 
 What's up ochenta? 
 Yeah, yeah, ha... 
 It's the Black Dante in your headphones 
 Speakerbox (freaky radio) freaky radio 
 (Everywhere on the dial) tell you a little bit about me 
 For my hometown, break down a little history for you 
 Myrtle and Broadway, Roosvelt projects, Mossie projects 
 Listen... 
 (Verse 1: Mos Def) 
 I stepped on the field from no league just home team 
 I Jumped out the stands and I snatched the rock 
 With the final seconds dwindling on the clock 
 Mos post up to throw up the tie-breakin shot 
 I put it through the net and let the world's jaw drop 
 Then fled the arena before they called cops 
 Tell the players and the coach I wasn't tryin' to blow spot 
 But the way they was ballin' made it difficult to watch 
 I was taught when there's somethin' you can change around 
 Keep quiet, you got nothin' to complain about 
 You got work to do, I don't know if that work for you 
 But that's how Mos work it through 
 And my work is personal, I'm a workin person 
 I put in work, I work with purpose 
 I get it there, on the water, air, the surface 
 You feel the impact? Niggaz yeah it's workin 
 Listen God did not make me a fearful person 
 The only fear I have, Is my failure to adhear his path 
 I would love it just to hear this back 
 On the ghetto streets where y'all at 
 On the ave's where the Jeep's go past 
 In the coupes where the seats go back 
 In the parties where it be so packed 
 And the atmosphere be so black 
 And them black things be so phat 
 If I could I would be so glad 
 But if not I won't be so mad 
 I'm still being a man, still feeding my fam' 
 And even if you don't see it my fam 
 I believe that I am, truly gifted, truly blessed 
 I'm yours truly, Brooklyn's own, Mos Def 
 I'm rockin' the hard right, ground zero, to far left 
 I'm, well balanced, with immense talents 
 Burn the script, then flip it to keep myself challenged 
 And that's the mark of a true champ-ine 
 That's whether I'm in or outside the ring 
 No fights, no tilte, no crown or reign 
 Feel my presence even when I'm up out this thing 
 Just trust, that's what I'm about to be 
 But until then settle in and rock with me 
 (Outro: Mos Def) 
 Ha, that's what its about to be 
 Ghetto people look alive with me 
 And say, We 'gon, stop by 
 Then we just keep movin on 
 Ghetto people, look alive and 
 Feel free, we just keep movin on 
 For Alliah, Left Eye, Jam Master Jay 
 All the great hero's who have passed away 
 Scott Laraque, Big and Pac, Feaky Tai, Big L 
 All the soldiers locked down in the cell 
 Lock up the flesh, but the spirit will prevail 
 To our loved ones, and deceased 
 Dyin' in the street, or quiet in their sleep (B.I.G.) 
 Rest in peace, your livin' in the mansions of our memory (+Sans Marie+) 
 Rest in peace, your livin' in the mansions of our memory 
 And that's real 
 'Cause everythin' in life 'gon come to an end 
 Because it must, and when it does 
 I hope that y'all remember me 
 With true respect 
 And ghetto love 
 Now raise it up 
 'Cause everythin' in life 'gon come to an end 
 Because it must, and when it does 
 I hope that y'all remember me

34,Mos Def,hiphop,U R The One,"You are the one 
 You are the one 
 Other brothers just don't know 
 You got to feel me on this one man 
 So real 
 I'm so sin-serious about it, you know? 
 I know, I know more than a few is gonna relate 
 So much more than a few (fa-really real) 
 So much more (on the really real!) 
 When it started I knew it was trouble 
 But you know me 
 Them ""hard an' e'rythings"" can't hold me 
 I need some shit straight out the movies -DRAMA! 
 Warm to the touch, hot mama 
 You put me all in like launch jeans and scama 
 You was Mrs. Mine 
 So fine 
 Went from ""we gonna conquer it all"" 
 To ""nigga I'ma see you in court"" 
 I woulda never thought (damn) 
 I guess I better think again (you know?) 
 OK, now the shit is really sinking in 
 We ain't just divorced 
 We ain't even fucking friends 
 Cause in the end it was all about the ends 
 But fuck that I know it gotta be more to it 
 Held up with bitter hate with crosses all through it 
 And when I looked, what did I see? 
 You on the other end crying like me 
 Expression on your face like, ""how could this be?"" 
 That's what I'm asking, ""what the fuck happened?"" 
 How could all the magic and passion just vanish (c'mon) 
 Went from outsanding, to makin' me shout, ""Dammit!"" 
 Can't explain the changes, behavior's is outlandish 
 Now I'm just stuck in the road feeling stranded 
 I'm in the dark wishing for the answers 
 On some ol' ""Biggie gimme one more chance"" shit 
 When we met your face so brown 
 Ya ass so round, of course I'm so down 
 Wish I knew then what the fuck I know now 
 Couldn't read the signs in the road: ""SLOW DOWN!"" 
 I'm too deep in the road now 
 Got me pulling over getting smoked out 
 Fighting tears that I can't hold down 
 Can't believe it, this fucka' got me weeping 
 I keep it a secret so my friends won't peep it (live man?) 
 But late in the evening I'm up, my chest heaving 
 I'm reaching in the dark and I'm looking for the reason (WHY!) 
 Did our love have to die? 
 You and I were so fucking fly 
 Can't get it off my mind 
 The things that made me smile now make me cry 
 You are the one 
 Fuck you! 
 I wish we never met, I wish we never kissed 
 I wish we never touched (I swear to God) 
 I wish I didn't love you so much 
 I wish I could forget how feel, how you f- 
 (Damn) That's a lie 
 The shit that made me smile, now make me cry 
 You are the one 
 You're the one! 
 Fuck you! 
 Sometime I wish we'd come back 
 Man, I wish we'd come back 
 No lie 
 For real 
 Fuck that 
 No, for real 
 It's a dangerous necessity, it's a world famous mystery 
 Love 
 That's it

 You ever felt like the realest nigga alive? 
 Felt too pretty or powerful to die? 
 Tell the truth... 
 You ever felt ugly enough to cry? 
 Have you ever begged for mercy? 
 Have you ever wished you died? 
 Tell the truth... 
 Have you ever taken pride in the crime? 
 Been too hungry to break down or hide? 
 Felt low down dirty? Or super duper high? 
 Or contemplated murder, robbery, or suicide? 
 Tell the truth... 
 Taken medicine for trouble in your mind? 
 Or taken down a number? For taking up a scheme? 
 I made her wild, beautiful take her till she skeet? 
 Take her to the penthouse or take her to the skreet? 
 Tell the Truth...

 And every buggy on the block got the tune on blast 
 The TV is like the radio with visuals too 
 So shiny, so gutter, mean moody and cool 
 Tell the truth... 
 They might be doing things that you wanna' do 
 You fantasize as they be living it through 
 The big home with the beautiful view 
 You have a swim in the pool, and get fresh 
 And take a spin in the coupe 
 Tell the truth... 
 You probably want to feel the world in your palm 
 While hold a gun in your hand 
 And make 'em know you a star 
 Tell the truth... 
 And there's those who probably already are 
 They well known in they zone 
 Or they town or they block 
 Tell the truth... 
 Then there's the rest who are usually not 
 And the heavy dose of thug feel like all that they got 
 So they ready to rock... R-r-rock... 
 Ha, ha, heh 
 Gangsta, birth sign is danger 
 It's like thug is the drug 
 That make 'em fall in love 
 When love don't love nobody

 Sometimes I feel like my only friend

 Long as I live here believe I'm on fire hey 
 'Cause it's the B-the-R-the-O-the-O-K 
 L-Y-N is the place where I stay

 The B-to-the-R-the-O-the-O-K 
 Place where I rest is on my born day 
 Bust it, sometimes I sit back and just reflect 
 Watch the world go by and my thought connect 
 I think about the time past and the time to come 
 Reminesce on Bed-Stuy when I was pride and young 
 I used to try and come, to the neighborhood function 
 Throw on my Izod, say a little something 
 When I was just a youngin, before the days of thuggin' 
 How me and Charlie Chims (aiyyo what?) I'm only buggin 
 Fast forward, Nine-Now I gotta team my seed 
 I must proceed at God's speed to perform my deed 
 Livin' the now space and time, round the nine to five 
 For as long as I'm alive, paw I got to strive 
 I ain't sittin' roadside, that ain't harder to plan 
 I'm out here for my fam doin' all that I can 
 I love my city, sweet and gritty in land to outskirts 
 Nickname Bucktown 'cause we grown to outburst 
 Philosophy redefine us, touch mines I touch back 
 Walk the streets like a sweet and get beat like drum tracks 
 Catch no shakes over jakes (boomp-boomp!) we bust back 
 Bring the marty to your face wit no place to run back 
 I'm from the slums that created the bass that thump back 
 This ain't a game clown, play ya James Brown and jump back 
 What you want, Jack? Young cats stash they jums at 
 Draw they guns back, momma screams where she sons at 
 Tryin' to hunt that, recurring dream of high stakes 
 The fourth largest, first artist, Brooklyn is the place 
 Settled by the judge many years ago 
 Three billion strong and here we go 
 Good morninnnnnnnnngg vietnam! 
 Ha (back up back up back up back up back up) [repeated in background] 
 Yo sometimes I sit back, reflect on the place that I live at 
 Unlike any place I ever been at 
 The home of big gats, deep dish hammer rim caps 
 Have a mishap, push ya wig back 
 Where you go to get the fresh trim at 
 Four on the jake got the Timb rack 
 Blue collars metro carding it 
 Thugs mobbin it, form partnership 
 Increase armorment, street pharmacist 
 Deep consequence, when you seek sleek ornaments 
 You get caught, rode the white horse and can't get off 
 Big dogs that trick off just get sent off 
 They shoebox stash is all they seeds gotta live off 
 It's real yo but still yo, it's love here 
 And it's felt by anybody that come here 
 Out of towners take the train, plane and bus here 
 Must be something that they really want here 
 One year as a resident, deeper sentiment 
 Shoutout ""Go Brooklyn!"", they representin it 
 Sittin' on they front stoop sippin Guinesses 
 Usin' native dialect in they sentences 
 From the treeline blocks to the tenaments 
 To the Mom and Pop local shop menaces 
 Travel all around the world in great distances 
 And ain't a place that I know that bear resemblance 
 That's why we it The Planet 
 Not a borough or a prov, it's our style that's uncalm 
 From ?sun? to the ? to the Lafayette Gardens 
 White ?coff guawinas? in they army jacket linings 
 Yo this goes out to my cats in Coney Isle 
 Friday night out in front The Himalaya goin' wild 
 This goes out to Crown Heights and Smurv Village 
 The nighties, and all my ?yarda trenny? Brown's Village 
 Parkside tennants caught, thirties, forties, and the fifties 
 The cats out in Starite City gettin' busy 
 To the Hook, to the East, to the Stuy 
 Bushwick and Kanarcy, Farraget, Fullgreen, and Marcy 
 My Flatbush posse, generals of armies 
 When it's time to form, just call me 
 And let this song be, playin' loud in Long B 
 If you love Bucktown STRONGLY! 
 Raise it up! 
 Brooklyn my habitat, the place where it happen at 
 Live sway and the sharp balance of the battle axe 
 Irons is brandished at, thugs draw they hammer back 
 It's where you find the news tool crew cameras at 
 It's where my fam is at, summertime jame is at 
 They play Big and get you open like a sandal back 
 Hotter than candle wax, hustlin you can't relax 
 The crack babies tryin' to find where they mama's at 
 It's off the handle black, wit big police scandals that 
 Turn into actions screenplays sold to Miramax 
 The type of place where they check your appearance at 
 And cats who know where all the hot 'lo gear is at 
 The stompin grounds, where you find a pound, smoke is that 
 Be blazin' charm that have your wave cap floatin back 
 The doorstep where the disposessed posted at 
 Dope fiends out at Franklin Ave sellin zovarax 
 You big ballin better keep your money folded back 
 'Cause once the young guns notice that it's over, black 
 Brooklyn keep on takin' it, worldwide we known for that 
 Flossy cats get it snatched like the local tax 
 The place I sharpen up my baritone vocals at 
 Where one of the greatest MC's was a local cat"
38,Mos Def,hiphop,Dollar Day,"So there's a story about the lady in Louisiana 
 She's a flood survivor and the rescue teams 
 They come through, and they, I guess tryna recover people 
 And they see this women she's wadin through the streets 
 I guess it'd been some time after the storm 
 And I guess they were shocked that you know she was alive 
 And rescue worker said, ""So, oh my God h-how did you survive 
 How did you do it? Where've you been?"" 
 And she said, ""Where I been? Where you been?"" 
 Hah, Where you been? You understand? 
 That's about the size of it.

 Fuck you all 
 Napoleon's dynamite blew up in his face 
 Yoo busy handin out plates, now get yourself a taste 
 Yum, gravy over lips seekin' tongues 
 Price that you pay for thinkin' e'rybody dumb 
 Green and googly wide-eyed and surprised 
 Brows and lashes, honey mustaches, fried bride 
 Effort to little hit now holla cry pride 
 When the opposition forces came to take him back Jack 
 (Always gonna be hounded fella, by the police) 
 Oh-me-oh-me-oh-my, we don't assume 
 Secretly you probably relate 
 Loud lung tyrant, now you be quiet 
 Husheth, thou dost protesth too mucheth 
 Your deeds are on file, take your testament is bupkis 
 I feel like Lazarus, steppin out the grave 
 To give reporters of his death, the world's greatest nay 
 It ain't hear or say, you can see it for your own two 
 Sucker or get close and feel it if you want to 
 But I know you, you won't and can't do 
 Seamstress and lies are bustin' up your handle 
 Palms and fingertips on ultra-blister 
 You crossed a good dude now he cued the ultra-disher 
 Shell position fill your old tradition self 
 Machine gun ran in the pad and clipped himself 
 Now your project sinks up leakin 
 Hand over head and the sticky red is seepin 
 Weepin willow goin' onry ape shit 
 Little homey onlooker shout,""He ain't gon' make it!"" 
 The moment where bullies find God 
 Dumb-ass, he been on the scene all along 
 Tried to help you steer clear, you sped up to the climax 
 The brick wall on your cheeks worse than Imax 
 Heavy child I know you wish you never tried black 
 Dante air blow craft you can't hijack 
 Yes, but really I digress 
 Let me step aside and let the EMS clean up the drecks 
 Extra gore soak the medics to they own asshole 
 I pray peace on your soul now BEGONE~! 
 Movin on, to deeper brighter better and more 
 Free."

 The mathematic to acting still 
 The unfamiliar the warm embrace 
 The family ties and the stranger's face 
 The lighting thunder the power steed 
 The what it is and the what is believed 
 The strong connections desire to need 
 The waking now or the moment to dream 
 The laugh the murmur the moan and the scream 
 The voice of reason somewhere in between 
 The one and all the me and the we 
 The I and I the thou and the thee 
 A man a design a child of the streets 
 The daily chore the impossible feat 
 The drum the chorus phenomenal beat 
 Easy to touch and the harder to reach 
 The sweetest fruit in the top of the tree 
 The sun the moon the stars and the bree-eze

42,Mos Def,hiphop,Murder Of A Teenage Life,"The murder of a teenage life 
 Fire from the cold steel 
 The heat from the brights 
 The temperature of flesh and the shortness of breath 
 The murder of a teenage threat 
 The aroma of sesamilia Dollar Superstar 
 Skama like a new cocaine tobacco leaf 
 Ecstatic tabernists fire water and freaks 
 The murder of a teenage chief 
 My easy speaking is as easy as it seems to be 
 Hungry belly jamma busts off easily 
 Balloon bang. POP! 
 Hot as a bang spot in Bangkok 
 Colder than a pimp glock 
 Aim shot, the frame drops 
 Pressure pushed him to the earth like a rain drop 
 Take not life in vein 
 And how the preacher was saying 
 Remember! 
 Anyways they laid him in a stray box 
 Dark suit and gray socks 
 The neighborhood is all distraught 
 Candles lit the stoop at the park 
 Where the family and students are 
 Confused, in awe 
 They gape into each others arms 
 It's murder! 
 New absence from a mothers arm 
 Even the warmth from the mother's arms 
 Couldn't keep her son from harm 
 From standing where the gun was drawn 
 Over come, done and done. He's gone... 
 Murder! 
 Shells fell like a bell that rung 
 Blood bursts, body temperature fell and plunged 
 And by the time it took the medics to come 
 The breath eased out of his lungs 
 And his soul eased out of the slums 
 And the voice eased out of the drums 
 The sirens through their ears, they sung 
 Murder! 
 Telephone wire, sneakers hung 
 Murder! 
 For the Black and young 
 Murder! 
 And the Aves they from 
 I am from the block the PRESIDENT DID NOT CAMPAIGN ON 
 Where the dollar that the working poor slave for is made on 
 Where hustlers stretch the yay long 
 And hustle hard for an outpost to trade on 
 Flip it over and make more 
 Where the blocks are yellow taped off 
 Where the young blood is trained on Obese to the Fakesoft 
 Where the pressure just stays on 
 But the lights and the heat don't 
 The place where you witness the true power of street folk 
 And that's where I'm coming from people 
 High post, low key 
 Eighth, o-z, and kilo 
 Law man, dope man 
 Adversary, amigo 
 Preacher man, pimp hand 
 Both folding their C-notes 
 A Black Fist clutching deliverance for the People 
 Young hand reach out, strong hand reach in 
 Slap the devil's hand to make the fucker stop reaching."

 I can't remember being this bored 
 Fake bonanza, there come real wars 
 Bullets burn through the candy on the driver side door 
 Long investigations and no firm lead, billion dollar flow 
 And black life is still cheap 
 Your rent skyrockets and y'all prospects plummet 
 10 murders, 10 days, this summer 
 Talk about today's mathematics, a 8th, an O, a key 
 And the caliber on your rack, shit 
 The inmate number, the centerfolds for measurement 
 Is close as a coed cell come to some tendon-is 
 I heard them say it was All About The Benjamin's 
 I don't believe it now, didn't believe it then, fuck what you heard 
 You believe what you want, the truth is what it is, it be what it been 
 Get rich, shorty just tryin' to live 
 Don't believe in heaven and ain't tryin' to get in 
 And hell is everyday, fuck the world anyway 
 Potion and sips, spark up a clip, FADE AWAY! 
 The low lights, tree top heights 
 Be careful how you move the traps are covered in the lights 
 Landmines be disguised as welcome signs 
 I'll repeat it so you ain't got to press rewind 
 The landmines be disguised as welcome signs 
 Black fresh from Iraq, a wild look in his eyes, missing part of his arm.

 [Verse: Mos Def] 
 Yo, the way I feel, sometime it's too hard to sit still 
 Things are so passionate, times are so real 
 Sometimes I try to chill, mellow down, blowin' smoke 
 Smile on my face but it's really no joke 
 You feel it in the street, the people breathe without hope 
 They going through the motion, they dimming down the focus 
 Their focus get cleared, then their light turn sharp 
 And the eyes grow teary, the mind grow weary 
 I speak it so clearly, sometimes y'all don't hear me 
 I push it past the bass, no nations got to feel me 
 I feel it in my bones, black, I'm so wide awake 
 That I'm hardly ever asleep, my flow forever deep 
 And it's volumes or scriptures when I breathe on the beat 
 My presence speak volumes, before I say a word 
 I'm everywhere penthouse, pavement, and curb 
 Cradle to the grave, tall cathedral of a shell 
 Universal, ghetto life, holla black, you know it well 
 Quiet storm, vital form, pen pushed it right across 
 Mind is a vital force, high level right across 
 Shoulders, the lions raw voice is the siren 
 I swing round, ring out, and bring down the tyrant 
 Shocked a small act, could knock a giant lopsided 
 The world is so dangerous, there's no need for fighting 
 Suttins trying to hide, like the struggle won't find him 
 And the sun bust through the clouds, to clearly remind him 
 He's everywhere: penthouse, pavement, and curb 
 Cradle to the grave, tall cathedral of a shell 
 Universal, ghetto life, holla black, you know it well

 Well say about noonish, coming out the whip 
 And lookin' at me curious, a young Iraqi kid (Awww) 
 Carrying laundry, what's wrong G? Hungry? 
 No, give me my oil, get fuck out my country 
 In an Arabian market, other stuff 
 Till his moms come grab him, and they walk off in a rush 
 Distrust, bitter like I's pissed off on moon 
 I'm like ""Shorty, hope that we can fix our differences soon! Bye!"" 
 Buying apples, I'm breaking 'em

 I don't understand it, on another planet?

 Our green grass is brown. 
 Shots rang my phone wasn't Touch-Tone 
 A heavy beef in the street 
 ET had to flee 
 Great heavens! Good grief! 
 Hungry bellies, bright gold on they teeth! 
 The windows on the Ave look like sad eyes 
 They fix their sharp gaze on you when you pass by 
 And if you dare to stand, you can see 'em cry 
 You can watch 'em scowl, 
 Feel 'em prowl 
 Wall and study every inch about you 
 Fast math measuring what you amount to 
 The laughter, the screams! 
 The numeral, the song of Psalms 
 The book of dreams! 
 Ends don't meet where the arms can't reach 
 Mean streets, 
 Even when its free it ain't cheap. 
 Ongoing saga, terminal diagnosis, 
 Basic survival requires super-heroics. 
 No space in the budget for a cape 
 It's when you gotta fly by night to save the day 
 Crash landings routinely happen 
 Some survive, others never rise from the ashes 
 Watching asphalt and observing the Sabbath 
 Creates an ecstatic and there you have it 
 From teenage love, pray in tongues 
 Strange fruit, batty boots and native drums 
 From hence I come 
 So here we go 
 Signs and wonders all along the road 
 Some lies open, some lies close 
 Some stretchers role with no lies at all. 
 Some riders don't know what they riding for 
 Hands on the wheel and their mind is gone 
 Wherever you ride, whatever your name, 
 This raw cold life is a beautiful thing 
 And we are alive in amazing times 
 Delicate hearts, diabolical minds 
 Revelations, hatred, love and war. 
 And more and more and more and more 
 And more of less than ever before 
 It's just too much more for your mind to absorb 
 It's scary like hell, but there's no doubt 
 We can't be alive in no time but... now! 
 It's just another shot to the heart, 
 It's just a sure shot in the dark, 
 It's just another place in the stars 
 Wonders on every side, life in marvelous times

 Dinner with the patrons, the scenery is amazing 
 It's so outrageous, they whisper when they say it 
 When it's really real it's even realer than the matrix

 Science is a jewel 
 For me and mines, yours and you 
 Let's move 
 Tell you a little about mine, yo 
 I was born in a season where the world was quiet and cold 
 Celebrations were going on 
 Some were happy, some were sad 
 Some felt bad from being good 
 Some felt good from being bad 
 Feelings pass and change, but they never leave 
 They here to stay 
 Holiday, holiday, happy birthday

 Smash when we do shows, facts, no mystery

 I rock with The Roots like the Giving Tree 
 Powerful, bigotry at work, me and my people got history

 Divide it up in parts and sections 
 Days I was ministerin' sectors 
 Direct from the spot, forgotten on your election 
 Jail laced with fragments, speech clipped with accents 
 Phenomenal ave and for future and the past tense 
 Blew up the room in my absence 
 Live or closed caption watch my song vibrate with passion 
 The response in action to light bulb irrations 
 I come from where anything can happen and usually does 
 You find tension where it used to be love 
 I use my words to shine light inside the dark valleys 
 The dark alley, U.K., U.S., New York, Cali 
 From this king to all counties I out loudly 
 The clammer ? the chain of things that surround me 
 And seek bounty or stay stridin' and keep strivin' 
 I seek guidance, like the sun at the dawn I keep risin'

 Packed my things and I moved on (move on, move on)

 Or a mere pot on top ya stove, still ya got to roll 
 Climb my obstacles and honor those who paved the harder road 
 Blazed the trails so a brighter day wasn't far to go 
 So many stories aren't told, so many lights that aren't shone 
 Still the world remain ignorant to what the heart should know 
 My love is audio, transmitted, heard, and felt 
 My words are mirrors to nearer and observe yourself 
 To receive (ceive), reflect (reflect), magnify 
 Let a bright light heal a damaged eye 
 We hold fort like family ties 
 Shout the battle cry and what we challenged by 
 Make the shady stand aside so ? risers can arrive 
 From native to the natural lives you can't deny the natural vibe 
 On a Mayfield natural high, artificials can abide 
 I love to see my masses rise 
 The joy to make your banners hot 
 The stronger people unite the way we lookin' for a brighter day

 I'm not gon sing a song or nothing. 
 Um, what that term they call it post traumatic stress syndrome? That thing that 
 Uh, soldiers will get. I think a lot of people get that. It's like when you 
 Experience somethin' and uh, it affects you for a long time afterwards. I guess 
 Everything works that way. Certain things have more impact than others. 
 Sometimes it visits you in your dreams or when you're quiet or just at peace or 
 Trying to be at peace. A lot of soldiers get it. A lot of common people get 
 It. A lot of the time common people are soldiers, that's just the way it works 
 Out. 
 This is a soldier's dream 
 The other night I was tumbling towards an uneasy sleep 
 When I had discovered myself 
 Atop the sweet sticky firmament of my dreams. 
 Daybreak came and discovered me 
 With my fantasies pasted to my face. 
 I can't look at you right now. 
 ""Show me your eyes,"" she says. 
 ""Later,"" he says. ""Now, now."" ""NO!"" 
 Shame is a prison you know. 
 Yeah, well discretion is a fortress 
 You're starin' and lookin' too closely. 
 There's so much about me that I hide 
 That careful eyes will recognize. 
 If you look closely you'll notice 
 That the pattern on this soft cloth shirt 
 Is made of workin men's sweat 
 And prayin' folk's tears. 
 If you look closer you'll notice 
 That this pattern resembles 
 Tenement row houses, project high rises, 
 Cell block tiers, 
 Discontinued stretches of elevated train tracks, 
 Slave ship gullies, acres of tombstones. 
 If you look closer, you'll notice 
 That this fabric has been carefully blended 
 With an advanced new age polymer (oh man, that's nice) 
 To make the fabric lightweight 
 Weatherproof, and durable. 
 All this to give some sort of posture and dignity 
 To a broken body that is a host for scars. 
 I am the new landmark. I am the museum of injury. 
 Soldiers visit me and admire me quietly, 
 Whispering amongst themselves. You're no soldier. 
 Your soft bright eyes never have to 
 Survey the battlefield, 
 Much less its collected relics of which, I am one. 
 So, my flesh bullet-ridden remains hidden 
 Underneath these soft fabrics 
 Which I carefully select 
 That stand in for how I used to feel, 
 For how I remember feeling, 
 For how I dream about feeling, 
 For how I feel about you. 
 And now your curious fingers want to search 
 Beyond this tender armor. 
 I can't look at you right now 
 (This is my rifle there are many like it but this one is mine) 2x 
 Your eyes are too careful, 
 Collecting it all arranging it all; 
 Surgically, robotically, exactly. 
 I can't look at you right now 
 But that doesn't matter because 
 You can look at me and the longer that 
 I don't return your gaze, 
 The harder that your gaze 
 Starts to run across my back 
 Like a nervous policeman's hands: 
 Brisk, intent, anxious for discovery. 
 If discretion is a fortress 
 Then you're threatening to destroy it 
 By simply standing at the gates 
 And refusing to leave. 
 I can't look at you right now, 
 But you can look at me. Do you see me?"

 They gon' get it! 
 (Rubix) 
 Possessed by a nervous twitch and itchy writin finger 
 41 strokes through the barrel of pen for Amadou 
 More than a few of my personal friends 
 Since the beginning, it seems like it never ends 
 The story, ancient as lyrical allegory and it's all gory 
 The Little Shop of City Hall Horrors 
 Who bakes infiltrate, agent, provocator mission statement 
 Assassinate the Senate candidate, heavenly mandate 
 (Chorus: Mos Def) 
 We proceeded on a country road 
 His mother's eyes withered swoll 
 Her child was never comin' home 
 Said a prayer for his soul 
 As the coffin had closed, committed to the earth below 
 First seed she would sew, would be a tree never grown 
 Shade that was never known 
 Who controls the Terrordome, the member hearts made of stone 
 Who love only what they own 
 (Invincible) 
 Stay on your toes for a true bruise description 
 Match blue suits, walkin' round wit a stick and *edit* 
 Ready to blast wit the wrath of a hollow tip 
 And the fact is my task is a scholarship 
 I feel it in my chest cavitity 
 The only death's apathy, so I change it for who's next after me 
 And that's the fullest reward 
 Keep the face of the lost on my bulletin board 
 (Wordsworth) 
 Yo yo, it's blue uniform, sirens, names, and badge numbers 
 Clubs, walkie-talkies, recipies for bad summers 
 Frisked, pissed after I tuck in my stuff 
 I really think they just like touchin my *nuts* 
 What's real stain they thoughts 
 Swear, but they won't say it in court 
 All they do is change the report 
 Riots, tryin' to keep the crowd under control 
 They even got shows, Cops, LAPD, Highway Patrol yo yo 
 (A.L.) 
 From the cradle to the grave, they made you a slave 
 Brainwash to kill each other, that's the plague that they made 
 I search 'em like readin scripts that could save you today 
 White is right, black is wrong, that's the label they gave 
 Fryin in hell, applyin jails, they got you dyin' in cells 
 Triple six in the mix, Levine to ?spell? 
 Prepare for the worst, and try to hope for the best 
 I take a stare at the hearse, can we cope wit the stress? 
 (Kofi Taha) 
 I live in the land of punches 
 Illegal chokeholds and excessive gunshots 
 Where there's one millionaire for every billion empty pot 
 And Adolf Guily think we static but he's in for a shock 
 They come wit automatics but we flip it 
 Use the one, create the four glocks and while stocks get washed 
 While school doors get locked and when jobs get blocked 
 The confi-dence get's rock 
 And when the welfares drop into the jails we stock now 
 After Amadou wrestlin wit freedom tacks my mind into a headlock 
 But *fuck* H&R, I'm a true cat 
 Refundin power back to our Blocks 
 (Tame One) 
 Good life, you can bubble or struggle 
 Use your brain muscle if you hustle 
 Don't let nobody touch you 
 Don't even trust the ones that trust you 
 'Cause the ones you showin love to might bust 
 Seekin' as a cancer, my man got shot by Haitians or Jamaicans 
 ? Wit confrontations and school my mind's racin 
 I pride these sensations over this, now I'm hopin this 
 We shine for, I never got a chance to rhyme for 
 My role models sold bottles and stole cars 
 And when they got locked, I accepted all the phone calls 
 That's when *niggas* was real 
 Back before I had a deal 
 Back when people called Villsburg Hooterville 
 ILL! 
 (Jane Doe) 
 My mind wonders on melodic jams 
 An exotic bird, caged wit the rage and the violence of my words 
 The same things I down I turn around and do 
 The white cops say *Fuck you* but I say *Fuck you too!* 
 Truth be totally hypocrites 
 And materialistic society, spirituality shunned or 
 While young kinds get gunned on 
 Hibernatin in projects, which you project-ing 
 The pigs is crucifyin but Africans is resurrectin, Jane Doe 
 (Grafh) 
 Battacky, sends cops to come and catch me 
 He better send a runnin' back to run and track me 
 When I'm runnin' through the back streets 
 The rat teeth of beast lovin' to black me 
 Eatin brothers like a picinic color 'cause that's sweet 
 To lock a man up in prison, the standard of livin' 
 Thinkin' they make a better bred of man 
 Than the man when he went in 
 Rub up a man for sinnin 
 Handcuff his hands to the system, banned from his wisdom 
 Wit insanity in him, his mind roams wit like a cyclone 
 Damagin victim, his eyes hold savage within him 
 Wrath wit the venom, poison his life 
 No ointment to boisten the might 
 If it's on the left, walk to the right 
 Until death, do your part do your life 
 Like a boyfriend and wife, because the day times shorter than night 
 You know?

 To deal with my conditional mentally and physical 
 Strength is indivisible, crews be comin' pitiful

 Tellin' you or what magic beans they sellin' you

 You can collect your little petty cash advance HOE

 I'm foul, plus I'm winnin', you think I shot the ref?

 I'm back these rap cats is wildin' 
 Got 'em in the studio poppin' Valiums, remasterin' they album 
 I'm about to re-up and restructure the case 
 You stuck, you about to get rearranged and replaced 
 I got plans for this rap game (uh-huh) 
 Put your head in the toilet and look son, 
 If you think my shit done changed 
 My shit is, out of your range, rip you out of your frame 
 Cop your tape, and the next day, copped an exchange 
 If you ain't, rockin' raw, what you rockin' for?? 
 Without heat, y'all MC's, ain't hot no more 
 So for you lame cats tryin' to put your hit out 
 Try rockin' back and forth 
 It might be easier to get your shit out! 
 I'm Jedi Master, Mase Windu, what you been through 
 Keep MC's heads wrapped like Erykah Ba-do 
 Hip-Hop's Cleon Jones, when Eon Jones 
 Wackest MC's, we pee on those 
 No need to impede The High and Mighty mystique 
 That shit would be as ignorant as Jimmy the Greek 
 Claimin' they Godzilla's when they really Godzooki 
 Got a mill' from Charlie Brown, when I kidnapped Snoopy 
 Eon, sale or performance, in any ordinance 
 Rhyme menace, that burst your verbal nuisance 
 In accordance, with all the laws from the cordless 
 Starbuck coming through, leavin' any pimp whoreless

 I dreamt that I could paint you in words 
 But there were no colors, bright enough 
 Black or white enough 
 Blue or green enough 
 It didn't mean enough 
 You are the star to touch the earth 
 Shine bright for all eyes to see, 
 Radiate and touch me 
 Now I'm shining like you do 
 It was dim before I knew you 
 Bright light for weeping eyes to get used to 
 Trust who? that's some shit I had to adjust to 
 Soon as you relax they ease back and cold bust you 
 Love murdered in brooklyn, sound the alarm 
 But you still remain calm 
 My passion is unarmed 
 I try to practice my warlike tactics 
 But in your clutch, in your touch 
 My armor, just collapses 
 Such bliss breeds obliviousness 
 I recollect sweet breath still wet on my lips 
 My prayers this: 
 God protect my beloved 
 And keep her covered 
 From the valley to the summit 
 Like the land undiscovered 
 Like the stars outnumbered, you are so beautiful. 
 Background singers [Kweli and Mos Def]

 On my feet

 Come to me 
 (From a distant land understand who I am) 
 Down again, we can wash it over me.] 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 You know what! 
 They say that beauty's in the eye of the beholder 
 So I use my third, and now our love is solid like a boulder 
 Wanna build with you as I get older, and that's my word 
 Sure as I stand on my ancestor's shoulders 
 You see through my drama and my world like a stage 
 Not the same years but livin' in the same age 
 It's the Kwelity not the quantity 
 Follow me 
 Def-in-ate-ly, 
 Far from probably."
68,Mos Def,hiphop,Beef,"Yo I was sold to a sick European by a rich African battlin' 
 Middle Passages, I can't go back again 
 Battlin' years of denyin' history, lies and mysteries 
 Wives with misty eyes watchin' their niggas be beaten viciously 
 Battle in the wilderness of North America 
 Ran by the river, only stoppin' to pray 
 Chased by predators 
 Terrorists with etiquette who vote and kill their president 
 Their capacity for evil so evident and prevalent 
 Ain't no hesitation involved, a nation dissolved 
 While we sit back waitin' to evolve 
 Those who would trade in their freedom 
 For their protection deserve neither 
 Fuck a name, fuck tradition

 Turn the other cheek 
 Inherit the Earth, just stay meek

 Beef is not what Jay said to Nas 
 Beef is when workin' niggas can't find jobs 
 So they tryna find niggas to rob 
 Tryna find bigger guns so they can finish the job 
 Beef is when the crack kids can't find moms 
 'Cause they end up inna pine box or locked behind bars 
 Beef ain't the Summer Jam for Hot 97 
 Beef is the cocaine and AIDS epidemic 
 Beef don't come with a radio edit 
 Beef is when the judge is callin' you ""defendant"" 
 Beef, it comes with a long jail sentence 
 Handed down to you in a few short minutes 
 Beef is when your girl come through for a visit 
 Talkin' bout ""I'm pregnant by some other nigga"" 
 Beef is high blood pressure and bad credit 
 Need a loan for your home and you're too broke to get it 
 And all your little kids is doin' is gettin' bigger 
 You tryin' not to raise 'em around these wild niggas 
 Beef is when a gold digger got ya seat and a 
 A manicured hand out like ""pay me nigga"" 
 Or I'm tellin' your wife 
 Or startin' up some foul rumor that'll ruin your life 
 Beef is when a gangster ain't doin' it right 
 Another gangster then decided what to do with his life 
 Beef is not what these famous niggas do on the mic 
 Beef is what George Bush would do in a fight 
 Yeah, beef is not what Ja said to 50 
 Beef is more than Irv not bein' here with me 
 When a soldier ends his life with his own gun 
 Beef is tryin' to figure out what to tell his son 
 Beef is oil prices and geopolitics 
 Beef is Iraq, the West Bank, and Gaza Strip 
 Some beef is big and some beef is small 
 But what y'all call beef is not beef at all 
 Beef is real life happenin' everyday

 Good evening ladies and gents, close and distant fam 
 Let me break it down for y'all exactly who I am...(CAV) 
 That brotha straight off of Myrtle Ave 
 That dude that make the other dude say that's my man, (CAV) 
 It ain't nuttin' I want I can't have 
 The haters know it's real and that's why they mad 
 They struggle so hard while I just lay back 
 They sound under pressure, sweaty and straight wack 
 I rock like this because I ain't that, (CAV) 
 Tell the players I'm taking the game back... 
 Matta fact tell the coaches, the GMs, and owners 
 Shut down the stadiums, it's ova 
 I make the cat's in the back draw closer 
 Get the comp choked up like white folks on Oprah 
 Yeah you dope, but (CAV) is more doper 
 Mo skill, mo style than mo folkas 
 I hit the lab with good shit to smoke up 
 And tell the sound man where I wanna go from 
 Blow up, skit sheet across the notepad 
 School em' all from the drop out to post grads 
 What history book you do or don't have 
 There's only two eras of rap, pre and post CAV 
 Now you know that 
 Stop the train, there's no place for the game left to go at 
 (Break) 
 CAV is my name but you can call me, (CAV) 
 It's all the same abbreviated or whole 
 Shout it out so it don't be a secret to folk it go, (CAV) 
 Short for Cavee but I'm not from Cali 
 I'm from the rotten apple, dirty streets and alleys 
 Bed-Stuy Brooklyn doin'it exactly, Get at me! 
 (2nd Verse) 
 Holla!...Like Missy and Ja Rule 
 Ain't a crowd in the world that CAV cannot move 
 Hot dude, cats was thinkin' it's not true 
 But come front row at show, I got proof 
 I went from sellin' candy in junior high school 
 To servin' spoony g for the fiends, to gnaw to 
 Got sent upstate on bus, (Not cool) 
 In the yard thinkin' damn should've listen to ma duke 
 Come home in 99, what the fuck I'm gonna do 
 I won't move bundles, I got a new hustle 
 I quit pie baking, started rhyme makin' 
 Buildin' up my rep to be one of the five greatest 
 And I ain't saying CAV the best nigga out there 
 But until he appear, I'm sittin'in his chair 
 And I'ma need a few moments just to get in y'all ear 
 To make you forget the Duke was eva even here 
 I got two words for the world, BE PREPARED! 
 I got three words for your girl, DON'T BE SCARED! 
 And when they ask where the real hip-hop, IT'S OVA HERE! 
 And when they ask where Brooklyn at, HOLD YA EAR!

 To the black consciousness movement of the 1930s 
 And now when we speak about complexion 
 We move into (???) of where y'all comin' from 
 Yeah, red boned, variety covered

 As is requested on the record my speech is live, devised or nothin' 
 Fortified the weapon, the best was selected 
 You ain't the mos def you the mos defective 
 Bounce and keep steppin' 
 My inkwell is a riverbed that resurrect the living dead 
 I manifest what's considered but what isn't said 
 Stay on the dot like a infrared 
 It's off the block with whole different thread 
 The durable, flame-resistant, breathable, fantastic fabric 
 You all get into your formal wear, weave classics 
 My speech fits so seamless ya need glasses 
 To recognize the stitch on your nerve fiber 
 The Black Star gon' make the whole world turn brighter 
 You shine bright but my constellation burn brighter 
 They ain't invited to the table, make it turn cipher 
 They chattin' big words but backs is yellow like Big Bird 
 When I flow you ain't seein' no dough like interns 
 I'm professor, you a freshman just scared of your midterms 
 The title on my bookbinding is ""Advanced Mic Science"" 
 A champion can only rest at the place where the title is 
 Brooklyn

 ""And I'm Crooklyn's finest, Crooklyn's finest"" -> Notorious B.I.G. 
 Believe that 
 Brooklyn my habitat 
 The place where it happen at 
 Lives sway in the sharp balance of the battle-ax 
 Irons is brandished at 
 Thugs draw their hammer back 
 It's where you find the News 2 crew cameras at 
 It's where my fam is at, the Summertime Jam is at 
 They play B.I.G. and get you open like a sandleback 
 Hotter than candle wax 
 Hustle and you can't relax 
 The crack babies tryin' to find where their mammas at 
 It's off the handle, black 
 Where big police scandals at 
 Turned in to action screenplay sold to Miramax 
 The type of place where they check your appearance at 
 And cats who know where all the hot low gear is at 
 The stompin' grounds is where you find the pound smokers that 
 Be blazin' tron that have your wave cap floatin' back 
 The doorstep where the ""Dispossessed"" posted at 
 Dope fiends out on Franklin Ave. sellin' Zorarax 
 You big ballin' better keep your money folded back 
 'Cause once the young guns notice that, it's over black 
 Brooklyn keep on takin' it, worldwide we known for that 
 Flossy cats get it snatched like the local tax 
 The place I sharpen up my baritone vocals at 
 Where one of the greatest MCs was a local cat 
 {*Beat switches*} 
 Uh huh yeah 
 I keep it rockin' 
 Classic like Adidas Top 10s 
 I'm free from all feelings and toxins 
 Mysterious like chessboxin' 
 Roll with the force to stop gents 
 From mixin' up their wicked concoctions 
 Kweli, that's my (???) and thought is our department 
 If you can't clean up, don't start then 
 My print on the parchment translate finer and larger 
 To leave the competition disheartened 
 The stars shine black like carbon 
 Writin' in my book of rhymes, all my words pass the margin 
 To hold a mic I'm throbbin' 
 I carry off the page 
 Go on and on for days 
 So my phrase autographed on the breeze you breathe 
 Inhale the crisp air of the brand new seas 
 Where we run things but things don't run we 
 What you hear from me constructed carefully 
 Walk until my brothers on the run so fearfully 
 Passionate to the point of tearful 
 They be like ""Mos I FEEL YOU"" 
 Holdin' it down and still DO 
 FO' REAL DUDE, I'm real true 
 Radiate whatever I'm far from or near to 
 Stay electric like eels who preside in the ocean tide 
 Better tell the clothesline time to open wide, and RECIEVE this 
 No trick, son we sleeveless 
 So nice you can either recite or read this 
 My semantic's deep like Atlantis secrets 
 Who you got beef with? Then STATE your grievance 
 MAKE IT KNOWN before my defense make a zone 
 Make peace 'fore you find it too hard to make it home 
 Vocal cords so powerful they might break a bone 
 We rollin' with the natives, regulate the Terrordome 
 Bout to enter to the ages where my crew take the throne 
 My DNA is out of print, you can't make a clone 
 So rockin' it, keep rockin' it 
 A hundred percent ""B-Boy Document"" 
 Magnetic marvelous, astonishin' accomplishments like consciousness 
 Whether solo or partnership I dominate the conferences 
 Can't say that twice, but you ain't that nice

83,Mos Def,hiphop,Corners,"Memories on corners with the fours and the moors [pronounced foes and moes] 
 Walk to the store for the rose talking straightforward to 
 Got uncles that smoke it some put blow up they nose 
 To cope with they lows the wind is cold and it blows 
 In they socks and they souls holding they rolls 
 Corners leave souls opened and closed hoping for more 
 With nowhere to go rolling in droves 
 They shoot the wrong way 'cause they ain't knowing they goal 
 The streets ain't safe 'cause they ain't knowing he code 
 By the fours I was told either focus or fold 
 Got cousins with flows hope they open some doors 
 So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls 
 Now I roll in a ""Olds"" with windows that don't roll 
 Down the roads where cars get broke in and stole 
 These are the stories told by Stony and Cottage Grove 
 The world is cold the block is hot as a stove 
 On the corners 
 I wish I could give ya this feeling 
 I wish I could give ya this feeling 
 On the corners, niggas robbing, killing, dying 
 Just to make a living (huh) 
 We underrated, we educated 
 The corner was our time when times stood still 
 And gators and snakes gangs and yellow and pink 
 And colored blue profiles glorifying that 
 Streetlights and deepnights cats trying to eat right 
 Riding no seat bikes with work to feed hypes 
 So they can keep sweet Nikes they head and they feet right 
 Desires of streetlife cars and weed types 
 It's hard to breath nights days are thief like 
 The beast roam the streets the police is Greeklike 
 Game at it's peak we speak and believe hype 
 Bang in the streets hats cocked left or deep right 
 Its steep life coming up where sheeplike 
 Rappers and hoopers we strive to be like 
 G's with 3 stripes seeds that need light 
 Cheese and weaves tight needs and thieves strike 
 The corner where struggle and greed fight 
 We write songs about wrong 'cause it's hard to see right 
 Look to the sky hoping it will bleed light 
 Reality's and I heard that she bites 
 The corner 
 The corner was our magic, our music, our politics 
 Fires raised as tribal dancers and 
 War cries that broke out on different corners 
 Power to the people, black power, black is beautiful 
 Black church services, murderers, Arabs serving burger its 
 Cats with gold permanents move they bags as herbalist 
 The dirt isn't just fertile its people working and earning this 
 The curb-getters go where the cash flow and the current is 
 It's so hot that burn to live the furnace is 
 Where the money move and the determined live 
 We talk play lotto and buy German beers 
 It's so black packed with action that's affirmative 
 The corners 
 The corner was our Rock of Gibraltar, our Stonehenge 
 Our Taj Mahal, our monument, 
 Our testimonial to freedom, to peace and to love 
 Down on the corner"

 Makin' these MC's our sons like Horus

 Absorb the sonic energy manifestin through your monitor

 Simply because it's coming straight out of Brooklyn 
 It sounds so out of sight I got the blind people lookin' 
 It's Mr. Man the act, boy what? You get stolen 
 I'll cut your ass in half and leave you with a semicolon 
 (Kweli) 
 We cold-crushin MC's that's gold-rushin for the cheese 
 They see a flash in the pan waitin for royalties 
 (Mos Def) 
 But kings and queens get overthrown when they grab the microphone 
 Shootin videos in homes that they know they'll never own 
 I guess they cannot work alone, they forever with crew 
 L sparking, steady barking 'bout the wildness they do 
 Posin in photographs shot at complimentary angles 
 Be playin' Mr. Tuffy when they feminine like bangles 
 Practices is fraudulent, fallacies record to tape 
 Step in my zone, your spot'll get blown like Watergate 
 (Mr. Man) 
 Wait, my blastin rate is past a state of rappers who procrastinate 
 Mr. Man is great, so every time I rhyme, I fascinate 
 Masses hate to have to wait for me to unload 
 So I flip into my mode of rhyme, long like a road 
 See, I drop the greats like clumsy waiters drop plates 
 I got rhymes by the crates to erase the duplicates 
 Cause, I blow wack rappers out like afros 
 My shit is so phat it be stretchin my asshole 
 But huh, that's not the point because I'm better than most 
 I make MC's Wonder like bread but then, bread gets toast 
 It's like that, Mr. Man, Mos Def, and Kweli 
 Represent for every single real MC, you don't stop 
 (Yo, yo, yo, this is the mighty Mos Def)"

 It's the Stuy, it's the Bush, dem niggaz again 
 Ta' Kweli, Mighty Def, and that's 'sta on the guest lock 
 Kanye, you're the dope man in hip hop, now let's rock 
 Now roll out niggaz, my hometown niggaz 
 I get it good in your hood so slow down niggaz 
 Watch the speed though, man, you better let ease off 
 A street talk into a collision course with these walls - bam! 
 They don't move, don't pray, don't lose, don't sleep 
 Light passin', light fashion, light pappers that pass part a gun 
 Black hands up ?? 
 Black guns up ?? 
 Dyin' wish is to touch the air 
 Seekin' heaven that wasn't here 
 Eyes will not see another year 
 It's another day 
 It's the same fight 
 Dip around, sound the bell 
 Mix it up and ?? where you live it up the beat 
 And get risen up you're knocked down get it back and get it up 
 Get off of queer street and get with us 
 And get clear where we did it 
 From the heart, from the people 
 From the top, from the jeep 
 From the gut, from the street 
 From my soul to the mic to the essence 
 Say in my absence you feel the presence, exactly 
 I make contact with shorter emcee 
 Me and mine we don't just get by 
 We get free and that's ready [Mos -- nigga] 
 (Jay-Z) 
 Just to get by 
 Nigga I sold coke, nigga I pushed lah 
 Carried a fo'five 
 Claimed I was ready to die 
 Promised never to cry 
 Held it all inside 
 Reality was too much to take so I 
 Kept my mind fry 
 Slimmed for most of mine 
 Soon as I closed my eyes 
 Then I woke up behind 
 Nigga either I load up these nines 
 Or blow up with rhymes 
 Cause this flow of mine is like blow up but lines of coca 
 And your folks think Hov' just wrote stuff to rhyme 
 Nah, I'm a poster for what happened seein your moms 
 Doin' five dollars worth to work just to get a dime 
 So pardon my disposition 
 Why should I listen to a system that never listened to me? 
 Picture me working McDonald's 
 I'd rather pull a mac on you 
 Sorry Ms. Jackson but I'm packin 
 (Kanye West) 
 It's on I'm packin weight like nina simone 
 Piano flow 
 It's like a Michaelangelo paintin' a portrait of Maya Angelou 
 And gave it to a sick poet for they antidote 
 If music get's you choked up this is the treat anaerobe 
 This is shy nigga I mista all of that 
 Fuck a mattress, put this bitch on the almanac 
 Dice what they hittin' for, 'lax what you sittin' on 
 Tracks who you spittin' on, rap till we get it on 
 And don't let nobody with the power to sign 
 Ever tell you you ain't got the power to rhyme 
 They used to tell me toughen up 
 Put some bass in your voice 
 They used to tell me lighten up 
 Put some mase in your voice 
 Lord willin' I ain't kill nobody 
 But I have a feelin' this album 
 That I'm gonna make a killin' 
 Well now that's chillin' 
 This is love it or hate it music 
 But, at least we made it music 
 And we didn't make it industry 
 This is gon' be interesting 
 This'll be the end of me or I'm ??? on be an entity 
 Kanye, Jay-Z, Mos Def, and Kweli 
 We are not makin' songs no more 
 We're makin' history 
 (Background singers) 
 This morning I woke up 
 Feelin' brand new, I jumped up 
 Feelin' my highs and my lows 
 In my soul, and my goals 
 Just to stop smoking and stop drinkin' 
 But I been thinkin' I got my reasons 
 Just to get (by), just to get (by) 
 Just to get (by), just to get (by)

 (Talib Kweli) 
 Just to get by, just to get by 
 Just to get by 
 We keep it gangsta, stay 'fo shizzle', 'fo sheezy' 
 To set the tide to the violence on the TV during the war 
 Killin' each other is easy, there's war and liquor for fallen niggaz Believe 
 Me, it's ghetto love, I bet you seen it all befo' 
 Just to get by, my people we get fly 
 My people we get high, fillin cigars with the lah 
 Nigga come on, even Jesus was stoned before receivin' the throne 
 I said to rest in peace to Nina Simone 
 (Busta Rhymes) 
 Back in the days we was used to doin' the shit 
 I can't call it all in the streets 
 We was hustlin fiends that asked for it 
 I guess I was used to just standin on corners 
 Waitin for paper bags with bundles of crack 
 Hopin the week was good so I could get money back 
 To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by 
 When I was stressed I possessed a side of my strength 
 That made me angry and bleed 
 With the frustration havin' me smokin' Newports and weed 
 To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by 
 Those be the times when I try to rely 
 On my niggaz and street motherfuckers 
 And reach out to wifey and then I place a call on my mother 
 To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by 
 (Hey yo mom pick up the phone, I g- I gotta to talk to you ma) 
 If you was five percent instead of actin' stupid and guessin 
 You had to go and study your lessons 
 And know your math in the building recession to get by 
 (Hook: Talib Kweli + background singers) 
 This morning I woke up 
 Feelin' brand new, I jumped up 
 Feelin' my highs and my lows 
 In my soul, and my goals 
 Just to stop smoking and stop drinkin' 
 But I been thinkin' I got my reasons 
 Just to get (by), just to get (by) 
 Just to get (by), just to get (get buh buh buh bye bye) 
 (Background singers repeat in the background) 
 Bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah dah 
 Bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah daaah 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 Some people try 
 Some people try just to get by 
 For my piece of the pie 
 You love to eat and be high 
 We deceive and we lie 
 And we keepin' it fly - yo yo yo yo yo 
 People ??? 
 Keeper of the skies 
 Can't see your eyes 
 See the evil inside 
 The best people you find 
 Stronger people in mind 
 I stay readin' the signs

 Feel the pain of my rain when I snatch the sun out your sky 
 Thinkin' you fly, signin contracts with the devil, bust guys iller 
 We flatten your town like Godzilla 
 Whether guilt is a skrilla, Franks or banks, five pence or ten cents 
 Whatever the currency we currently intense like great sex 
 You make bets before you gamble your life away

 Crumble up rookies like cookies 
 Lest why'all can deal with them bookies 
 Aww sooky sooky, now looky looky here 
 Yo you softer than pink cashmere

 I flow clear like Evian, tap on that ass like Savion 
 My style's way beyond the average rhyme savage 
 The shit that they be on, it ain't doin' no damage 
 If lyrical skills is food then them niggaz is famished 
 They can't manage so their shit is poorly represented 
 Necessity's the mother of everything that's embedded 
 I came up with the style to see right through your smile 
 My rhyme is true and leave you kinda blue like Miles 
 Pick my gun up and run up on you just like the river Nile 
 Bringin' life to the mic like midwives deliver child 
 Now the stakes is high so I'ma take you there 
 That beef will get you all bloody 'cause your steaks is rare

 Curse on your whole dance squadron

 Yo, talk about paying the ultimate price 
 Hurricane been incarcerated all of his life 
 Started out at like twelve 
 Trapped in a belly of hell 
 Grew into a man inside of a cell 
 Yo, anger just swell up 
 At a early age that develop 
 Hot head and now it ain't shit y'all could tell him 
 They said he's on a road to become a felon 
 But instead he swung blows that'll spilt your melon 
 He did his thing and was the king of the ring, undisputed 
 Started making noise but they tried to mute it 
 They put him through it 
 For him to make the system look stupid, (yo) 
 They rather look you in the face and shoot it 
 And leave your spot looted (or what) 
 Or leave your whole life blank futured and caught 
 When you scream at it and do it 
 With sweat leaking from the outline of your silhouette 
 Don't understand the point that you at 
 Or how the hell you came to it? 
 Flashback to images of that night, out in patterson 
 They pulled him over heading home from a gathering 
 And when they told him the charge it kind of baffled him 
 Murder in the first for the champ, we on that again?

 Could you hold it together?

 Forever, imagine your locked down forever 
 Could y'all stand the weather? 
 You built for that weather? 
 Yo, know what'm saying? 
 Know what'm saying? 
 (Common) 
 You gotta fight for what you believe in 
 Nobody knows the troubles seen 
 This flick left me wondering 
 'What can become of kings and young kids? ' 
 Summer dream deferred, incident occurred, freedom blurred 
 A freedom that would only be retrieved again in words, later on 
 The cops, y'all know what they be on 
 A nigga's life is like a field that they play upon, away and gone from 
 Natural lifer, a soul he had to fight, 
 Learn it himself, sleep days, stay up half the night 
 Amongst dead man walking, he got afterlife exercising, 
 Developing his knack to write 
 Never leaving his cell, in this world he trapped himself 
 What he loved on the outside world, detached himself 
 You know the cards blacks get dealt by the system 
 He drew a picture of freedom with many dimensions 
 This picture proved to be bigger than black and white 
 A young soul named lesra brought him back to life 
 It's amazing to a man what a book could do 
 And how certain books seem to look for you 
 This is the story of a champion's fall and rise 
 The story left me wiping my eyes

 For wealth or settlement, I move forward (who you?)

 God placed it in a man on the day he was born 
 Convicted minutes after, a true natural disaster 
 Framed for manslaughter, the hurricane carter rising 
 From out the south water, like torrential rains 
 In the ring no opponent escaped unscathed 
 You can't believe the world we live in's injust 
 All I see is more proof, there's no place for us 
 They had my man carter locked in a cage, like an animal 
 Drive him to the point where the mind work mechanical 
 Or works by remote control 
 It was done to all of us, they tapped directly into our soul 
 Either it's sing-sing, or it's bars around your mind 
 There's no where to run, no where to hide 
 In a six-by-six a guilty man cries 
 For repentance and lost is what innocence is

 Accuse a hurricane 
 Ain't change a damned shame 
 It's life for hurricane, hurricane 
 (Black thought) 
 *Overtop of sung chorus* 
 Your locked down forever 
 Could you stand the weather? 
 Could you hold it together? 
 I can't even explain the pain, know'm saying? 
 Your life was like a hurricane, a hurricane 
 Forever, imagine behind bars forever 
 Could you stand the weather? 
 You built for that? is you cut for that? 
 Don't be telling me that you know the pain 
 Your life was like a hurricane, yo

93,Mos Def,hiphop,I've Committed Murder,"My baby works down at the boulevard café 
 Just a fine young man with big dreams 
 Trying to make his own way 
 The owner is this man ole bitch who degrades 
 Him everyday 
 Then she fires him for no reason 
 Don't wanna give him for no reason 
 I've committed murder and I think I got away 
 I'm hiding at my mother's house come get me right away 
 Right away 
 I have no intention of paying for my crimes don't fear 
 We're gonna get the next plane outta here and fly away 
 Fly away 
 When he's down it breaks my heart to see him 
 So I figured I'd talk to her woman to woman 
 I walk in and she's countin' her cash 
 Got so much cash her office looks like a green pasture 
 I said, ""Give him the little bit of money you owe him"" 
 She said ""Get back bitch I ain't givin' you shit"" 
 I said, ""You ole bag, maybe you ain't heard but them are fightin words"" 
 I've committed murder and I think I got away 
 I'm hiding at my mother's house come get me right away 
 Right away 
 I have no intention of paying for my crimes don't fear 
 We're gonna get the next plane outer here and fly away 
 Fly away 
 And I don't feel bad about it 
 See baby there was this struggle 
 And I don't feel bad about it 
 As a result of our struggle 
 And I don't feel bad about it 
 But the good thing is 
 And I don't feel bad about it 
 We don't have to struggle no more 
 With a suitcase full of money 
 We flew to a Jamaican paradise 
 One thing I've learned through all of this is 
 Having money sure is nice 
 Me and my baby got married 
 He's working hard to make his dreams came true 
 As far as regrets I don't have any 
 Would you? 
 I've committed murder and I think I got away 
 I'm hiding at my mother's house come get me right away 
 Right away 
 I have no intention of paying for my crimes don't fear 
 We're gonna get the next plane outer here and fly away 
 Fly away"

 Slicker than a porpoise and thicker than a horse's 
 Carmen Brown got the whole town speechless 
 I stick to my thesis, I stick to my features

 Mos def, blessed with the breath of life so arise and give praises 
 Turn my face to where the mighty sun raises 
 My book of rhyme pages, filled with phrases that amaze 
 I could go on for days 
 First name dante, last name beze 
 Build the house of tomorrow with bricks of today 
 My foundation rests on allah corner stone 
 Shine the light throught the mic to radiate your zone 
 See, the world that we know is about to get finished 
 I'm watching last days wind down to final minutes 
 Got dreams of paradise and my whole fam in it 
 So I ain't got time to play no crime lieutenant 
 Do you got time to play the crime lieutenant? 
 See time is the asset, how you gonna spend it 
 The way you handle yours will be well documented 
 It's the raw authentic, sandalwood scented 
 To make you bump the joint and in beyond city limits 
 Twenty-first, no time to, approach a thing timid

 Approach the ceremony authentic, never phony 
 For delf, but never lonely, keep the kinfolk close 
 Watch me rip it on pacific and atlantic coasts 
 With the antidote, for the poisonous snake lies wit 
 Only wimps put the hiss on tape 
 You can't get on straight, this is dead on tape 
 Accompanied by shawn j. with the bid on bait 
 Put the grid on plate, on the ear or tray 
 Hot damn it captain kirk and the klingons say 
 You can't sit on stage, you got to get on the m-o- 
 T-i-v-a-t-e real life, ain't no freebie 
 My seed can't be needy, no time for freaky-deaky 
 I'm movin on up like george and wheezy 
 Who said that this was easy, they must have been treetop high 
 Standin yieldin to our boldfaced lie, we all got to die 
 So all got to try, to live life right 
 In the sight of most high, to live life right 
 In the sight of most high, to live life right

 Before fiberglass 
 Before parquet 
 Before the word ""Doctor"" was spelled with a ""J"" 
 And ballrooms were ballcourts where the Renaissance played 
 Before the hype and before the dunk

 Before the money and before the fame 
 Before new school and old school 
 Before school had a name 
 It was only a ball and the soul of the game

 To all my people in the front jam on it {ha ha, ha ha} 
 To all my people on the side jam on it {he he, he he, right} 
 So jam on it, say what 
 (Mos Def) 
 The sweet old beats my speech radiates 
 I grab the mic my voice resonates and penetrates 
 I make the 'B-Boy' emulate 
 A buck-fifty still swinging like a heavyweight 
 Me and the lounge about to levitate 
 You don't believe let me demonstrate 
 The way we make cats disintegrate 
 (Cosmo) 
 Well hold up you got to stop the tape 
 You got to prove you can rock the break 
 Me and my man going to investigate 
 The whole way that you operate, cooperate 
 And what's your name? {Mos Def} 
 And where you from? {Brooklyn} 
 And how you living {Very well, very well} 
 Damn you had to say it twice? {That's right} 
 So you nice? {Damn right} 
 (Mos Def) 
 I rock the party all night all night 
 {All right, all right} 
 So why you over here riffing with me? 
 Trying to prove your position to me? 
 {Some cats ain't equipped to MC} 
 But you can see I'm different 'G' 
 The universal magnificently 
 I rock the party efficiently 
 From the Brooklyn vicinit-y 
 And I do it so lyrically 
 That you got to give it to me 
 Like Rick James, I kick game and spit flames 
 Burning rappers all up out their frame 
 We get into this vein 
 From Brownsville all the way down to Brisbane 
 {Damn this brother's flow is insane} 
 That's what I've been trying to explain 
 Got no time to play games 
 Keep it coming like the next train 
 Make the party people exclaim 
 Whenever they hear my name 
 They go 'Mos Def' 
 Oh yes my style is so fresh 
 Guaranteed to win any MC contest 
 Old school like the '84 fresh fest 
 You spend your assets to get my cassette 
 Now that's fresh, the red hook address 
 Make the comp jeal and swell like abscess 
 I'm shoutin' big love to Medina and the rest 
 Bout' to drop it on your block the hot on the press 
 (Chorus with singing in background) 
 I said people in the front jam on it {Say what, say what} 
 To all my people in the back jam on it {Say what, say what} 
 To all my people on the side jam on it {Ha ha, ha ha} 
 Jam on it, Ha ha, ha ha 
 To all my people in the front jam on it 
 To all my people in the back jam on it 
 To all my people on the side jam on it 
 So jam on it, ha ha, ha ha

 You see my name is Mos Def and my style will never pest 
 Brown skinned body-rocking MC 
 I got the black zodiac and you know it's never whack 
 Sagitarius definitley 
 You see it's me and lyricist and we're getting serious about to 
 Make another hit 
 I tell your homeboy chill 'cause his style ain't ill but it's 
 Straight up counterfeit 
 You see I'm faster then a speeding bullet and when I'm on 
 The set 
 All the hip-hop fans just raise they hands 'cause I'm the one and 
 Only mighty Mos Def 
 You see I come into the party in a 'B-Boy' stance I rock the mic 
 So viciously 
 So all the real 'B-boys' and real 'B-Girls' know it's no other 
 Better than me

 I said hey Mos Def you can't steal the show 
 You ain't the only MC out here with flow 
 I'm the Pro Cosmo and I'm letting you know 
 That I get on the mic and go toe to toe 
 (Mos Def) 
 Well cool down young brother just slow your roll 
 'Cause your arm's to shook to have mic control 
 See I get on the mic and jump on your case 
 You best get out my face and stay in a child's place 
 (Cosmo) 
 See I get on the mic because I know I can 
 And I'm fresher than you because I know I am 
 So when I jump on the stage you better step back 
 'Cause your name is Mos Def but your really Mos Whack 
 (Mos Def) 
 Uh listen up little brother you ain't grown 
 The sun is going down you need to take your butt home 
 You come outside with your whack freestylin' 
 Should have kept it 'In the House' like Debbie Allen 
 When I grab the microphone people scream my name 
 The ain't no Sesame Street this is a grown-man's lane 
 See you best heed my words and listen up 
 Or I'm a tell your momma to whip your butt 
 (Cosmo) 
 Well you ain't my daddy and I'm letting you know 
 That you can't tell me when it's time to go 
 See I get on the mic and show you what it's about 
 'Cause even my momma said knock you out 
 (Mos Def) 
 Well if you didn't know baby boy I'm a tell ya' 
 You need to learn to respect your elders 
 But since you here and you think you got skill 
 Then get on the mic and show your real 
 (Cosmo) 
 Well I'm the devastatin' never fakin' 
 Always keep the party shakin' 
 Steady rockin' never stoppin' 
 Keep the party people jockin' 
 Rock the beat, shock the beat 
 Till it's time to stop the beat 
 Steady moving showin' provin' 
 Keep the party people groovin'

 Well hey young blood that was fresh 
 You just got one hundred on your MC test 
 You got a soul-shocking body-rocking sound you see 
 You need to pack up your bags and get down with me 
 (Chorus with singing in backround) 
 So jam on it, so jam on it 
 I said jam j-jam j-jam on it 
 I said were rocking to the bright early morning 
 I said jam j-jam j-jam on it 
 This is the one to keep inside the jam

98,Mos Def,hiphop,Just Begun,"""We've only just begun"" 
 Oh, yes, indeed, I like this, I like this 
 Hey, yo, Hi-Tek, do me a favor, man 
 Speed it up a little bit 
 From the intro you know I'm so influential 'cause I'm glowing like a candle 
 The focus is so essential, dog; what you tryna get into? 
 I steady the flow, ready to blow like snotty tissue 
 They snitching like Donnie Brasco, I'm counting like Monte Cristo 
 The ghetto full of betrayal like Iago and Othello 
 Your fellow neighbor will slay you; they'll smoke you like cigarillos 
 Police want that info--they'll grill 'em like Portabellos 
 I'm murdering instrumentals 'cause I rap with the conscience 
 Of felons, killers, and monsters, so revealing and honest 
 We're still feeling the promise; some nights I kill 'em with kindness 
 Hitting like Muhammad Ali; you more like Tatyana 
 All this is probably Karma: you dishonored the father 
 Whether it's God almighty or the almighty dollar 
 We follow the prophets like Islamics or the Dalai Lama 
 Your bullet points so hollow they could probably pierce body armor 
 Look in the scope; my people still a target 
 Smile on my face, tears of a sad clown 
 Feeling out of place as I whistle a cab down 
 If I tip extra, can I huff a cig'? 
 Blow my smoke out the window, dropping ashes on the bridge 
 Uh, I'm in New York now like Akeem and Semi was 
 Tryna get the lobby door open from a semi-buzz 
 I just wanna go to the slum 
 And throw my money on the floor like the Notorious B-U-M, uh 
 Build a home, teach a class, start a revolution 
 Free the mind, heal the body, talking evolution 
 This that black Elohim, Anunnaki rap 
 That Farrakhan, Hakeem Olajuwon, Qaddafi rap 
 I dedicate this to my niggas in New Orleans 
 Rocking black and gold stocking caps and fleur-de-lis Shockey hats 
 I'm in the coatroom, screaming ""who that?"" on the double 
 Serving gumbo with a shovel, dog, I'm on another level 
 Me and Kweli come together like two pieces of metal 
 We magnetizing the ghetto 
 Yeah, now here's the memo 
 I'm a rebel without a cause, a bezel without no flaws 
 And, shorty, you straight; bet you look way better without no drawers 
 Let's sweat out this alcohol; bet I'm about to ball 
 And never let up; look how I just crept up without applause 
 Fed up with all the frauds and left y'all without a job 
 The center of attention; this is clever; I'm Pau Gasol 
 Really though I'm LeBron, really don't got my mind 
 On this new school of rappers I will really go Columbine 
 And throw up the diamond sign; boy, you know I'm-a shine 
 Flow is in Ramadan 'cause couple years ago the game had they pajamas on 
 But now they on my dick; man, I should throw a condom on 
 'Cause a nigga coming raw like I ain't got one on 
 And I ain't stopping nor copping no pleas; I just lock and load, squeeze 
 Dog, I'm on a higher level; I'm on top of nosebleeds 
 Niggas say they sick, but when they rock, they don't sneeze 
 Like the nigga on the block waving his glock, but won't squeeze 
 Please 
 Hold your applause until the ceremony end 
 Yours truly, truly blessed, yet again a noble planted 
 Super magic, abracadabra kid 
 Mysterious master Jim, blacker pen, arrowhead 
 With the long-barrel stem and his apparel fresh 
 Harbor lights shining out the black power grid 
 With the Black Power grip, and pure power don't power trip 
 Push the cellar ceiling up and make the tower tip 
 The Gladwell point and Babylon polish 
 All about nothing where it's all about the dollar 
 And mansions on the fault line of a shaky market 
 The Devil at the dance hall thirsty for a partner 
 Get off him; there is not a parcel or a portion 
 Or a measure of a fortune more awesome 
 Gorgeous, the funky Four Horsemen and one more 
 With Hi-Tek on the score, once more, of course 
 You're welcome, thanks 
 Appreciation for your participation 
 Special dedication 
 Celebration, bitches"

 So many emcees focusing on black people extermination 
 We keep it balanced with that knowledge of self, determination 
 It's hot, we be blowing the spots, with conversations 
 C'mon let's smooth it out like Soul Sensation 
 We in the house like Japanese in Japan, or Koreans in Korea 
 Head to Philly and free Mumia with the Kujichagulia true 
 Singing is swinging and writing is fighting, but what 
 They writing got us clashing like titans it's not exciting 
 No question, being a black man is demanding 
 The fire's in my eyes and the flames need fanning [Repeat: x3] 
 (Repeat: x4) 
 With that what? (Knowledge Of Self) Determination 
 Things I say and do, may not come quite through 
 My words may not convey just what I'm feeling 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 Yes yes come on, yes yes 
 Knowledge Of Self is like life after death 
 With that you never worry about your last breath 
 Death comes, that's how I'm living, it's the next days 
 The flesh goes underground, the book of life, flip the page 
 Yo they asking me how old, we living the same age 
 I feel the rage of a million niggas locked inside a cage 
 At exactly which point do you start to realize 
 That life without knowledge is, death in disguise? 
 That's why, Knowledge Of Self is like life after death 
 Apply it, to your life, let destiny manifest 
 Different day, same confusion, we're gonna take this 
 Hip-hop shit and keep it moving, shed a little light 
 Now y'all blooming like a flower with the power of the evident 
 Voices and drums original instruments 
 In the flesh presently presenting my representation 
 With that what? (Knowledge Of Self) Determination [Repeat: x6] 
 Things I say and do, may not come quite through 
 My words may not convey just what I'm feeling [Repeat: x2] 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 The most important time in history is, now, the present 
 So count your blessings cause time can't define the essence 
 But you stressing over time and you follow the Roman calendar 
 These people enter Cona like Gattaca, you can bet 
 They trying to lock you down like Attica, the African diaspora 
 Represents strength in numbers, a giant can't slumber forever 
 I know you gotta get that cheddar whatever 
 Hey yoI heard you twice the first time money, get it together 
 You must be History, you repeating yourself out of the pages 
 You keeping yourself depleting your spiritual wealth 
 That quick cash'll get your ass quick fast in houses of detention 
 Inner-city concentration camps where no one pays attention 
 Or mentions the ascension of death, till nothing's left 
 The young, gifted and Black are sprung addicted to crack 
 All my people where y'all at cause, y'all ain't here 
 And your hero's using your mind as a canvas to paint fear 
 With, broad brush strokes and tales of incarceration 
 You get out of jail with that Knowledge of Self determination 
 Stand in ovation, cause you put the Hue in Human 
 Cause and effect, effect everything you do 
 And that's why I got love in the face of hate 
 Hands steady so the lines in the mental illustration is straight 
 The thought you had don't even contemplate 
 Infinite like figure eight there's no escape 
 From that what? (Knowledge Of Self) Determination [Repeat: x4] 
 (Repeat: x2) 
 Things I say and do, may not come quite through 
 My words may not convey just what I'm feeling 
 (Repeat: x2) 
 Things I say and do, may not come quite through 
 My words may not convey just what I'm feeling 
 What I'm feeling, what I'm feeling, oh, what I'm feeling"

 We rep the ain't-gots 
 Ain't nobody can't start no party like us, we crush the faint hearts 
 From Hallsey to St. Mark's, walk in the main blocks 
 Painted with blood that's still hot, so deep it stain socks 
 The pain spark frustration, situations lead to hatin' 
 Some deal with drug distribution, others walk the plantation 
 Some know the code a' the streets, some got a college education 
 Come down on the weekend, and peep the conversation 
 (Mos) 
 Yo 
 On the corner, units stormed out 
 Ghetto lookin' bombed out 
 Police waited to roll, for those who walk the wrong route 
 Shorties goin' all out, they got they swords drawn out 
 Ready to brawl out, gettin' fought till they fall out 
 Black like Morehouse, 40 o'z is tossed out 
 For brothers that they mourn bout, get wrecked till it's dawn out 
 Whether they broke or flossed out, honeys pass they draws out 
 Lookin' for a ticket out the poor-house 
 A jungle out here 
 Lions keep they claws out, fangs and jaws out 
 Weak just get forced out 
 Names is called out, ghetto-fame is sought out 
 You wanna be the man that they talk bout 
 I walked out 
 I had some things on my mind to sort out 
 I thought 'bout the wild circumstance we born out 
 Remember myself at your age, when I was just like you 
 If that was now, I don't know what I would do 
 My answer's? closest to me 
 So what I say to you is goin' for me 
 Son we both still growin' indeed 
 But where you at, I was, and where you been, I left 
 Utilize my experience to guide your step 
 Some people get love but don't command respect 
 It's somethin' that you can't ride with a check 
 Over-rollin' your lex or icy links that hang from your neck 
 If it's real, who need to deal with the special effects? 
 (Kweli) 
 Come here, come here, yo 
 Lemme drop this on ya, look they gotchu cornered 
 The corner of the block is hot, I ain't got to warn ya 
 'Cause I see you every day, trapped in every way 
 'Shit, I'm a thug, and that's all that I can say' 
 Who are you anyway? 
 Mary J.? I spend, many nights awake, watchin you while you sleep 
 Tryin' to figure out how to be the example, 'cause talk is cheap 
 As you walk the streets, study cats on the real 
 In a convo, just make your point to relax and chill 
 [Niggas] wanna destroy each other in a cypher instead a' build 
 Be a- man of will, don't be- standin still 
 If you- don't plan ahead, then you- plan to fail 
 Do ? in a daze when the ways reveal 
 Like they funny style but I'm not laughin' 
 Serious [niggas] makin' money while the police is passin 
 Can't wait for opportunity to knock, you gotta make it happen 
 It ain't about no spectacular ways a' rappin' 
 Just immaculate ways a' action... dig? 
 (Mos sings) 
 Little Brother 
 I know that times is hard 
 Keep your mind on guard 
 Stay clear of things that are harmin 
 You'll get along 
 I sing my song 
 For little brothers 
 Out there in the street 
 Strugglin to make ends meet 
 Gotta hold the heat 
 Strugglin so hard to compete 
 Stay clear of things that harm 
 Do it for y'all 
 Try to stay strong 
 Keep movin on [6x]

 Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true? 
 You've started back doing 
 The things you used to do 
 As I was motivatin' over the hill 
 I saw Maybellenein a coup de ville 
 A Cadillac a-rollin' on the open road 
 Nothin' will outrun my V8 Ford 
 The cadillac doin' 'bout ninety-five 
 She's bumper to bumber 
 Rollin' side by side 
 Maybellene, why can't you be true? 
 Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true? 
 You've started back doing 
 The things you used to do 
 Pink in the mirror on top of the hill 
 It's just like swallowin' up 
 A medicine pill 
 First thing I saw that Cadillac grille 
 Doin' a hundred 
 And ten gallopin' over that hill 
 Offhill curve, a downhill stretch 
 Me and that Cadillac neck by neck 
 The Cadillac pulled up ahead of the Ford 
 The Ford got hot and wouldn't do no more 
 It then got cloudy and it started to rain 
 I tooted my horn for a passin' lead 
 The rain water blowin' all under my hood 
 I knew that was doin' my motor good 
 The motor cooled down, the heat went down 
 And that's when I heard that highway sound 
 The Cadillac a-sittin' like a ton of lead 
 A hundred and ten a half a mile ahead 
 The Cadillac lookin' like it's sittin' still 
 And I caught Maybelline at the top of the hill"

 Welcome to Soundview projects 
 Bronx, New York, 10473 
 Intersection action ribs touching 
 New gutter smacks replacing the whole Dutchman 
 Loose Mamis fucking, they definite land mines 
 Dudes with no right hustle throwing gang signs 
 Empty in the webbings broke and underpaid 
 Fighting federal cases with legal aids 
 The unlit stage tonight performing lime desires to eat 
 Can get you in a 8 by 5, the Corner's younger 
 I smell, feel, touch and taste they hunger 
 Next in line to rep these street signs to they blunder 
 Under, wiping tears from his eyes facing the felony 
 These niggaz wanna be pistol Pete without the penalty 
 His last words, promise me this much in death 
 Don't let my boy live to retrace my steps 
 Minne, stay safe, move quiet and get it 
 If you encounter opposition get a inch from they face with it 
 Later amigo, digest the day to end discreetly 
 Sex money and boss 
 My ties to hear me see me 
 True villain 
 Face covered, driving gloves 
 Commit by my lonely when push comes to shove 
 They say that grown men lay on they prey 
 Took shorts in the street 
 Came back and made up for that with that white sheet 
 Revenge is best served cold 
 Get it the same way you give it 
 This ain't fear I just need to get away with it 
 Son, stop over here, you looking at me like I'm lame 
 But I'm looking at y'all like y'all call this the drug game 
 Grand child hosing sims 
 Put the heroin in Queens 
 Put pops freeman on in the early seventies 
 I sat in rooms with money machines 
 Drugs sitting 3 feet off of the floor 
 Cover the smell of the raw 
 Chest moves like bars scale my connects untimely 
 King Henry from 12th street flooded the Bronx in the 90's 
 03 scene MVP and one accord 
 Boss makes decision, paper wins awards 
 See me, hear me 
 Welcome to Brooklyn, New York City 11206 
 Roosevelt projects, wild rose water the plant 
 Son, you know what it is 
 From the moment that you come over the bridge 
 And if you don't ride with me 
 I'm gonna show you some shit 
 I'ma show you where my niggaz stay sure on the mix 
 I'ma show you where the pain and the poetry is 
 Ghetto young's spend a lot of time alone in the crib 
 BET on the screen, walls and posters of big 
 Hustlers getting dough sitting low on the 6 
 Blazing up the ambro glow over they wrist 
 Hop in the game knowing the risk 
 Still down to load up they clip 
 Gamblers with hopes of rolling the trip 
 But when you hear head crack there ain't no rolling again 
 Snatch the dice and everything you want is going it in 
 This how it happens, good people, bad habits 
 Diabetics, crack addicts, asthmatics 
 Searching for the truth leaping through the holy tablet 
 The bible, the Quran, or the Ten crack Commandments 
 Speak on it God, what's today's mathematics 
 The five day forecast, the Dow Jones average 
 The price of beer, cigarettes, bread, milk and pampers 
 Life is a test and we all got the answer 
 The streets keep calling its hard not answer 
 And on my Government, my attribute, my all 
 So it's only natural I holla black and respond 
 Brooklyn stand up and make 'em all sit down 
 I call but no [Incomprehensible] we do not fuck around 
 That's what it is 
 All day 
 That's what is niggaz 
 Official, official 
 That's how it is niggaz

 In she came with the same type game 
 The hairdo, Prada shoes, brand new Gucci frame 
 Big thangs, so big you can't hardly explain 
 When she done crossed her legs, she make mind turn insane 
 Had seen her on the ave and spotted her, how I wanted her 
 Ass so fat she (?) (?) fella

 Oh, Nadine, honey, is that you? 
 Seems like every time I see you

 And started walkin' toward a coffee colored Cadillac

 I was campaign shouting like a southern diplomat 
 Nadine, honey, is that you? 
 Oh, Nadine, honey, where are you? 
 Seems like every time I catch up with you 
 You're up to something new 
 Downtown searching for her looking all around 
 Saw her getting in a yellow cab heading up town 
 I caught a loaded taxi, paid up everybody's tab 
 With a twenty dollar bill told him, ""Catch that yellow cab"" 
 Nadine, honey, is that you? 
 Oh, Nadine, honey, is that you? 
 Seems like every time I catch up with you 
 You're up to something new 
 She moves around like a wave of summer breeze 
 Go, driver, go, go, catch her for me please 
 Moving through the traffic like a mounted cavalier 
 Leaning out the taxi window trying to make her hear

 In my automobile

 Beside me 
 At the wheel 
 I stole a kiss 
 At the turn 
 Of a mile 
 My curiosity 
 Running wild 
 Crusin' and playin' 
 The radio 
 With no particular 
 Place to go 
 Riding along 
 In my automobile 
 I's anxious 
 Tto tell her 
 The way I feel 
 So I told her 
 Softly and sincere 
 And she leaned 
 And whispered 
 In my ear 
 Cuddlin' more 
 And drivin' slow 
 With no particular 
 Place to go 
 No particular 
 Place to go 
 So we parked way 
 Out on ko-ko-mo 
 The night was young 
 And the moon 
 Was gold 
 So we both decided 
 To take a stroll 
 Can you image 
 The way I felt 
 I couldn't 
 Unfasten her 
 Safety belt 
 Riding along 
 In my calaboose 
 Still trying 
 To get her 
 Belt a-loose 
 All the way home 
 I held a grudge 
 For the safety belt 
 That wouldn't budge 
 Crusin' and playin'

 One for the treble, two for the bass 
 Welcome to the great incredible paper chase 
 Keep your boots laced if you want to keep pace 
 Oh No 
 Niggas ain't scared to hustle 
 It's been seven days, the same clothes 
 Ask them originals 'cause they know 
 Mos Def, Nate Dogg, and Pharoahe 
 Step away from the mic they too cold 
 The funk might fracture your nose 
 (Mos Def) 
 Say my name, say my name 
 Observe how I stake my claim, I independently lay it down 
 And played my game, my own two raise my flame 
 Cause dick ridin' ain't my thang 
 I earned what they said I wouldn't 
 I got it the way they said I couldn't 
 But now I'm gettin' it and they whole grill is crooked 
 Mad 'cause I'm gettin' caked out from my bookings 
 When y'all was askin permission I just stepped up and took it 
 What!? The kid's better buy my rookie card now 
 Cause after this year the price ain't comin' down 
 And if you got a joint bubblin then get money now 
 Cause in a minute, there's gonna be some real trouble comin' out 
 Just a warnin, as usual some cats wont heed it 
 The hard headed always gotta feel it to believe it 
 It's a shame that jealous gaze is too short to see it 
 But when they face hit the cement, they nod in agreement 
 We could play nice and decent, or dirty like the 7-1 Precinct 
 Call it a day or make it a long evenin 
 You keep on schemin, man give me some more reason 
 To have the women in your mama's church screamin ""Lord Jesus!"" 
 Harder than y'all 'cause I'm smarter than y'all 
 I know that deep down it's got to be bothering y'all 
 Pay attention, watch fly gon' get larger than y'all 
 Put your pride on the rocks, make you swallow it all 
 The mathematic problem for y'all, it just get harder to solve 
 Every day that the saga evolve 
 The do or die stay rumblin and bumblin hard 
 And when we move, we ain't got no discussion at all 
 East coast on your neck and you ain't shruggin it off 
 Try to bullyfoot and end up stumblin off 
 I'm Daddy Brooklyn, y'all niggaz are the sons of New York 
 Gettin' spanked when there's too much trouble to talk 
 Respect mine 
 Oh No 
 Look at who they let in the back door 
 From Long Beach to Brooklyn they know 
 We rock from the East to West coast 
 Queens salute to Pharoahe (you know) 
 Step away from the mic they too cold 
 The funk might fracture your nose 
 Very contagious raps should be trapped in cages 
 Through stages of wackness, Pharoahe's raps are blazin' 
 And it amazes - me how you claim thug 
 But go two-ways without SkyTel pagers 
 I'm intellectual, pass more essays/ese's 
 Than motorcade police parades through East L.A. 
 More beef then deli's, thus what I vent is just 
 What you lust to vent is irrele' 
 Huh, hallelujah, Pharoahe Monch'll do ya 
 Maintain the same frame of mind - screw ya! 
 Get the picture, sit ya, seat ya, preacher with scriptures 
 I'm equipped to rip ya, reach ya 
 Pharoahe and Mos is verbal osmosis 
 Coast to coast, we boast to be the most explosive here 
 Ferocious, the lyrical prognosis 
 The dosage is leavin' you mentally unfocused here 
 MC's just - come on 'round 
 You're the next contestants on ""Catch-A-Beat-Down"" 
 Don't be hesitant, sound cracks the sediment 
 It's evident we medicine for your whole town 
 Sky's the limit, game's infinite when I'm in it 
 All windows is tinted, how you seein me when I'm in it? 
 Rap, we got it on lock man, stop that 
 Put that mic back down, boy, drop that 
 Pharoahe's flows blows shows like afros 
 We hate y'all though, that's why Nate Dogg goes: 
 -Nate Dogg: repeat two times- 
 Oh No 
 Niggas ain't scared to hustle 
 It's been seven days, the same clothes 
 Ask them originals 'cause they know 
 Mos Def, Nate Dogg, and Pharoahe 
 Step away from the mic they too cold 
 The funk might fracture your nose 
 Oh No 
 Look at who they let in the back door 
 From Long Beach to Brooklyn they know 
 We rock from the East to West coast 
 Queens salute to Pharoahe (you know) 
 Step away from the mic they too cold 
 The funk might fracture your nose"

 Yo you sent out the signal right? 
 And this is what happened 
 The voice of Hip Hop got heard 
 Never comprimised this is how we put it down c'mon 
 (Kool G Rap) 
 Throughout my thuglife I've seen the ??? 
 Like ??? fight over the role of dice 
 Flashing whole lights when killas on a hiest 
 So contight, get poltergiest over the bowl of Christ 
 Who pulled the slice from cats aiming gats who showed the hiest 
 Told you right she be the one that come and hold your mic 
 Then aim it at the whole vice squad just like ??? 
 Rollin' like every prototype was dolomight 
 One man recall his ice inside his gun hand he holds for life 
 (Rah Digga) 
 This for the ones with holes in they graves 
 Waitin for they piece when the law misbehave 
 I say we off ??? watch 'em walk the beat 
 Like you can't cross streets make them all retreat 
 (Now) Judges and the jury be a little to appointed 
 Making us defendants when we supossed to be the plantiffs 
 Laugh now cause soon the thrill stops 
 Heads get it on and start to kill cops 
 (Sporty Theivz) 
 I'm sober but the pull me over 
 What I do yo? (what we do yo?) 
 Poe-poe go I'm drivin' to slow (cool yo) 
 I torin' them explorin them (damn) 
 For them that's why I'm ignoring them (uh-oh) 
 Bring like king skip 
 Before they bring this to some Rodeny King shit 
 Forget them fools 
 Now make no sudden moves 
 They reachin' for they tools (let's move) 
 You buggin dude 
 Kirk you ran the stop, word them pigs frontin 
 Yo tell like you tell 'em cousin we ain't did nothin' 
 All they see is three blacks in a jeep with seats back 
 Lookin' for ??? packs how the blood dog can eat that 
 They thirstin for a reason to blast you can't beat that 
 Gats and a badge to match you can beat that so bounce 'em

 It's even deeper then that penal shot in the back 
 Forever we fight and 'cause but the world still adjust 
 So many bullets just to stop one man 
 Is that the plan, 
 To leave us all dead in the street

 I'm an opponent of violence 
 To many of my guys have to condome it in silence 
 Law takes lives and can only do violence 
 And with night sticks I write quick 
 Hopin that

 Ma's been singin' to law like they background vocals

 To protect the property 
 How can I just stand by and watch a man die for nothin' and not react 
 The way we spit on this track is how we bustin' back

 Get behind them and make the marks drive slow

 Cops they transport me from Long island to Medina 
 With they fucked up demeanor 
 Dreamin' of stickin it to me like Abner Louima 
 Pharoahe slash El-Hajj Malik Shabazz 
 With plans of retaliations of they coward ass 
 God please allow me to preach for 'em 
 A voiceless man through a spirit I speek for him 
 Step to city hall if a dove flew for Diallo 
 With a vision of cops inside the Public Enemy logo 
 (Posdnous) 
 All that scheming and plotting 
 The young absorb like cotton does 
 Ecspeacially in my city where the boys steady rockin' in 
 You would thought 5-0 would cut it all short 
 But they play the biggest part in the art of living arms 
 In our land cops guns clap more then hands 
 As if we don't deserve what they hear to preserve 
 We just tryin' to do it right in these worlds that we rappin' in 
 While they trying to fill us all up with more lead then zepilin

 The precinct is crooked, my man got grabbed up 
 Had cracks on him worth about a bullet 
 They just took it, asked him questions like, ""Where's the guns?"" 
 They tried to cheat him to tell them where was Un 
 The God ten deep in a red fifteen passenger 
 Guns out when they jumped out, pointed at us 
 Here comes, what they call a procedure 
 Slammin' us against a gate, cuffin us before they beat us 
 (Channel Live) 
 It's like they can't trust us, they wanna bust us 
 And crush us, they sayin' f' us, there's no peace, no just-us 
 They claim to protect us, they serve and they wreck us 
 Never respect us, arrest us and always stress us 
 To see the Devil die is my purpose of to live up 
 Self-determinance is the must, I practice Kool G jog-a-leos

 Yo, forget police brutality, I worked for a salary 
 And did time for a crime I didn't commit 
 They tried to beat me in my head, make a brotha submit 
 Hit me in the face with sticks, lockin me down for bein around 
 Still remember, never surrender into the beast 
 The man, peace for Diallo 
 My reality is to fight back police brutality 
 (Crunch Lo (of Othorized F.A.M.)) 
 Mr. Officer got my trapped in a dark corridor 
 Long hallway, they in luck with the gunplay 
 Swing knight sticks, run thicker than Bloods and Crips 
 Harass mad cats and it don't make sense 
 Roll around in dark tints, fiendin to match finger prints 
 Search me down everyday and you still ain't content 
 (Rock (of Heltah Skeltah)) 
 Oh-oh-oh-oh 
 Calm your nerves down, bop your heads too high 
 Let 'em know Rock, stop wonderin why you keep gettin' knocked 
 'Cause you a part time dealer, prob'ly a part time pops 
 Not a part time killer, but them dudes is full time cops 
 Make a hustle stupid, you half *ass* black acts

 Runnin' your mouth, oh yeah, stop runnin' from beasts"

 California on my mind 
 I straddled that Greyhound, rode him into Raleigh 
 And on across to Caroline 
 Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill 
 We never was a minute late 
 We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown 
 Rollin' out of Georgia State 
 We had motor trouble 
 It turned into a struggle half way 'cross Alabama 
 And that 'Hound broke down and left us all stranded 
 In downtown Birmingham 
 Right away I bought me a through train ticket 
 Ridin' cross Mississippi Clean 
 And I was on that midnight flyer out of Birmingham 
 Smoking into New Orleans 
 Somebody help me get out of Louisiana 
 Just help me get to Houston town 
 And there're people there who care a little 'bout me 
 And they won't let the poor boy down 
 Sure as you're born they bought me a silk suit 
 Put luggage in my hands 
 And I woke up high over Albuquerque 
 On a jet to the promised land 
 Workin' on a T-bone steak a la carte 
 Flying over to the Golden State 
 Oh, when the pilot told me in thirteen minutes 
 He would set us at the terminal gate 
 Swing low sweet chariot come down easy 
 Taxi to the terminal zone 
 Cut your engines and cool your wings 
 And let me make it to the telephone 
 Los Angeles, give me Norfolk Virginia 
 Tidewater, four, ten-o-nine 
 Tell the folks back home this is the promised land callin' 
 And the poor boy's on the line"

 Fall back without recovering time, and time's up

 Bend a needle on the mind and it's back

 Be sharp as a tack, fall back you smarter than that 
 Or perhaps you just ain't as smart as you think 
 Figure 8'n on the thin ice part of the rink 
 You a vessel that's promised to sink 
 Terra Firma ain't as hard as you think 
 Stare down, and you starting to blink 
 Like 182 this for fellas and the ladies who 
 Don't need to be spoon fed like baby food 
 I take a bite out the track like a Sabre-tooth 
 And spit out the truth 
 Till the cops come and spray the booth 
 It's all right with you it's all right with me 
 Do the damn thing what you wanna be (Supreme, Supreme) 
 That's right, that's right that's right that's right 
 That's right, that's right that's right that's right (Supreme, Supreme) 
 It's all right with you it's all right with me 
 Do the damn thing what you wanna be (Supreme, Supreme) 
 That's right, that's right that's right that's right 
 That's right, that's right that's right that's right (Supreme, Supreme) 
 It's all right with you it's all right with me

120,Mos Def,hiphop,Talkin To You,"[Mos Def] *talking behind singing vocals* 
 It's always the nervous cats, that's like... 
 Yo money, you tryin' to dis me or something? 
 What you tryin' to get fly or something? 
 You tryin' to get a little rep off me or something, money? 
 Let me tell you something money, you don't know me like that 
 NawI'msayin, you don't know none of my crew like that 
 NawI'msayin, and if you really wanna make some little insinuation 
 About me nawI'msayin, don't talk about it, be about it money 
 If you wanna do something, we can do it right now 
 (Pharoahe Monch) 
 I levitate through meditation 
 Sitting my legs crossed, source to build force field 
 To shield my immediate surroundings 
 Avoiding falling sheet rock, rubble and granite 
 Expand, white man, got plans to feed the planet 
 Excessive hate, repercussions of manic-depressive state 
 Panic, God forbid we all take it for granted 
 Delivering lyrical thoughts for spiritual dividends 
 Half the concentrate, like Hampstead we'll be livin' in 
 Magnetic boring them, it's a must I score again 
 And pollute em, shoot 'em like white students in Oregon 
 'Cause when I was broke, I always found figures to fuck bitches 
 Wit full-force like them muscle-bound niggas 
 (Rah Digga) 
 Well it's the R-A-H, big up to Brick City 
 When I'm not rippin niggas I be ?feelin' wit committee? 
 Got two rap clicks, so bring all the kingred 
 Buggin off of rappers sayin' shit that I been said 
 Askin me how your mob sound, bringin' my high down 
 Flipmode put shit together quicker than a seamstress 
 Thinkin' I talk white 'cause I speak proper English 
 All up in your air like I was celly interference 
 Rip shows and make little cameo appearance 
 White label to death if I can't get no clearance 
 [Mos Def] *talking behind vocals* 
 Alot of cats think I'm trapped in a box, livin' cruel and if that's true 
 I'm talkin' to you 
 Thinkin' of dissin your steez, your degress, everything you're attached to then 
 I'm talkin' to you 
 Wonderin who we talkin' about, yo is my name in his mouth, well then 
 I'm talkin' to you 
 No mystery, you ain't got to scratch your head 
 Like ""Is he dissin me?"", we talkin' to you 
 (A-Butta) 
 Aiyyo we severed the lever that I pull 
 It's never the bull, shit instead of the full clip, click 
 You get hit in the head wit dialect 
 When I pre-fect my new script 
 Check the architect then select the newest blueprint 
 When I pro-ject the move-meant of the mic, it might strike 
 And brand new life trife that handle 
 ?Flyin off?, literature that's pure 
 Yo we miniature before, you finished yours, I get mine 
 Musically inclined, like the sign of a clef 
 To my death, I rhyme and yes I left you, sense-less in the mind 
 Plus I'm, going to show no re-pentance 
 My flow's relentless, you know the sentence 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 You will respect it when we set it 
 Fake MC's get tossed 
 For leavin' the microphone covered wit the gloss 
 Don't get lost, bitch-asses who switch fastest 
 When my hits smashes, impacts like whip crashes 
 Fuckin' up your face like thick glasses 
 You still can't see shit 
 I'll snatch your faith, your imagination won't believe it 
 It's ill, you can't conceive it 
 Any nigga can make a baby, it takes a man to be a father 
 Why bother, you'll be run over in the street like Frogger 
 Comatose like Central Park joggers when my crew goes wildin 
 Lyricist who will never Lounge till all wack shit is silenced 
 I'm not violent, niggas come aggressive wit that nonsense 
 Yo, it's time for us to get aggressive wit our conscience 
 (Mos Def) 
 Alot of cats think I'm chattin about 
 Them and they crew, and if that's true 
 I'm talkin' to you 
 Wondering if I'm dissin you and everything you're attached to 
 I'm talkin' to you 
 Runnin' your mouth, wonderin ""yo, who Mos be talkin' bout?"" 
 I'm talkin' to you 
 No mystery, you can consider yourself dissed officially 
 You can consider yourself dissed officially 
 You can consider yourself dissed officially

121,Mos Def,hiphop,The Day,"Whack niggas sleep rappin' and woke up in trouble 
 Whack niggas with that sleep rap and then woke up in trouble 
 You were cool ten years ago, your fucking legs bubble 
 Brand new tires 
 Rollin' down the same old strip new party same old chicks 
 I'm so sorry 
 If I don't look happy to be here 
 In your label office 'cause they said I can't smoke weed here 
 Man fuck it I'm out black on 
 Than I'm 'bout it fool 
 I got a studio in my house 
 Along with some the perks 
 That come with my work 
 Thirty-twenty something sleepin' in my diamond supplied shirt 
 There is not a adjective to describe how I work 
 Hard is not enough brother I'm tougher 
 Whack niggas sleepin' with that rappin' and woke up in trouble 
 You was cool ten yours ago your fucking legs bubbles, bubble 
 You gotta now when to hold 'em now when to fold em 
 Learn how to roll with the punches 
 Take 'em to school give these niggas brown bag lunches 
 If it ain't the jets then it ain't nothing 
 Yo the king closed his cloak 
 The set was overfull 
 Such a excellent moment 
 So emotional 
 He rushed out on the field 
 So devoted for 
 Final victory clutch they went postal cold 
 Glory overload 
 Hold up hold my coat 
 Please remember this day 
 This changes everything we can do anything 
 So you show anyway 
 My momma told me was always call a spade a spade 
 Be like chuck d never be like flavor flav', 
 But that clock around his neck is so fly and the way he complimentin' 
 Chuckie with that bow tie flow make me feel high so 
 I'm goin' spit it my way excuse me as I do me 
 Cruisin' rudely down the high way 
 I'm young black intelligent elegant blaza' 
 Back to the thesis 
 To to shooting kraps and talking smack to the polices 
 Back to black and gold valleys 
 Dit knees with the creases 
 Pullin' youngin' by the coattails 
 Schoolin' 'em who the beast is 
 I pray this flow is dumb enough ugh 
 I pray my heart is D.M.C. and rev run enough 
 'Cause I'm a throw my number up 
 I'm a throw some chicken bones and feathers on a hundred bucks 
 And summon up the thunder what? 
 The voodoo man is coming bro 
 Can't see the forest full of trees 
 It's okay, I got my jigsaw and my jumber truck 
 Tell them boys their run is up 
 The king rose his and spoke 
 The set was overfull 
 Such a beautiful moment 
 So emotional 
 They cried out on the field 
 So devoted for 
 Whole team champion they went postal cold 
 Power overload 
 Hold up hold my coat 
 Please remember this day 
 This changes and so you show anyway 
 We ready for anything"

 When the nightfall come, we in the right war 
 Cats who spill blood for a cause, not just because 
 Defy the authority and follow god's law 
 Revolutionary entrepreneurs, who make the fans 
 Clap they hands and stompin the floor not start the applause 
 Thank you very much, without further ado 
 Let me introduce the rest of my crew, mos def!

 Things changed since we came out, been some shit in new york 
 Niggaz stopped gettin' jig in new york, bloods and crips in new york 
 The y-2-k celebration wasn't big in new york 
 Babylon live in new york, should I keep a crib in new york 
 Or just v.i., to handle my b.i. 
 When with my a-alikes we see with three eyes 
 Yo kweli I agree I, was thinkin' the same thing myself 
 Smog in the city ain't no good for your health 
 Things changed in new york, type strange in new york 
 Forty-deuce don't look the same in new york 
 Just politics, tricks and big games in new york 
 Switched trains a writer can't get fame in new york 
 Internet and wall street got paid in new york 
 Poor folks and workin class got slayed in new york 
 Even still, everyday they make weight in new york 
 Flashlights lookin' for a brighter day in new york 
 In new york they say it's red hot 
 Will the temperature ease up? black I guess not 
 It's multi-lane traffic, no sign for rest stops 
 No corner breaks, put on your gloves and just box 
 No dance school to teach you to wop and bus stop 
 Better get up in the booth, hop up and just rock 
 If you think it's like that, it's not so just stop 
 All mankind time runnin' down on one watch, just watch 
 If, you, are, just, coming, in, I, will 
 Say it, once, more, so, you, can, hear, cause 
 You, need, to, get, up, right, now 
 And, move, with, this, yes, this, means, you 
 You, you 
 Yo, mos def and talib kweli bring disaster to the industry 
 We best-sellin authors writin great chapters in history 
 These cats undercover like gay rappers dealin' with mystery 
 My platinum grey matter spray batter that's specifically 
 Designed to make rappers break faster than eggshells in the mornin 
 Inhaled the divine in that's laid dormant 
 Water from the well stay pourin 
 I answer back when I hear fate callin 
 Freedom fighter ready to attack at the crack of a new day dawnin 
 Way more than necessary skills for the application 
 My flow is great like the lakes and it rocks like applachains 
 My facts more than make up for what you lack in imagination 
 You more confused than tiger woods when he made up cabalaysian 
 I'm sayin'! 
 Break bounds like the jet concorde 
 Win awards before I leave for my world award tour 
 When they scream encore, that's when they want more 
 Flow steadily, whether I'm on or off shore 
 High potent, zone coastin, no jokin 
 Safecracker sniff gon' keep the joint open 
 Peep the focus, high resolution, high reception 
 My ""train of thought"" connectin with my bredren from reflection like 
 You, need, to, get, up, right, now 
 And, move, with, this, yes, this, means, you, again! 
 You, need, to, get, up, right, now

 Memories don't live like people 
 I have to pack up my bags and leave you 
 When you're gone I am longing to see 
 I'm a travellin man, movin through 
 I'm leaving, on a jet, when you're gone I get so upset 
 I'm a travellin man, movin through places 
 Packed my bags, arranged my suitcases 
 I got to tie up both my shoe laces 
 Kiss my cheek and see me gone 
 I'm leaving, but God willing I'll be back 
 I'm leaving, headed on the fast track 
 Aiyyo six in the morning, I'm up at dawn crackin' 
 Wash up my face and start my back packin 
 Get my head together for the fantastic voyage 
 On a fastbreak like the georgetown hoyas 
 Kiss my baby bye, tell my honey don't cry 
 Wipe the tear from her eye, say so long then I fly 
 Then I'm off into limitless space wit swift pace 
 Left a few g's at the place just in case 
 Wit hace I get snappy, hit the corner hail a cabby 
 Brooklyn expressway, on the jfk 
 And wit no delay, so step on it dog-gonit 
 These fly outta-staters got the paper and I want it 
 The voice on percussion need no introduction 
 The mighty mos def on DJ honda production 
 My jam keep you buzzin, like cash and good lovin' 
 I'm stayin farm fresh, I ain't mos def for nuttin 
 So if you're in the groove let me see you move something 
 You're in the tri-state and you high stakes hunting 
 You wake up in the morn' sayin' ""must make something"" 
 Well I got something special to make, let's motivate 
 Say memories don't live like people 
 I have to pack up my bags and leave you 
 When you're gone I am longing to see 
 I'm a travellin man, movin through places 
 I'm leaving, on a big jet 
 I got to hurry up and keep up in step 
 A travellin man, movin through places 
 Packed my bags, arranged my suitcases 
 I got to tie up both my shoelaces 
 Kiss my cheeks and see me gone 
 I'm leaving, but I won't be too long 
 I'm leaving, and I'll be good while I'm gone 
 I'm leaving *with variations* 
 But I'll be back again, but I'll be back again 
 I'm makin' tracks again, step it up, my garmet bag on my back again 
 ""Here we go, there it is"" 
 Yo it's the first class mission wit first class provision 
 The pray and hard work results is good livin' 
 Let's hear it for the gettin', let's get all that we can 
 It's important and it's scorching so the fortune expand 
 Crossin borders of land, along the sands of time 
 I came to motivate the masses wit the standard of rhyme 
 You're understandin that I'm (so fresh) 
 They know it all across the planet that I'm (so fresh) 
 Mos def, takin' both steps forward, these notes was recorded 
 The area's applauded, I feel so rewarded 
 By the grace of allah, you can shine like a star 
 The more you realize reality the better you are 
 But now I'm swayze, three minutes and change, you know the game 
 Gotta skate, plenty paper to make, here come the plane 'cause 
 Memories don't live like people, I have to pack up my bags and leave you 
 When you're gone I am longing to see 
 I'm a travellin man, movin through spaces 
 I'm leaving, on a big jet, when I'm gone you get so upset 
 I'm a travellin man, movin through places 
 Packed my bags, arranged my suitcases 
 I'm out to see some brand new faces 
 Kiss my cheeks and see me gone 
 I'm leaving, but I won't be too long 
 I'm leaving, so dry your eyes while I'm gone 
 I'm leaving *with variations*

 But no you haven't well least that's how it seem to me 
 My home town is like a whole different scenery 
 The old timers on the stoop leaning leisurely 
 The new jacks up in the bar smokin' greenery 
 Easily taken for granted when you up in it but its sweet scented 
 When you been down for a minute 
 Move around city damage 
 Break it down with the vintage 
 The innovative 
 Classical B-Boy image 
 Collect the winners 
 'Cause that's the reason that we came here 
 This thing is not a game here 
 The fortune not the fame here 
 From New York to the Cakalaks

 Infiltrate Virginia State

 I radiate the space like a up-right bass 
 Son I leave crews laced and escape wit no trace 
 Sound official like the finish time at a horse race 
 Here to put it in place, for the nine-uno-seis 
 Mos Def set the pace, make your fam give chase 
 Raise your hands in the air, everybody get wit it 
 Universal Magnetic b-boy, scientific 
 It's like that and you don't stop 
 It goes onto the rhythm you don't stop 
 Raise your hands in the air, everybody get wit it 
 The Universal Magnetic B-BOY, scientific y'all 
 You don't stop, it goes onto the rhythm bust it 
 Baby it's in my chromosomes to ROCK 
 Microphones sets who wanna test the M-O 
 Best to leave that *nigga* alone 
 I make no bones or poems about droppin' bars 
 I make the world full swing under the Mos Def YES 
 I ring the alarm like tennis sore 
 My style hella-raw, I keep it raw bone like Skeletor 
 And you should go and tell your clientele 
 That they need to get The Message like Melle Mel 
 I got the -- locked like a Death Row show 
 And if I ain't a b-boy, Premier never used a bell (ding ding) 
 So tell your boy, (what) crew to retire 
 Before I make they *ass* catch fire like Richard Pryor 
 Nondescriptive fiendin for riches, callin earths *bitches* 
 But most of y'all brothers is livin' wit your mothers 
 Your Boogie Man yankin up your covers 
 Sharper than some new box cutters, on Parkay's and butters 
 And Stevie Wonder's, to make you run and tell the others 
 The beat lovers, and play my jam like the numbers 
 Son I rock the globe like I rocked your boat 
 I'm bout to tap it on your shoulder 'cause you got to know 
 Now raise your hands in the air, everybody get wit it 
 The Universal Magnetic b-boy, scientific 
 Like that, and you don't stop 
 It goes onto the rhythm you don't stop 
 And raise your hands in the air, everybody get wit it 
 Universal Magnetic B-BOY, (hoo!) scientific 
 You don't stop, it goes onto the rhythm you don't stop 
 Raise your hands in the air, everybody get wit it 
 Universal Magnetic b-boy, scientific 
 Like that, and you don't stop 
 It go onto the rhythm you don't stop 
 Now raise your hands in the air everybody get wit it 
 The Universal Magnetic in a b-boy stance"
127,Mos Def,hiphop,Very Well,"So what you doing 
 I'm feeling very well 
 Rocking this from Brooklyn, this is my vibration 
 Make you have sensation, when you hear the jam 
 All you want to say is happiness yo 
 Sometimes I get a feeling inside it's like (what) 
 It's something type of hard to explain it's like (what) 
 I got a good vocab and such but Ock 
 Somethings still remain out of touch- it's like 
 Your very first kiss or- it's like 
 Like a new pair of kicks or 
 You know what I'm saying Ock 
 It's just the vide 
 I can't articulate it 
 It's better demonstrated 
 And when it's integrated 
 Then things get renovated 
 It's deeply contemplated 
 Before I operated 
 My steady advance will keep the jams populated 
 Okay okay I'm ready, (all right) I'm feeling good 
 Beats by 88 Key, Mos Def the emcee 
 The HOTtest entry, inside your benzy 
 Yo they got digitals now, true 
 That's old school 
 Don't run no new game, I like the old rules- like 
 Early to sleep and early to wake 
 You keep your long on money and short on mistakes 
 I speak on beat breaks, my jams is keep sakes 
 So recite that (cite that) 
 I said recite that (CITE that) 
 'Cause when I'm laying down here baby it's tight phat 
 When I react that ain't no army that can strike back 
 And if they do they catching more than the eye jab (poof) 
 A lot of cats like to bite, I copyright that 
 So when you hear it on your box you say ""I like that"" 
 Send salaams to Abstract, is this the right track? 
 We staying, underground like the NTA 
 Be controller of the rock like the NBA 
 I remember days when supper was the empty tray 
 But I still held it down for mines an-y-way 
 See I still held it down for mines an-y-way 
 See I still held it down for mines an-y-way 
 It's how we do say, 
 Hey man what you doing 
 Feeling very well 
 Rocking this from Brooklyn 
 This is my vibration 
 To make you have sensation 
 Family situation 
 When you hear the jam 
 All you want to say, is Happiness- yo 
 The era we entering is mad exciting 
 Sometimes I got more rhymes than I remember writing 
 I stand like a titan above the mental midget 
 My safe originate from seven-eighteen digits 
 That's BROOKLYN- for area code impaired 
 Medina of the planet for cats from out there 
 Mos Def official native of the Bed-Stuy section 
 I'm standing 5'10"" with the chocolate complextion 
 I keep the function moving in the right direction 
 I'm coming with the new to keep the next crew guessing 
 Who you stressing! Pump your brakes and slow down 
 I hold court, you get cut short like pronoun 
 I throw down just like Ali in Zyaire 
 I'm fresh from my feet to the roots in my hair 
 Kangol and Wallabees is some gear that I wear 
 Skid out to Chamber Street and I copped the fly pair 
 And I DARE- anyone of these new chaps 
 To step in the arena without they crew's back 
 Approahing the recital with titles you lose that 
 Send home a telegram to relay the news that the 
 M- for magnificant 
 O- praise omnipotent 
 S- for significant 
 D- for type different 
 E- for effic-ient 
 F- the fly fisherman 
 Netting everything from here to Lake Michigan 
 So all my people if you're out there listening 
 Give me a shout and let me know what you getting in 
 Some emcees ain't even worth mentioning 
 Let's congregate and compilate these Benjamins 
 We take the crown and break them down like divis-ion 
 To realize what my eyes is envisioning 
 Dollars correct and I'm the man on deck 
 But otherwise I gotta jet, it's no disrespect 
 Otherwise I gotta jet, it's no disrespect 
 Otherwise I gotta jet, it's no disrespect 
 Otherwise I gotta jet, it's no disrespect 
 Hey man what you doing 
 Feeling very well 
 Rocking this from Brooklyn 
 This is my vibration 
 To make you have sensation 
 Family situation 
 When you hear the jam 
 All you want to say, is Happiness"
128,Mos Def,hiphop,What's Beef?,"(Talib Kweli) 
 Yo I was sold to a sick European by a rich African battlin' 
 Middle Passages, I can't go back again 
 Battlin' years of denyin' history, lies and mysteries 
 Wives with misty eyes watchin' their niggas be beaten viciously 
 Battle in the wilderness of North America 
 Ran by the river, only stoppin' to pray 
 Chased by predators 
 Terrorists with etiquette who vote and kill their president 
 Their capacity for evil so evident and prevalent 
 Ain't no hesitation involved, a nation dissolved 
 While we sit back waitin' to evolve 
 Those who would trade in their freedom 
 For their protection deserve neither 
 Fuck a name, fuck tradition 
 Religion - you learn Jesus 
 Turn the other cheek 
 Inherit the Earth, just stay meek 
 Fuck the way you speak 
 Try to walk, we chop off your feet 
 Fastforward to 2003, niggas beef 
 The psychology of children are slaves to run deep 
 (Mos Def and Talib Kweli) 
 Hell yeah, hell yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yo 
 What's beef? hell yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yo 
 That's beef, hell yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yo 
 It's always your own peoples 
 Sometimes it's your own peoples yo 
 Yeah yeah, hell yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yo 
 What's beef? hell yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yo 
 That's beef, hell yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yo 
 It's always your own peoples 
 Sometimes it's your own peoples yo 
 (Mos Def) 
 Beef is not what Jay said to Nas 
 Beef is when workin' niggas can't find jobs 
 So they tryna find niggas to rob 
 Tryna find bigger guns so they can finish the job 
 Beef is when the crack kids can't find moms 
 'Cause they end up inna PINE box or locked behind bars 
 Beef ain't the Summer Jam for Hot 97 
 Beef is the cocaine and AIDS epidemic 
 Beef don't come with a radio edit 
 Beef is when the judge is callin' you ""defendant"" 
 Beef, it comes with a long jail sentence 
 Handed down to you in a few short minutes 
 Beef is when your girl come through for a visit 
 Talkin' bout ""I'm pregnant by some other nigga"" 
 Beef is high blood pressure and bad credit 
 Need a loan for your home and you're too broke to get it 
 And all your little kids is doin' is gettin' bigger 
 You tryin' not to raise 'em around these wild niggas 
 Beef is when a gold digger got ya seat and a 
 A manicured hand out like ""pay me nigga"" 
 Or I'm tellin' your wife 
 Or startin' up some foul rumor that'll ruin your life 
 Beef is when a gangster ain't doin' it right 
 Another gangster then decided what to do with his life 
 Beef is not what these famous niggas do on the mic 
 Beef is what George Bush would do in a fight 
 Yeah, beef is not what Ja said to 50 
 Beef is more than Irv not bein here with me 
 When a soldier ends his life with his own gun 
 Beef is tryin' to figure out what to tell his son 
 Beef is oil prices and geopolitics 
 Beef is Iraq, the West Bank, and Gaza Strip 
 Some beef is big and some beef is small 
 But what y'all call beef is not beef at all 
 Beef is real life happenin' everyday 
 And it's realer than them songs that you get at Kay Slay 
 This has been a Black Star PSA 
 From Mos Def, Pretty Flocko, black Dante 
 And the Black Star embassy, B to the K"
129,Mos Def,hiphop,Wylin Out,"(Feat. Diverse, Prefuse 73) 
 (Diverse) 
 My mind compliance like a science 
 Analyze my data, not a fader on the face of the earth 
 Can blend rhythms like my will, surreal spinnin 
 Ever-movin like evolution it's retribution 
 For sellin roots, lessen futures, I'm steppin to fuse? ya 
 Sun rises my subconsciousness culminates constant 
 Live to see various i-de-ologies, angles like isosceles 
 Read my auto-b-i-ography 
 So many stars? to me that vibrantly shine 
 Velocity's properly thick like mahogany dimes 
 We findin beauty in this urban-gritty usually overlooked by many 
 Movin through the densely populated city 
 And soon and eventually - 'we gotta get ova' 
 I document culture closer to the edge 
 Bolder than a print, open to interpretation, gazin deep into the 
 Glitz? 
 To my people, raise you fists 
 I know it stays intent, whatever pays your rent, but saves your 
 Soul 
 You know the drill, it go: 
 (Mos and Diverse simultaneously) 
 Hotter than most dudes 
 From left to right, on top and below you 
 Flow like the coastals, move like smoke do 
 -I'm Diverse- these other cats is just hopefuls 
 When they ask who put it down, baby, you know who 
 Tell your whole crew, it's somethin' that you need to know, dude 
 This is how we go through 
 (Mos) 
 Who the poisoned pen? 
 Mos got the inkwell full of syrum 
 Prescribed for any emcee claimin they ill 
 A small dose'll change the way that they feel 
 Milligrams in the raw, snow-cut, check how I label the pill 
 It's MD, the spit-doctor, chant like a witch-doctor 
 Recite me, and ya whole ailment get proper 
 I'm the, medicine man, representin my clan 
 Mixin the potion with verse fire and simmer, my man 
 And stay shoutin out the home team wherever I am: 
 It's the B-R-O double akh-K-L-wY-liN out 
 The cowboys who don't fret to pull they lamas? out 
 Ironhorse style cab?, hoop-te ville ridin' out 
 No lights, no cam, action - drama'd out 
 ?? Out, absorb the shit that I'm about 
 Inner-city Bruno, ghetto folks, holla out 
 I'm good money, tell the doubters get they wallets out 
 Hot when the dice is out, they go broke findin out 
 Smack ya mojo, caught a half of 'oh no' 
 Magical vocals, get it down like coastals? 
 Underground nigga that spoke truth and broke through 
 Shine bright when I'm far from my close-to 
 I told you, you know how Mos do 
 Hotter than most dudes 
 From left to right, on top and below you 
 Flow like the coastals, move like smoke do 
 -I'm Mos Def- them other cats is just hopefuls 
 When they ask who put it down, baby, you know who 
 Tell your whole crew, it's somethin' that you need to know, dude 
 This is how we go through 
 (Diverse) 
 Exposed to a higher set of variables, as fly as aerial 
 Definin stereo components, moments with my master 
 Remasterin techniques, havin' some fresh sheets 
 Damagin margins with a broader outlook - 'we lookin' out, y'all' 
 Me and Mr. Mighty Mos, we outlaws 
 Blazin' in the saddle, raisin like the mornin star, formin 
 Majestic 
 Candescent like the street lamps, I-be-amped to inn-o-vate 
 Reminiscent of technology, probably just my will to build 
 To real notions of emotions similar to the seven seas 
 Steadily sparkin cables, tables turnin' like the high tide 
 I'm captive to this music, vastness, into it I skydive 
 Tumblin like buildings crumblin on inner-cities cumbersome 
 They comin' to run us out, my niggas shout for justice 
 You wanna link with me, then let me know 
 This music is like my vessel so we seem to be inseparable 
 From C-?Sea?-town, headed eastbound 
 You know the rest, it go: 
 Hotter than most dudes 
 From left to right, on top and below you 
 Flow like the coastals, move like smoke do 
 -It's D-I- these other cats is just hopefuls 
 When they ask who put it down, baby, you know who 
 Tell your whole crew, it's somethin' that you need to know, dude 
 This is how we go through"
