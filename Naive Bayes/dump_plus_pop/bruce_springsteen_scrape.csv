0,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Blinded By The Light,"Madman drummers bummers and Indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat 
 In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat 
 With a boulder on my shoulder, feelin' kinda older, I tripped the merry-go-round 
 With this very unpleasing sneezing and wheezing, the calliope crashed to the ground 
 Some all-hot half-shot was headin' for a hot spot, snappin' his fingers, clappin' his hands 
 And some fleshpot mascot was tied into a lover's knot with a whatnot in her hand 
 And now young Scott with a slingshot finally found the tender spot and throws his lover in the sand 
 And some bloodshot forget-me-not whispers ""Daddy's within earshot,"" save the buckshot, turn up the band 
 And she was blinded by the light 
 Oh, cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night 
 Blinded by the light 
 She got down, but she never got tight 
 But she'll make it all right 
 Some brimstone baritone anti-cyclone rolling stone preacher from the east 
 He says, ""Dethrone the Dictaphone, hit it in its funny bone, that's where they expect it least"" 
 And some new-mown chaperone standin' in the corner all alone watchin' the young girls dance 
 And some fresh-sown moonstone was messin' with his frozen zone to remind him of the feeling of romance 
 Yeah, he was blinded by the light 
 Oh, cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night 
 Blinded by the light 
 He got down, but he never got tight 
 But he's gonna make it 
 Tonight 
 Some silicone sister with her manager's mister told me I got what it takes 
 She said, ""I'll turn you on, sonny, to something strong if you'll play that song with the funky break"" 
 And go-kart Mozart was checkin' out the weather chart to see if it was safe to go outside 
 And little Early-Pearly came by in her curly-wurly and asked me if I needed a ride 
 Oh, some hazard from Harvard was skunked on beer playin' backyard bombardier 
 Yes, and Scotland Yard was trying hard 
 They sent some dude with a calling card 
 He said, ""Do what you like, but don't do it here"" 
 Well I jumped up, turned around, spit in the air, fell on the ground 
 Asked him which was the way back home 
 He said, ""Take a right at the light, keep goin' straight until night 
 And then, boys, you're on your own"" 
 And now in Zanzibar a shootin' star was ridin' in a sidecar hummin' a lunar tune 
 Yes, and the avatar said, ""Blow the bar, but first remove the cookie jar, we're gonna teach those boys to laugh too soon"" 
 And some kidnapped handicap was complainin' that he caught the clap from some mousetrap he bought last night 
 Well, I unsnapped his skull cap and between his ears I saw a gap and figured he'd be all right 
 He was just blinded by the light 
 Cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night 
 Blinded by the light 
 Mama always told me not to look into the sights of the sun 
 Whoa, but, Mama, that's where the fun is 
 Ooh, yeah 
 (I was blinded) Whoa, but, Mama, whoa, but, Mama 
 (I was blinded) Whoa, but, Mama 
 (I was blinded) I was blinded by the light 
 (I was blinded) I was blinded by the light 
 (I was blinded) I was blinded by the light 
 (I was blinded) I was blinded 
 (I was blinded) 
 (I was blinded)"
1,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Growin' Up,"Well I stood stone-like at midnight 
 Suspended in my masquerade 
 And I combed my hair 'til it was just right 
 And commanded the night brigade 
 I was open to pain 
 And crossed by the rain 
 And I walked on a crooked crutch 
 I strolled all alone 
 Through a fallout zone 
 Came out with my soul untouched 
 I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd 
 When they said, ""Sit down,"" I stood up 
 Ooh-ooh, growin' up 
 And the flag of piracy flew from my mast 
 My sails were set wing to wing 
 I had a jukebox graduate for first mate 
 She couldn't sail but she sure could sing 
 And I pushed B-52 
 And bombed 'em with the blues 
 With my gear set stubborn on standing 
 I broke all the rules 
 Strafed my old high school 
 Never once gave thought to landing 
 I hid in the clouded warmth of the crowd 
 But when they said, ""Come down,"" I threw up 
 Ooh-ooh, growin' up 
 I took month long vacations in the stratosphere 
 And you know it's really hard to hold your breath 
 Swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared 
 I was a cosmic kid in full costume dress 
 Well, my feet they finally took root in the earth 
 But I got me a nice little place in the stars 
 And I swear I found the key to the universe 
 In the engine of an old parked car 
 I hid in the mother breast of the crowd 
 When they said, ""Pull down,"" I pulled up 
 Ooh-ooh, growin' up 
 Ooh-ooh, growin' up 
 Oh"
2,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Mary Queen Of Arkansas,"Mary Queen of Arkansas, it's not too early for dreamin' 
 The sky is grown with cloud seed sown and a bastard's love can be redeeming 
 Mary, my queen, your soft hulk is reviving 
 No, you're not too late to desecrate, the servants are just rising 
 Well I'm just a lonely acrobat, the live wire is my trade 
 I've been a shine boy for your acid brat and a wharf rat of your state 
 Mary, my queen, your blows for freedom are missing 
 You're not man enough for me to hate or woman enough for kissing 
 The big top is for dreamers, we can take the circus all the way to the border 
 And the gallows wait for martyrs whose papers are in order 
 But I was not born to live to die and you were not born for queenin' 
 It's not too late to infiltrate, the servants are just leavin' 
 Mary queen of Arkansas, your white skin is deceivin' 
 You wake and wait to lie in bait and you almost got me believin' 
 But on your bed Mary I can see the shadow of a noose 
 I don't understand how you can hold me so tight and love me so damn loose 
 But I know a place where we can go Mary 
 Where I can get a good job and start all over again clean 
 I got contacts deep in Mexico where the servants have been seen"
3,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street?,"Hey bus driver, keep the change 
 Bless your children, give them names 
 Don't trust men who walk with canes 
 Drink this and you'll grow wings on your feet 
 Broadway Mary, Joan Fontaine 
 Advertiser on the downtown train 
 Christmas Crier bustin' cane hes in love again 
 Well dock workers dreams 
 Mixed with panther schemes 
 To some day own the rodeo 
 Tainted women in Vistivision 
 Perform for out of state kids at the late show 
 Wizard imps and sweat sock pimps 
 Interstellar mongrel nymphs 
 Rex said his lady left him limp 
 Well love's like that, sure it is 
 Well now queen of diamonds ace of spades 
 Newly discovered lovers of the everglades 
 Take out a full page ad in the trades 
 To announce their arrival 
 And Mary Lou found out how to cope 
 She rides to heaven on a gyroscope 
 The daily news asks her for the dope 
 She says man the dope's that there's still hope 
 Sinorita Spanish rose 
 Wipes her eyes and blows her nose 
 Uptown in harlem she throws a rose 
 To some lucky young matador"
4,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Lost In The Flood,"The ragamuffin gunner is returnin' home like a hungry runaway 
 He walks through town all alone 
 He must be from the fort he hears the high school girls say 
 His countryside's burnin' with wolfman fairies dressed in drag for homicide 
 The hit and run, plead sanctuary, 'neath a holy stone they hide 
 They're breakin' beams and crosses with a spastic's reelin' perfection 
 Nuns run bald through Vatican halls pregnant, pleadin' immaculate conception 
 And everybody's wrecked on Main Street from drinking unholy blood 
 Sticker smiles sweet as gunner breathes deep, his ankles caked in mud 
 And I said ""Hey, gunner man, that's quicksand, that's quicksand that ain't mud 
 Have you thrown your senses to the war or did you lose them in the flood?"" 
 That pure American brother, dull-eyed and empty-faced 
 Races Sundays in Jersey in a Chevy stock super eight 
 He rides 'er low on the hip, on the side he's got Bound For Glory in red, white and blue flash paint 
 He leans on the hood telling racing stories, the kids call him Jimmy The Saint 
 Well the blaze and noise boy, he's gunnin' that bitch loaded to blastin' point 
 He rides head first into a hurricane and disappears into a point 
 And there's nothin' left but some blood where the body fell 
 That is, nothin' left that you could sell 
 Just junk all across the horizon, a real highwayman's farewell 
 And he said ""Hey kid, you think that's oil? Man, that ain't oil that's blood"" 
 I wonder what he was thinking when he hit that storm 
 Or was he just lost in the flood? 
 Eighth Avenue sailors in satin shirts they whisper in the air 
 Some storefront incarnation of Maria, she's puttin' on me the stare 
 And Bronx's best apostle stands with his hand on his own hardware 
 Everything stops, you hear five, quick shots, the cops come up for air 
 And now the whiz-bang gang from uptown, they're shootin' up the street 
 And that cat from the Bronx starts lettin' loose 
 And gets blown right off his feet 
 And some kid comes blastin' round the corner but a cop puts him right away 
 He lays on the street holding his leg screaming something in Spanish 
 He still breathing when I walked away 
 And somebody said ""Hey man did you see that? His body hit the street with such a beautiful thud"" 
 I wonder what that dude was sayin' or was he just lost in the flood? 
 They said ""Hey man, did you see that, those poor cats are sure messed up"" 
 I wonder what they were gettin' into, or were they just lost in the flood?"
5,Bruce Springsteen,rock,The Angel,"The angel rides with hunch-backed children, poison oozing from his engine 
 Wieldin' love as a lethal weapon, on his way to hubcap heaven 
 Baseball cards poked in his spokes, his boots in oil he's patiently soaked 
 The roadside attendant nervously jokes as the angel's tires strokes his precious pavement 
 The interstate's choked with nomadic hordes 
 In Volkswagen vans with full running boards dragging great anchors 
 Followin' dead-end signs into the sores 
 The angel rides by humpin' his hunk metal whore 
 Madison Avenue's claim to fame in a trainer bra with eyes like rain 
 She rubs against the weather-beaten frame and asks the angel for his name 
 Off in the distance the marble dome 
 Reflects across the flatlands with a naked feel off into parts unknown 
 The woman strokes his polished chrome and lies beside the angel's bones."
6,Bruce Springsteen,rock,For You,"Princess cards she sends me with her regards 
 Oh barroom eyes shine vacancy, to see her you gotta look hard 
 Wounded deep in battle, I stand stuffed like some soldier undaunted 
 To her Cheshire smile I'll stand on file, she's all I ever wanted 
 Oh but you let your blue walls get in the way of these facts 
 Honey, get your carpetbaggers off my back 
 You wouldn't even give me time to cover my tracks 
 You said, ""Here's your mirror and your ball and jacks"" 
 But they're not what I came for, and I'm sure you see that too 
 I came for you, for you, I came for you, but you did not need my urgency 
 I came for you, for you, I came for you, but your life was one long emergency 
 And your cloud line urges me 
 Oh and my electric surges free 
 Oh crawl into my ambulance, your pulse is getting weak 
 Oh reveal yourself all now to me girl while you've got the strength to speak 
 'Cause they're waiting for you at Bellevue with their oxygen masks 
 But I could give it all to you now if only you could ask 
 Oh and don't call for your surgeon even he says it's too late 
 It's not your lungs this time, it's your heart that holds your fate 
 Don't give me my money, honey, I don't want it back 
 You and your pony face and your Union Jack 
 Well take your local joker and teach him how to act 
 I swear I was never that way even when I really cracked 
 Didn't you think I knew that you were born with the power of a locomotive 
 Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound? 
 And your Chelsea suicide with no apparent motive 
 You could laugh and cry in a single sound, alright 
 And your strength is devastating in the face of all these odds 
 Remember how I kept you waiting when it was my turn to be the god? 
 You were not quite half so proud when I found you broken on the beach 
 Remember how I poured salt on your tongue and hung just out of reach 
 And the band they played the homecoming theme as I caressed your cheek 
 Yeah that ragged, jagged melody, she still clings to me like a leach 
 But that medal you wore on your chest always got in the way 
 Like a little girl with a trophy so soft to buy her way 
 We were both hitchhikers but you had your ears tuned to the roar 
 Of some metal-tempered engine on an alien, distant shore 
 So you left to find a better reason than the one we were living for 
 And it's not that nursery mouth I came back for 
 It's not the way you're stretched out on the floor 
 'Cause I've broken all your windows and I've rammed through all your doors 
 And who am I to ask you to lick my sores? 
 And you should know that's true 
 I came for you, for you, I came for you, but you did not need my urgency 
 I came for you, for you, I came for you, but your life was one long emergency 
 And your cloud line urges me 
 Oh and my electric surges free 
 Ooh"
7,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Spirit In The Night,"Crazy Janey and her Mission Man 
 Were back in the alley tradin' hands 
 'Long came Wild Billy with his friend, G-Man 
 All duded up for Saturday night 
 Well Billy slammed on his coaster brakes 
 And said, ""Anybody wanna go on up to Greasy Lake? 
 It's about a mile down on the dark side of Route 88 
 I got a bottle of rose, so let's try it 
 ""We'll pick up Hazy Davy and Killer Joe 
 And I'll take you all out to where the gypsy angels go 
 They're built like light 
 Ooh, and they dance like spirits in the night"" 
 In the night 
 Oh, you don't know what they can do to ya 
 Spirits in the night 
 Oh, in the night 
 Stand right up now and let it shoot through ya 
 Well now wild young Billy was a crazy cat 
 And he shook some dust out of his coonskin cap 
 He said, ""Trust some of this, it'll show you where you're at 
 Or at least it'll help you really feel it"" 
 Well by the time we made it up to Greasy Lake 
 I had my head out the window and Janey's fingers were in the cake 
 I think I really dug her, 'cause I was to loose to fake 
 I said, ""I'm hurt,"" she said, ""Honey, let me heal it"" 
 And we danced all night to a soul fairy band 
 And she kissed me just right like only a lonely angel can 
 She felt so nice 
 Just as soft as a spirit in the night 
 In the night 
 Oh, Janey don't know what she do to ya 
 Like a spirit in the night 
 All night 
 Stand right up now and let it shoot through me 
 Well now the night was bright and the stars threw light 
 On Billy and Davy dancing in the moonlight 
 They were down near the water having a stoned mud fight 
 Killer Joe gone passed out on the lawn 
 Well now Hazy Davy got really hurt 
 He ran into the lake in just his socks and a shirt 
 Me and Crazy Janey was makin' love in the dirt 
 Singin' our birthday song 
 Janey said it was time to go 
 So we closed our eyes and said goodbye to gypsy angel row 
 Felt so right 
 Together we moved like spirits in the night 
 In the night 
 Oh you don't know what they can do to ya 
 Them spirits in the night 
 All night 
 Oh stand right up and let it shoot through ya 
 Like a spirit in the night 
 All night 
 All night 
 All night 
 All night 
 All night 
 All night

8,Bruce Springsteen,rock,It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City,"I had skin like leather and the diamond-hard look of a cobra 
 I was born blue and weathered but I burst just like a supernova 
 I could walk like Brando right into the sun 
 Then dance just like a Casanova 
 With my blackjack and jacket and hair slicked sweet 
 Silver star studs on my duds like a Harley in heat 
 When I strut down the street I could feel its heartbeat 
 The sisters fell back and said, ""Don't that man look pretty"" 
 The cripple on the corner cried out, ""Nickels for your pity"" 
 Them gasoline boys downtown sure talk gritty 
 It's so hard to be a saint in the city 
 I was the king of the alley, mama, I could talk some trash 
 I was the prince of the paupers crowned downtown at the beggar's bash 
 I was the pimp's main prophet I kept everything cool 
 Just a backstreet gambler with the luck to lose 
 And when the heat came down and it was left on the ground 
 The devil appeared like Jesus through the steam in the street 
 Showing me a hand I knew even the cops couldn't beat 
 I felt his hot breath on my neck as I dove into the heat 
 It's so hard to be a saint when you're just a boy out on the street 
 And the sages of the subway sit just like the living dead 
 As the tracks clack out the rhythm their eyes fixed straight ahead 
 They ride the line of balance and hold on by just a thread 
 But it's too hot in these tunnels you can get hit up by the heat 
 You get up to get out at your next stop but they push you back down in your seat 
 Your heart starts beating faster as you struggle to your feet 
 Then you're out of that hole and back up on the street 
 And them South Side sisters sure look pretty 
 The cripple on the corner cries out, ""Nickels for your pity"" 
 Them downtown boys, they sure talk gritty 
 It's so hard to be a saint in the city 
 ..."
9,Bruce Springsteen,rock,The E Street Shuffle,"Sparks fly on E Street when the boy prophets walk it handsome and hot 
 All the little girls' souls go weak when the man-child gives them a double shot 
 The schoolboy pops pull out all the stops on a Friday night 
 The teenage tramps in skintight pants do the E Street dance and everything's alright 
 And the kids down there, either dancing or hooked up in a scuffle 
 Dressed in snakeskin suits, packed with Detroit muscle 
 They're doing the E Street shuffle 
 Now those E Street brats in twilight duel flashlight phantoms in full star stream 
 Down fire trails on silver nights with blonde girls pledged sweet sixteen 
 The newsboys say the heat's been bad since Power Thirteen gave a trooper all he had in a summer scuffle 
 And Power's girl, Little Angel, been on the corner keeping those crazy boys out of trouble 
 Little Angel steps the shuffle like she ain't got no brains 
 She's deaf in combat down on Lover's Lane 
 She drives all them local boys insane 
 Yes, she does 
 Little Angel says, ""Oh, oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, everybody form a line"" 
 When the sparks fly on E Street when the boy prophets walk it handsome and hot 
 All them little girls' souls go weak when the man-child gives them a double shot 
 Oh, Little Angel hangs out at Easy Joe's, it's a club where all the riot squad goes when they're cashing in for a cheap hustle 
 But them boys are still on the corner loose and doing that lazy E Street shuffle 
 And as them sweet summer nights turn into summer dreams 
 Little Angel picks up Power and he slips on his jeans 
 And they move on out down to the scene 
 All the kids are dancing"
10,Bruce Springsteen,rock,"4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)","Sandy, the fireworks are hailin' over Little Eden tonight 
 Forcin' a light into all those stony faces left stranded on this warm July 
 Down in the town, the circuit's full of switchblade lovers, so fast, so shiny, and so sharp 
 And the wizards play down on Pinball Way on the boardwalk way past dark 
 And the boys from the casino dance with their shirts open like Latin lovers on the shore 
 Chasin' all them silly New York virgins by the score 
 And, Sandy, the aurora is risin' behind us 
 These pier lights, our carnival life forever 
 Oh, love me tonight for I may never see you again 
 Hey, Sandy, girl 
 My, my baby 
 Now the greasers, ah, they tramp the streets or get busted for sleeping on the beach all night 
 Them boys in their high heels, ah, Sandy, their skins are so white 
 And me, I just got tired of hangin' in them dusty arcades, bangin' them pleasure machines 
 Chasin' the factory girls underneath the boardwalk where they all promise to unsnap their jeans 
 And you know that tilt-a-whirl down on the South Beach drag? 
 I got on it last night and my shirt got caught 
 And they kept me spinnin', babe, didn't think I'd ever get off 
 Oh, Sandy, the aurora is risin' behind us 
 This pier lights our carnival life on the water 
 Runnin' laughin' 'neath the boardwalk, ah, with the boss's daughter 
 Ah, remember, Sandy, girl 
 My, my, my, my, my baby 
 Sandy, that waitress I was seein' lost her desire for me 
 I spoke with her last night, she said she won't set herself on fire for me anymore 
 She worked that joint under the boardwalk, she was always the girl you saw boppin' down the beach with the radio 
 The kids say last night she was dressed like a star in one of them cheap little seaside bars 
 And I saw her parked with lover boy out on the Kokomo 
 Did you hear the cops finally busted Madame Marie for tellin' fortunes better than they do? 
 For me, this boardwalk life's through, babe, you ought to quit this scene, too 
 Sandy, the aurora is rising behind us 
 This pier lights our carnival life forever 
 Oh, love me tonight, and I promise I'll love you forever 
 Oh, I mean it, Sandy, girl 
 My, my, my, my, my baby 
 Yeah, I promise, Sandy, girl 
 Sha-la-la-la-la, baby"
11,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Kitty's Back,"Catlong sighs holding Kitty's black tooth 
 She left to marry some top cat, ain't it the cold truth 
 And there hasn't been a tally since Sally left the alley 
 Since Kitty left with Big Pretty things have got pretty thin 
 It's tight on this fence since them young dudes are musclin' in 
 Jack Knife cries 'cause baby's in a bundle 
 She goes running nightly, lightly through the jungle 
 And them tin cans are explodin' out in the ninety-degree heat 
 Cat somehow lost his baby down on Bleecker Street 
 It's sad but it sure is true 
 Cat shrugs his shoulders, sits back and sighs 
 Ooh, what can I do, ooh, what can I do? 
 Ooh, what can I do, ooh what can I do? 
 Catlong lies back bent on a trash can, 
 Flashing lights cut the night, dude in the white says he's the man 
 Well you better learn to move fast when you're young or you're not long around 
 Cat somehow lost his Kitty down in the city pound 
 So get right, get tight, get down 
 Well who's that down at the end of the alley? 
 She's been gone so long 
 Kitty's back in town, here she comes now 
 Kitty's back in town 
 Kitty's back in town, here she comes now 
 Kitty's back in town 
 Kitty's back in town, here she comes now 
 Kitty's back in town 
 Now Cat knows his Kitty's been untrue 
 And that she left him for a city dude 
 But she's so soft, she's so blue 
 When he looks into her eyes 
 He just sits back and sighs 
 Ooh, what can I do, ooh, what can I do?"
12,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Wild Billy's Circus Story,"The machinist climbs his ferris wheel like a brave 
 And the fire eater's lyin' in a pool of sweat, victim of the heatwave 
 Behind the tent the hired hand tightens his legs on the sword swallower's blade 
 And circus town's on the shortwave 
 The runway lies ahead like a great false dawn 
 Fat lady, big mama, Missy Bimbo sits in her chair and yawns 
 And the man-beast lies in his cage sniffin' popcorn 
 As the midget licks his fingers and suffers Missy Bimbo's scorn 
 Circus town's been born 
 Whoa, and a press roll drummer go, ballerina to and fro 
 Cartwheelin' up on that tightrope with a cannon blast lightin' flash 
 Movin' fast through the tent Mars bent, he's gonna miss his fall 
 Oh God save the human cannonball. 
 And the flying Zambinis watch Margarita do her neck twist, 
 And the ringmaster gets the crowd to count along: ""Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven"" 
 A ragged suitcase in his hand, he steals silently away from the circus grounds 
 And the highway's haunted by the carnival sounds 
 They dance like a great greasepaint ghost on the wind 
 A man in baggy pants, a lonely face, a crazy grin 
 Runnin' home to some small Ohio town 
 Jesus send some good women to save all your clowns 
 And circus boy dances like a monkey on barbed wire 
 And the barker romances with a junkie, she's got a flat tire, 
 And now the elephants dance real funky and the band plays like a jungle fire 
 Circus town's on the live wire 
 And the strong man Sampson lifts the midget little Tiny Tim way up on his shoulders, way up 
 And carries him on down the midway past the kids, past the sailors 
 To his dimly lit trailer 
 And the ferris wheel turns and turns like it ain't ever gonna stop 
 And the circus boss leans over, whispers into the little boy's ear ""Hey son, you want to try the big top?"" 
 All aboard, Nebraska's our next stop."
13,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Incident On 57th Street,"Spanish Johnny drove in from the underworld last night 
 With bruised arms and broken rhythm in a beat-up old Buick 
 But dressed just like dynamite 
 He tried sellin' his heart to the hard girls over on Easy Street 
 But they sighed ""Johnny it falls apart so easy and you know hearts these days are cheap"" 
 And the pimps swung their axes and said ""Johnny you're a cheater"" 
 Well the pimps swung their axes and said ""Johnny you're a liar"" 
 And from out of the shadows came a young girl's voice saying ""Johnny don't cry"" 
 Puerto Rican Jane, oh won't you tell me what's your name 
 I want to drive you down to the other side of town where paradise ain't so crowded, there'll be action goin' down on Shanty Lane tonight 
 All them golden-heeled fairies in a real bitch fight 
 Pull .38s and kiss the girls good night 
 Oh good night, it's all right Jane 
 Now let them black boys in to light the soul flame 
 We may find it out on the street tonight baby 
 Or we may walk until the daylight maybe 
 Well like a cool Romeo he made his moves, oh she looked so fine 
 Like a late Juliet she knew he'd never be true but then she didn't really mind 
 Upstairs a band was playin', the singer was singin' something about goin' home 
 She whispered ""Spanish Johnny, you can leave me tonight but just don't leave me alone"" 
 And Johnny cried ""Puerto Rican Jane, word is down the cops have found the vein"" 
 Oh all them barefoot boys they left their homes for the woods 
 Them little barefoot street boys they say homes ain't no good 
 They left the corners, threw away all their switchblade knives and kissed each other good-bye 
 Johnny was sittin' on the fire escape watchin' the kids playin' down the street 
 He called down ""Hey little heroes, summer's long but I guess it ain't very sweet around here anymore"" 
 Janey sleeps in sheets damp with sweat, Johnny sits up alone and watches her dream on, dream on 
 And the sister prays for lost souls, then breaks down in the chapel after everyone's gone 
 Jane moves over to share her pillow but opens her eyes to see Johnny up and puttin' his clothes on 
 She says ""Those romantic young boys 
 All they ever want to do is fight"" 
 Those romantic young boys 
 They're callin' through the window 
 ""Hey Spanish Johnny, you want to make a little easy money tonight?"" 
 And Johnny whispered: 
 Good night, it's all tight Jane 
 I'll meet you tomorrow night on Lover's Lane 
 We may find it out on the street tonight baby 
 Or we may walk until the daylight maybe"

 Rosalita you're my stone desire 
 Now I know your mama she don't like me 'cause I play in a rock and roll band 
 And I know your daddy he don't dig me but he never did understand 
 Your papa lowered the boom he locked you in your room 
 I'm comin' to lend a hand 
 I'm comin' to liberate you, confiscate you, I want to be your man 
 Someday we'll look back on this and it will all seem funny 
 But now you're sad, your mama's mad 
 And your papa says he knows that I don't... 
 (...Have any money) 
 Oh, your papa says he knows... 
 (...That I don't have any money) 
 Oh, so your daddy says he knows that I don't have... 
 (...Any money) 
 Well, tell him this is last chance 
 To get his daughter in a fine romance 
 Because a record company Rosie just gave me a big advance 
 And my tires were slashed and I almost crashed but the Lord had mercy 
 And my machine she's a dud out stuck in the mud somewhere in the swamps of Jersey 
 Well, hold on tight, stay up all night 'cause Rosie I'm comin' on strong 
 By the time we meet the morning light I will hold you in my arms 
 I know a pretty little place in Southern California down San Diego way 
 There's a little cafe where they play guitars all night and all day 
 You can hear them in the back room strummin' 
 So hold tight baby 'cause don't you know daddy's comin' 
 Rosalita jump a little lighter, 
 Senorita come sit by my fire 
 I just want to be your lover ain't no liar, 
 Rosalita you're my stone desire"
15,Bruce Springsteen,rock,New York City Serenade,"Billy, he's down by the railroad tracks 
 Sittin' low in the back seat of his Cadillac 
 Diamond Jackie, she's so intact 
 As she falls so softly beneath him 
 Jackie's heels are stacked 
 Billy's got cleats on his boots 
 Together they're gonna boogaloo down Broadway and come back home with the loot 
 It's midnight in Manhattan, this is no time to get cute 
 It's a mad dog's promenade, so walk tall 
 Or, baby, don't walk at all 
 Fish lady, oh, fish lady 
 Fish lady, she baits them tenement walls 
 She won't take corner boys 
 They ain't got no money and they're so easy 
 I said ""Hey, baby, won't you take my hand, walk with me down Broadway 
 Well, mama, take my arm and move with me down Broadway, yeah"" 
 I'm a young man, I talk it real loud 
 Yeah, babe, I walk it real proud for you 
 Ah, so shake it away 
 So shake away your street life 
 Shake away your city life 
 And hook up to the train 
 Ah, hook up to the night train 
 Hook it up 
 Hook up to the train 
 But I know that she won't take the train, no, she won't take the train 
 No, she won't take the train, no, she won't take the train 
 No, she won't take the train, no, she won't take the train 
 No, she won't take the train, no, she won't take the train 
 She's afraid them tracks are gonna slow her down 
 And when she turns, this boy'll be gone 
 So long 
 Sometimes, you just gotta walk on, walk on 
 Hey, vibes man, hey, jazz man, ah, play me a serenade 
 Any deeper blue and you're playin' in your grave 
 Save your notes, don't spend 'em on the blues, boy 
 Save your notes, don't spend 'em on the darlin' yearlin' sharp, boy 
 Straight for the church note ringin', 
 Vibes man, sting a trash can 
 Listen to your junk man 
 Listen to your junk man 
 Listen to your junk man 
 Listen to your junk man 
 He's singin' 
 He's singin' 
 He's singin' 
 All dressed up in satin, walkin' past the alley 
 Singin' 
 Singin' 
 Singin' 
 Singin' 
 Singin' 
 Singin'

16,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Thunder Road,"The screen door slams, Mary's dress sways 
 Like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays 
 Roy Orbison's singing for the lonely 
 Hey, that's me and I want you only 
 Don't turn me home again, I just can't face myself alone again 
 Don't run back inside, darling, you know just what I'm here for 
 So you're scared and you're thinking that maybe we ain't that young anymore 
 Show a little faith, there's magic in the night 
 You ain't a beauty, but hey, you're alright 
 Oh, and that's alright with me 
 You can hide 'neath your covers and study your pain 
 Make crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain 
 Waste your summer praying in vain 
 For a savior to rise from these streets 
 Well now, I'm no hero, that's understood 
 All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood 
 With a chance to make it good somehow 
 Hey, what else can we do now? 
 Except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair 
 Well, the night's busted open, these two lanes will take us anywhere 
 We got one last chance to make it real, to trade in these wings on some wheels 
 Climb in back, heaven's waiting down on the tracks 
 Oh, come take my hand 
 We're riding out tonight to case the promised land 
 Oh, Thunder Road, oh, Thunder Road 
 Oh, Thunder Road 
 Lying out there like a killer in the sun 
 Hey, I know it's late, we can make it if we run 
 Oh, Thunder Road, sit tight 
 Take hold, Thunder Road 
 Well, I got this guitar and I've learned how to make it talk 
 And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk 
 From your front porch to my front seat 
 The door's open but the ride ain't free 
 And I know you're lonely for words that I ain't spoken 
 Tonight we'll be free, all the promises will be broken 
 There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away 
 They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned out Chevrolets 
 They scream your name at night in the street 
 Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet 
 And in the lonely cool before dawn, you hear their engines roaring on 
 But when you get to the porch they're gone on the wind 
 So Mary climb in 
 It's a town full of losers, I'm pulling out of here to win"
17,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out,"Teardrops on the city, Bad Scooter searching for his groove 
 Seem like the whole world walking pretty and you can't find the room to move 
 Well, everybody better move over, that's all 
 'Cause I'm running on the bad side and I got my back to the wall 
 Tenth Avenue freeze-out 
 Tenth Avenue freeze-out 
 Well, I was stranded in the jungle trying to take in all the heat they was giving 
 The night is dark but the sidewalk's bright and lined with the light of the living 
 From a tenement window, a transistor blasts 
 Turn around the corner, things got real quiet real fast 
 I walked into a Tenth Avenue freeze-out 
 Tenth Avenue freeze-out 
 And I'm all alone, I'm all alone 
 And kid, you better get the picture 
 And I'm on my own, I'm on my own 
 And I can't go home 
 When the change was made uptown and the Big Man joined the band 
 From the coastline to the city all the little pretties raise their hands 
 I'm gonna sit back right easy and laugh 
 When Scooter and the Big Man bust this city in half 
 With a Tenth Avenue freeze-out 
 Tenth Avenue freeze-out 
 Tenth Avenue freeze-out 
 Tenth Avenue freeze-out"
18,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Night,"You get up every morning at the sound of the bell 
 You get to work late and the boss man's giving you hell 
 Till you're out on a midnight run 
 Losing your heart to a beautiful one 
 And it feels right 
 As you lock up the house 
 Turn out the lights 
 And step out into the night 
 And the world is busting at its seams 
 And you're just a prisoner of your dreams 
 Holding on for your life 
 'Cause you work all day to blow 'em away in the night 
 The rat traps filled with soul crusaders 
 The circuits lined and jammed with chromed invaders 
 And she's so pretty that you're lost in the stars 
 As you jockey your way through the cars 
 And sit at the light 
 As it changes to green 
 With your faith in your machine 
 Off you scream into the night 
 And you're in love with all the wonder it brings 
 And every muscle in your body sings as the highway ignites 
 You work nine to five 
 And somehow you survive till the night 
 Hell, all day they're busting you up on the outside 
 But tonight you're gonna break on through to the inside 
 And it'll be right, it'll be right 
 And it'll be tonight 
 And you know she will be waiting there 
 And you'll find her somehow, you swear somewhere tonight 
 You run sad and free 
 Until all you can see is the night"
19,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Backstreets,"One soft, infested summer me and Terry became friends 
 Trying in vain to breathe the fire we was born in 
 Catching rides to the outskirts, tying faith between our teeth 
 Sleeping in that old abandoned beach house, getting wasted in the heat 
 And hiding on the backstreets 
 Hiding on the backstreets 
 With a love so hard and filled with defeat 
 Running for our lives at night on them backstreets 
 Slow dancing in the dark on the beach at Stockton's Wing 
 Where desperate lovers park, we sat with the last of the Duke Street Kings 
 Huddled in our cars, waiting for the bells that ring 
 In the deep heart of the night we gonna let loose of everything 
 To go running on the backstreets 
 Running on the backstreets 
 Terry, you swore we'd live forever 
 Taking it on them backstreets together 
 Endless juke joints and Valentino drag 
 Where dancers scraped the tears up off the streets dressed down in rags 
 Running into the darkness, some hurt bad, some really dying 
 At night sometimes it seemed you could hear that whole damn city crying 
 Blame it on the lies that killed us, blame it on the truth that ran us down 
 You can blame it all on me, Terry, it don't matter to me now 
 When the breakdown hit at midnight, there was nothing left to say 
 But I hated him, and I hated you when you went away 
 Whoa, whoa 
 Laying here in the dark, you're like an angel on my chest 
 Just another tramp of hearts crying tears of faithlessness 
 Remember all the movies, Terry, we'd go see 
 Trying to learn how to walk like the heroes we thought we had to be 
 Well, after all this time, to find we're just like all the rest 
 Stranded in the park and forced to confess 
 To hiding on the backstreets 
 Hiding on the backstreets 
 Where we swore forever friends, hey 
 On the backstreets until the end 
 Hiding on the backstreets 
 Hiding on the backstreets 
 Hiding on the backstreets 
 Hiding on the backstreets 
 Hiding on the backstreets 
 Hiding on the backstreets 
 Hiding on the backstreets 
 Hiding on the backstreets 
 Hiding on the backstreets 
 Hiding on the backstreets 
 Hiding on the backstreets 
 Hiding on the backstreets 
 Hiding on the backstreets 
 Hiding on the backstreets 
 Hiding on the backstreets 
 Hiding on the backstreets 
 Hiding on the backstreets 
 Hiding on the backstreets 
 It was alright 
 We'll go hiding on the backstreets tonight 
 Hiding on the backstreets 
 Hiding on the backstreets 
 Hiding on the backstreets 
 Hiding on the backstreets 
 Hiding on the backstreets 
 Hiding on the backstreets 
 Hiding on the backstreets 
 Ho, yeah 
 Whoa

20,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Born To Run,"In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream 
 At night we ride through mansions of glory in suicide machines 
 Sprung from cages on Highway 9 
 Chrome-wheeled, fuel-injected and steppin' out over the line 
 Oh, baby, this town rips the bones from your back 
 It's a death trap 
 It's a suicide rap 
 We gotta get out while we're young 
 'Cause tramps like us 
 Baby, we were born to run 
 Yes, girl, we were 
 Wendy, let me in, I wanna be your friend 
 I wanna guard your dreams and visions 
 Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims 
 And strap your hands 'cross my engines 
 Together we could break this trap 
 We'll run 'til we drop, and baby, we'll never go back 
 Oh, will you walk with me out on the wire? 
 'Cause, baby, I'm just a scared and lonely rider 
 But I gotta know how it feels 
 I wanna know if love is wild 
 Babe, I wanna know if love is real 
 Oh, can you show me? 
 Beyond the palace 
 Hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard 
 Girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors 
 And the boys try to look so hard 
 The amusement park rises bold and stark 
 Kids are huddled on the beach in the mist 
 I wanna die with you, Wendy, on the street tonight 
 In an everlasting kiss, huh 
 One, two, three, four 
 The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive 
 Everybody's out on the run tonight, but there's no place left to hide 
 Together, Wendy, we can live with the sadness 
 I'll love you with all of the madness in my soul 
 Oh, someday, girl, I don't know when 
 We're gonna get to that place where we really wanna go 
 And we'll walk in the sun 
 But 'til then, tramps like us 
 Baby, we were born to run 
 Aw, honey, tramps like us 
 Baby, we were born to run 
 Come on, Wendy, tramps like us 
 Baby, we were born to run 
 Run 
 Mmm 
 Oh-oh-oh-oh 
 Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
 Mmm 
 Whoa 
 Oh 
 Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh"
21,Bruce Springsteen,rock,She's The One,"With her killer graces and her secret places 
 That no boy can fill 
 With her hands on her hips 
 Oh, and that smile on her lips because she knows that it kills me 
 With her soft French cream, standing in that doorway like a dream 
 I wish she'd just leave me alone 
 Because French cream won't soften them boots 
 And French kisses will not break that heart of stone 
 With her long hair falling 
 And her eyes that shine like a midnight sun 
 Oh, she's the one 
 She's the one 
 That thunder in your heart at night when you're kneeling in the dark 
 It says you're never gonna leave her 
 But there's this angel in her eyes that tells such desperate lies 
 And all you want to do is believe her 
 And tonight you'll try just one more time 
 To leave it all behind and to break on through 
 Oh she can take you but if she wants to break you 
 She's gonna find out that ain't so easy to do 
 And no matter where you sleep tonight 
 Or how far you run 
 Oh, she's the one 
 She's the one 
 Oh, and just one kiss, she'd fill them long summer nights 
 With her tenderness 
 That secret pact you made back when her love could save you 
 From the bitterness 
 Oh, she's the one 
 Oh, she's the one 
 Oh, she's the one 
 Oh, she's the one"
22,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Meeting Across The River,"Hey, Eddie, can you lend me a few bucks? 
 Tonight can you get us a ride? 
 Got to make it through the tunnel 
 Got a meeting with a man on the other side 
 Hey Eddie, this guy, he's the real thing 
 So if you want to come along, you gotta promise you won't say anything 
 'Cause this guy don't dance 
 And the word's been passed this is our last chance 
 We gotta stay cool tonight, Eddie 
 'Cause man, we got ourselves out on that line 
 And if we blow this one 
 They ain't gonna be looking for just me this time 
 And all we gotta do is hold up our end 
 Here, stuff this in your pocket, it'll look like you're carrying a friend 
 And remember, just don't smile 
 Change your shirt, 'cause tonight we got style 
 Well, Cherry says she's gonna walk 
 'Cause she found out I took her radio and hocked it 
 But Eddie, man, she don't understand 
 That two grand's practically sitting here in my pocket 
 And tonight's gonna be everything that I said 
 And when I walk through that door, I'm just gonna throw that money on the bed 
 She'll see this time I wasn't just talking 
 Then I'm gonna go out walking"
23,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Jungleland,"The rangers had a homecoming 
 In Harlem late last night 
 And the Magic Rat drove his sleek machine 
 Over the Jersey state line 
 Barefoot girl sitting on the hood of a Dodge 
 Drinking warm beer in the soft summer rain 
 The Rat pulls into town, rolls up his pants 
 Together they take a stab at romance and disappear down Flamingo Lane 
 Well, the Maximum Lawman run down Flamingo 
 Chasing the Rat and the barefoot girl 
 And the kids around here look just like shadows 
 Always quiet, holding hands 
 From the churches to the jails 
 Tonight all is silence in the world 
 As we take our stand 
 Down in Jungleland 
 The midnight gangs assembled 
 And picked a rendezvous for the night 
 They'll meet 'neath that giant Exxon sign 
 That brings this fair city light 
 Man, there's an opera out on the Turnpike 
 There's a ballet being fought out in the alley 
 Until the local cop's cherry top 
 Rips this holy night 
 The street's alive as secret debts are paid 
 Contacts made, they vanished unseen 
 Kids flash guitars just like switchblades 
 Hustling for the record machine 
 The hungry and the hunted 
 Explode into rock 'n' roll bands 
 That faced off against each other out in the street 
 Down in Jungleland 
 In the parking lot 
 The visionaries dress in the latest rage 
 Inside, the backstreet girls 
 Are dancing to the records that the DJ plays 
 Lonely hearted lovers struggle in dark corners 
 Desperate as the night moves on 
 With just one look and a whisper 
 They're gone 
 Beneath the city, two hearts beat 
 Soul engines running through a night so tender 
 In a bedroom locked, in whispers of soft 
 Refusal, and then surrender 
 In the tunnels uptown, 
 The Rat's own dream guns him down 
 The shots echo down them hallways in the night 
 No one watches when the ambulance pulls away 
 Or as the girl shuts out the bedroom light 
 Outside the street's on fire in a real death waltz 
 Between what's flesh and what's fantasy 
 And the poets down here don't write nothing at all 
 They just stand back and let it all be 
 And in the quick of the night, they reach for their moment 
 And try to make an honest stand 
 But they wind up wounded, not even dead 
 Tonight in Jungleland"
24,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Badlands,"Lights out tonight 
 Trouble in the heartland 
 Got a head-on collision 
 Smashin' in my guts, man 
 I'm caught in a crossfire 
 That I don't understand 
 But there's one thing I know for sure girl 
 I don't give a damn 
 For the same old played out scenes 
 I don't give a damn 
 For just the in-betweens 
 Honey, I want the heart, I want the soul 
 I want control right now 
 You better listen to me, baby 
 Talk about a dream 
 Try to make it real 
 You wake up in the night 
 With a fear so real 
 You spend your life waiting 
 For a moment that just don't come 
 Well, don't waste your time waiting 
 Badlands, you gotta live it everyday 
 Let the broken hearts stand 
 As the price you've gotta pay 
 Keep pushin' 'til it's understood 
 And these badlands start treating us good 
 Workin' in the fields 
 'Til you get your back burned 
 Workin' 'neath the wheels 
 'Til you get your facts learned 
 Baby, I got my facts 
 Learned real good right now 
 You better get it straight, darling 
 Poor man wanna be rich 
 Rich man wanna be king 
 And a king ain't satisfied 
 'Til he rules everything 
 I wanna go out tonight 
 I wanna find out what I got 
 Well, I believe in the love that you gave me 
 I believe in the faith that could save me 
 I believe in the hope 
 And I pray that some day 
 It may raise me above these 
 Badlands, you gotta live it everyday 
 Let the broken hearts stand 
 As the price you've gotta pay 
 Keep pushin' 'til it's understood 
 And these badlands start treating us good 
 Whoa whoa whoa whoa 
 For the ones who had a notion 
 A notion deep inside 
 That it ain't no sin 
 To be glad you're alive 
 I wanna find one face 
 That ain't looking through me 
 I wanna find one place 
 I wanna spit in the face of these 
 Badlands, you gotta live it everyday 
 Let the broken hearts stand 
 As the price you've gotta pay 
 Keep pushin' 'til it's understood 
 And these badlands start treating us good

25,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Adam Raised A Cain,"In the summer that I was baptized 
 My father held me to his side 
 As they put me to the water 
 He said how on that day I cried 
 We were prisoners of love, a love in chains 
 He was standin' in the door I was standin' in the rain 
 With the same hot blood burning in our veins 
 Adam raised a Cain 
 All of the old faces 
 Ask you why you're back 
 They fit you with position 
 And the keys to your daddy's Cadillac 
 In the darkness of your room 
 Your mother calls you by your true name 
 You remember the faces, the places, the names 
 You know it's never over it's relentless as the rain 
 Adam raised a Cain 
 In the Bible Cain slew Abel 
 And East of Eden he was cast 
 You're born into this life paying 
 For the sins of somebody else's past 
 Daddy worked his whole life for nothing but the pain 
 Now he walks these empty rooms looking for something to blame 
 You inherit the sins, you inherit the flames 
 Adam raised a Cain 
 Lost but not forgotten, from the dark heart of a dream 
 Adam raised a Cain"
26,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Something In The Night,"I'm riding down Kingsley, figuring I'll get a drink 
 Well, I turn the radio up loud so I don't have to think 
 And I take her to the floor looking for a moment when the world seems right 
 And I tear into the guts of something in the night 
 You're born with nothing and better off that way 
 Soon as you've got something they send someone to try and take it away 
 Well, you can ride this road 'til dawn without another human being in sight 
 Well, just kids wasted on something in the night 
 Well, nothing is forgotten or forgiven when it's your last time around 
 And I got stuff running 'round my head that I just can't live down 
 When we found the things we loved, they were crushed and dying in the dirt 
 We tried to pick up the pieces and get away without getting hurt 
 But they caught us at the state line, burned our cars in one last fight 
 And left us running, burned and blind chasing something in the night"
27,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Candy's Room,"In Candy's room 
 There are pictures of her heroes on the wall 
 To get to Candy's room 
 You gotta walk the darkness of Candy's hall 
 Strangers from the city 
 Call my baby's number, and they bring her toys 
 When I come knocking, she smiles pretty 
 She knows I wanna be Candy's boy 
 There's a sadness hidden in that pretty face 
 A sadness all her own from which no man can keep Candy safe 
 We kiss, my heart's rushes through my brain 
 And the blood rushes in my veins 
 The fire rushes towards the sky 
 And I go driving 
 Driving deep into the night 
 I go driving deep into the light 
 In Candy's eyes 
 She says, ""Baby, if you wanna be wild 
 You got a lot to learn 
 Close your eyes, let them melt 
 Let them fire, let them burn 
 'Cause in the darkness 
 There'll be hidden worlds that shine"" 
 When I hold Candy close 
 She makes those hidden worlds mine 
 She has fancy clothes and diamond rings 
 She has men who'll give her anything 
 She wants but they don't see 
 That what she wants is me 
 Oh, and I want her so 
 I'll never let her go, no, no, no 
 She knows that I'd give 
 All that I've got to give 
 All that I want, all I live 
 To make Candy mine

28,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Racing In The Street,"I got a '69 Chevy with a 396 
 Fuelie heads and a Hurst on the floor 
 She's waiting tonight down in the parking lot 
 Outside the 7-Eleven store 
 Me and my partner Sonny built her straight out of scratch 
 And he rides with me from town to town 
 We only run for the money, got no strings attached 
 We shut 'em up and then we shut 'em down 
 Tonight, tonight the strip's just right 
 I wanna blow 'em off in my first heat 
 Summer's here and the time is right 
 For racing in the street 
 We take all the action we can meet 
 And we cover all the northeast states 
 When the strip shuts down, we run 'em in the street 
 From the fire roads to the interstate 
 Now some guys, they just give up living 
 And start dying little by little, piece by piece 
 Some guys come home from work and wash up 
 Then go racing in the street 
 Tonight, tonight the strip's just right 
 I wanna blow 'em all out of their seats 
 We're calling out around the world 
 We're going racing in the street 
 I met her on the strip three years ago 
 In a Camaro with this dude from L.A. 
 I blew that Camaro off my back 
 And drove that little girl away 
 But now there's wrinkles around my baby's eyes 
 And she cries herself to sleep at night 
 And when I come home, the house is dark 
 She sighs, ""Baby, did you make it all right"" 
 She sits on the porch of her daddy's house 
 But all her pretty dreams are torn 
 She stares off alone into the night 
 With the eyes of one who hates for just being born 
 For all the shutdown strangers and hot rod angels 
 Rumbling through this promised land 
 Tonight my baby and me, we're gonna ride to the sea 
 And wash these sins off our hands 
 Tonight, tonight the highway's bright 
 Out of our way, mister, you best keep 
 Cause summer's here and the time is right 
 For racing in the street"
29,Bruce Springsteen,rock,The Promised Land,"On a rattlesnake speedway in the Utah desert 
 I pick up my money and head back into town 
 Driving cross the Waynesboro county line 
 I got the radio on and I'm just killing time 
 Working all day in my daddy's garage 
 Driving all night chasing some mirage 
 Pretty soon little girl I'm gonna take charge 
 The dogs on Main Street howl 'cause they understand 
 If I could take one moment into my hands 
 Mister I ain't a boy no I'm a man 
 And I believe in a promised land 
 I've done my best to live the right way 
 I get up every morning and go to work each day 
 But your eyes go blind and your blood runs cold 
 Sometimes I feel so weak I just wanna' explode 
 Explode and tear this old town apart 
 Take a knife and cut this pain from my heart 
 Find somebody itching for something to start 
 The dogs on Main Street howl 'cause they understand 
 If I could take one moment into my hands 
 Mister I ain't a boy no I'm a man 
 And I believe in a promised land 
 There's a dark cloud rising from the desert floor 
 I packed my bags and I'm heading straight into the storm 
 Gonna be a twister to blow everything down 
 That ain't got the faith to stand its ground 
 Blow away the dreams that's tear you apart 
 Blow away the dreams that's break your heart 
 Blow away the lies that leave you nothing but lost and broken hearted 
 The dogs on Main Street howl 'cause they understand 
 If I could take one moment into my hands 
 Mister I ain't a boy no I'm a man 
 And I believe in a promised land"
30,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Factory,"Early in the morning factory whistle blows, 
 Man rises from bed and puts on his clothes, 
 Man takes his lunch, walks out in the morning light, 
 It's the working, the working, just the working life. 
 Through the mansions of fear, through the mansions of pain, 
 I see my daddy walking through them factory gates in the rain, 
 Factory takes his hearing, factory gives him life, 
 The working, the working, just the working life. 
 End of the day, factory whistle cries, 
 Men walk through these gates with death in their eyes. 
 And you just better believe, boy, 
 Somebody's gonna get hurt tonight, 
 It's the working, the working, just the working life."
31,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Streets Of Fire,"When the night's quiet and you don't care anymore, 
 And your eyes are tired and there's 
 Someone at your door 
 And you realize you wanna let go 
 And the weak lies and the cold walls you embrace 
 Eat at your insides and leave you face to face with 
 Streets of fire 
 Now I'm wandering, a loser down the track 
 I'm lying, but girl I can't go back 
 'Cause in the darkness I hear somebody call my name 
 And when you realize how they tricked you this time 
 And it's all lies but I'm strung out on the wire 
 In these streets of fire 
 I live now, only with strangers 
 I talk to only strangers 
 I walk with angels that have no place 
 Streets of fire"
32,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Prove It All Night,"I've been working real hard trying to get my hands clean. 
 Tonight we'll drive that dusty road from Monroe to Angeline 
 To buy you a gold ring and a pretty dress of blue. 
 Baby just one kiss will get these things for you, 
 A kiss to seal our fate tonight, 
 A kiss to prove it all night, prove it all night, 
 Girl there's nothing else that we can do. 
 So prove it all night, prove it all night, 
 And girl I'll prove it all night for you. 
 Everybody's got a hunger, a hunger they can't resist. 
 There's so much that you want, you deserve much more than this. 
 But if dreams came true, oh wouldn't that be nice, 
 But this ain't no dream we're livin' all through tonight, 
 Ah girl you want it, you take it, you pay the price 
 To prove it all night, prove it all night, 
 Prove it all night baby and call the bluff. 
 Prove it all night, prove it all night, 
 And girl I'll prove it all night for your love. 
 Baby tie your hair back in a long white bow. 
 Meet me in the fields behind the dynamo. 
 You hear their voices tellin' you not to go. 
 They made their choices and they'll never know 
 What it means to steal, to cheat, to lie. What it's like to live and die... 
 To prove it all night, prove it all night, 
 Baby there's nothin' else that we can do. 
 So prove it all night, prove it all night, 
 Girl I'll prove it all night for you. 
 I'll prove it all night, I'll prove it all night. 
 I'll prove it all night, I'll prove it all night."
33,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Darkness On The Edge Of Town,"They're still racing out at the Trestles 
 But that blood it never burned in her veins 
 Now I hear she's got a house up in Fairview 
 And a style she's trying to maintain 
 Well if she wants to see me 
 You can tell her that I'm easily found 
 Tell her there's a spot out 'neath Abram's Bridge 
 And tell her there's a darkness on the edge of town 
 There's a darkness on the edge of town 
 Well, everybody's got a secret, Sonny 
 Something that they just can't face 
 Some folks spend their whole lives trying to keep it 
 They carry it with them every step that they take 
 Till some day, they just cut it loose 
 Cut it loose or let it drag 'em down 
 Where no one asks any questions 
 Or looks too long in your face 
 In the darkness on the edge of town 
 In the darkness on the edge of town 
 Some folks are born into a good life 
 And other folks get it anyway anyhow 
 I lost my money and I lost my wife 
 Them things don't seem to matter much to me now 
 Tonight I'll be on that hill 'cause I can't stop 
 I'll be on that hill with everything I got 
 With lives on the line where dreams are found and lost 
 I'll be there on time and I'll pay the cost 
 For wanting things that can only be found 
 In the darkness on the edge of town 
 In the darkness on the edge of town"
34,Bruce Springsteen,rock,The Ties That Bind,"You been hurt and you're all cried out, you say 
 You walk down the street pushin' people out of your way 
 You packed your bags and all alone you wanna ride 
 You don't want nothin', don't need no one by your side 
 You're walkin' tough baby, but you're walkin' blind 
 To the ties that bind 
 The ties that bind 
 Now you can't break the ties that bind 
 Cheap romance, it's all just, just a crutch 
 You don't want nothin' that anybody can touch 
 You're so afraid of being somebody's fool 
 Not walkin' tough baby, not walkin' cool 
 You walk cool, but darlin', can you walk the line? 
 And face the ties that bind 
 The ties that bind 
 Now you can't break the ties that bind 
 Oh, I'd rather feel the hurt inside, yes I would darlin' 
 Than know, than know the emptiness your heart must hide 
 Yes I would darlin', yes I would darlin' 
 Yes I would baby 
 You sit and wonder just who's gonna stop the rain 
 Who'll ease the sadness, who's gonna quiet the pain? 
 It's a long dark highway and a thin white line 
 Connecting baby, your heart to mine 
 We're runnin' now but darlin' we will stand in time 
 To face the ties that bind 
 The ties that bind 
 Now you can't break the ties that bind 
 You can't forsake the ties that bind"
35,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Sherry Darling,"Your Mamma's yappin' in the back seat 
 Tell her to push over and move them big feet 
 Every Monday morning I gotta drive her down to the unemployment agency 
 Well this morning I ain't fighting, tell her I give up 
 Tell her she wins if she'll just shut up 
 But it's the last time that she's gonna be ridin' with me 
 You can tell her there's a hot sun beatin' on the black top 
 She keeps talkin', she'll be walkin' that last block 
 She can take a subway back to the ghetto tonight 
 Well, I got some beer and the highway's free 
 And I got you, and baby you've got me 
 Hey, hey, hey what you say, Sherry darlin'? 
 Now there's girls meltin' on the beach 
 And they're so fine but so far out of reach 
 'Cause I'm stuck in traffic down here on 53rd street 
 Now Sherry, my love for you is real 
 But I didn't count on this package deal 
 And baby, this car just ain't big enough for her and me 
 So you can tell her there's a hot sun beatin' on the black top 
 She keeps talkin', she'll be walkin' that last block 
 She can take a subway back to the ghetto tonight 
 Well, I got some beer and the highway's free 
 And I got you, and baby you've got me 
 Hey, hey, hey what you say, Sherry darlin'? 
 Well let there be sunlight, let there be rain 
 Let the brokenhearted love again 
 Sherry we can run with our arms open before the tide 
 To all the girls down at Sacred Heart 
 And all you operators back in the park 
 Say hey, hey, hey what you say, Sherry darlin'? 
 Hey, hey, hey, what you say, Sherry darlin'?"
36,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Jackson Cage,"Driving home, she grabs something to eat 
 Turns a corner and drives down her street 
 Into a row of houses she just melts away 
 Like the scenery in another man's play 
 Into a house where the blinds are closed 
 To keep from seeing things she don't wanna know 
 She pulls the blinds and looks out on the street 
 The cool of the night takes the edge off the heat 
 In the Jackson Cage 
 Down in the Jackson Cage 
 You can try with all your might 
 But you're reminded every night 
 That you been judged and handed life 
 Down in Jackson Cage 
 Every day ends in wasted motion 
 Just crossed swords on the killing floor 
 To settle back is to settle without knowing 
 The hard edge that you're settling for 
 Because there's always just one more day 
 And it's always gonna be that way 
 Little girl you've been down here so long 
 I can tell by the way that you move you belong to 
 The Jackson Cage 
 Down in Jackson Cage 
 And it don't matter just what you say 
 Are you tough enough to play the game they play? 
 Or will you just do your time and fade away? 
 Down into the Jackson Cage 
 Baby there's nights when I dream of a better world 
 But I wake up so downhearted, girl 
 I see you feeling so tired and confused 
 I wonder what it's worth to me or you 
 Just waiting to see some sun 
 Never knowing if that day will ever come 
 Left alone standing out on the street 
 Till you become the hand that turns the key down in 
 Jackson Cage 
 Down in Jackson Cage 
 Well darling, can you understand? 
 The way that they will turn a man 
 Into a stranger to waste away 
 Down in the Jackson Cage"
37,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Two Hearts,"I went out walking the other day 
 Seen a little girl crying along the way 
 She'd been hurt so bad said she'd never love again 
 Someday your crying, girl, will end 
 And you'll find once again 
 Two hearts are better than one 
 Two hearts, girl, get the job done 
 Two hearts are better than one 
 Once I spent my time playing tough guy scenes 
 But I was living in a world of childish dreams 
 Someday these childish dreams must end 
 To become a man and grow up to dream again 
 I believe in the end 
 Two hearts are better than one 
 Two hearts, girl, get the job done 
 Two hearts are better than one 
 Sometimes it might seem like it was planned 
 For you to roam empty hearted through this land 
 Though the world turns you hard and cold 
 There's one thing, mister, that I know 
 That's if you think your heart is stone 
 And that you're rough enough to whip this world alone 
 Alone, buddy, there ain't no peace of mind 
 That's why I'll keep searching 'til I find 
 My special one 
 Two hearts are better than one 
 Two hearts, girl, get the job done 
 Two hearts are better than one 
 I believe 
 Two hearts are better than one 
 Two hearts, girl, get the job done 
 Two hearts are better than one"
38,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Independence Day,"Well Papa, go to bed now, it's getting late 
 Nothing we can say is gonna change anything now 
 I'll be leaving in the morning from St. Mary's Gate 
 We wouldn't change this thing even if we could somehow 
 'Cause the darkness of this house has got the best of us 
 There's a darkness in this town that's got us too 
 But they can't touch me now and you can't touch me now 
 They ain't gonna do to me what I watched them do to you 
 So say goodbye, it's Independence Day 
 It's Independence Day all down the line 
 Just say goodbye, it's Independence Day 
 It's Independence Day this time 
 Now, I don't know what it always was with us 
 We chose the words and yeah, we drew the lines 
 There was just no way this house could hold the two of us 
 I guess that we were just too much of the same kind 
 Well say goodbye, it's Independence Day 
 It's Independence Day, all boys must run away 
 So say goodbye, it's Independence Day 
 All men must make their way, come Independence Day 
 Now the rooms are all empty down at Frankie's joint 
 And the highway, she's deserted clear down to Breaker's Point 
 There's a lot of people leaving town now, leaving their friends, their homes 
 At night they walk that dark and dusty highway all alone 
 Well Papa, go to bed now, it's getting late 
 Nothing we can say can change anything now 
 Because there's just different people coming down here now and they see things in different ways 
 And soon everything we've known will just be swept away 
 So say goodbye, it's Independence Day 
 Papa, now I know the things you wanted that you could not say 
 But won't you just say goodbye, it's Independence Day 
 I swear I never meant to take those things away"
39,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Hungry Heart,"Yeah! 
 Come on! 
 Got a wife and kids in Baltimore, Jack 
 I went out for a ride and I never went back 
 Like a river that don't know where it's flowing 
 I took a wrong turn and I just kept going 
 Everybody's got a hungry heart 
 Everybody's got a hungry heart 
 Lay down your money and you play your part 
 Everybody's got a hungry heart 
 I met her in a Kingstown bar 
 We fell in love, I knew it had to end 
 We took what we had and we ripped it apart 
 Now here I am down in Kingstown again 
 Everybody's got a hungry heart 
 Everybody's got a hungry heart 
 Lay down your money and you play your part 
 Everybody's got a hungry heart 
 Everybody needs a place to rest 
 Everybody wants to have a home 
 Don't make no difference what nobody says 
 Ain't nobody like to be alone, well 
 Everybody's got a hungry heart 
 Everybody's got a hungry heart 
 Lay down your money and you play your part 
 Everybody's got a hungry heart 
 (Everybody's got a hungry heart) Oh yeah 
 (Everybody's got a hungry heart) They got a hungry heart 
 (Lay down your money and you play your part) Oh yeah 
 (Everybody's got a hungry heart) Hungry heart, yeah"
40,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Out In The Street,"Put on your best dress, baby 
 And darlin', fix your hair up right 
 'Cause there's a party, honey 
 Way down beneath the neon lights 
 All day you've been working that hard line 
 Now tonight, you're gonna have a good time 
 I work five days a week, girl 
 Loading crates down on the dock 
 I take my hard earned money 
 And meet my girl down on the block 
 And Monday, when the foreman calls time 
 I've already got Friday on my mind 
 When that whistle blows 
 Girl, I'm down the street 
 I'm home, I'm out of my work clothes 
 When I'm out in the street 
 I walk the way I wanna walk 
 When I'm out in the street 
 I talk the way I wanna talk 
 When I'm out in the street 
 When I'm out in the street 
 When I'm out in the street, girl 
 Well, I never feel alone 
 When I'm out in the street, girl 
 In the crowd, I feel at home 
 The black and whites, they cruise by 
 And they watch us from the corner of their eye 
 But there ain't no doubt, girl, down here 
 We ain't gonna take what they're handing out 
 When I'm out in the street 
 I walk the way I wanna walk 
 When I'm out in the street 
 I talk the way I wanna talk 
 Baby, out in the street, I don't feel sad or blue 
 Baby, out in the street, I'll be waiting for you 
 When the whistle blows 
 Girl, I'm down the street 
 I'm home, I'm out of my work clothes 
 When I'm out in the street 
 I walk the way I wanna walk 
 When I'm out in the street 
 I talk the way I wanna talk 
 When I'm out in the street 
 Pretty girls, they're all passing by 
 When I'm out in the street 
 From the corner, we give them the eye 
 Baby, out in the street, I just feel all right 
 Meet me out in the street, little girl, tonight 
 Meet me out in the street 
 Meet me out in the street"
41,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Crush On You,"My feets were flyin' down the street just the other night 
 When a Hong Kong special pulled up at the light 
 What was inside, man, was just c'est magnifique 
 I wanted to hold the bumper and let her drag me down the street 
 Ooh, ooh, I gotta crush on you 
 Ooh, ooh, I gotta crush on you 
 Ooh, ooh, I gotta crush on you tonight 
 Sometimes I spot a little stranger standing 'cross the room 
 My brain takes a vacation just to give my heart more room 
 For one kiss, darling I swear everything I would give 
 'Cause you're a walking, talking reason to live 
 Ooh, ooh, I gotta crush on you 
 Ooh, ooh, I gotta crush on you 
 Ooh, ooh, I gotta crush on you tonight 
 Well now she might be the talk of high society 
 She's probably got a lousy personality 
 She might be a heiress to Rockefeller 
 She might be a waitress or a bank teller 
 She makes the Venus de Milo look like she's got no style 
 She make Sheena of the Jungle look meek and mild 
 I need a quick shot, Doc, knock me off my feet 
 'Cause I'll be minding my own business walking down the street... watchout! 
 Ooh, ooh, I gotta crush on you 
 Ooh, ooh, I gotta crush on you 
 Ooh, ooh, I gotta crush on you tonight"
42,Bruce Springsteen,rock,You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch),"Yesterday I went shopping buddy down to the mall 
 Looking for something pretty I could hang on my wall 
 I knocked over a lamp before it hit the floor I caught it 
 A salesman turned around said, ""boy, you break that thing you bought it"" 
 You can look but you better not touch boy 
 You can look but you better not touch boy 
 Mess around and you'll end up in dutch boy 
 You can look but you better not, no you better not, no you better not touch 
 Well I came home from work and I switched on Channel 5 
 There was a pretty little girly lookin' straight into my eyes 
 Well I watched as she wiggled back and forth across the screen 
 She didn't get me excited she just made me feel mean 
 You can look but you better not touch boy 
 You can look but you better not touch boy 
 Mess around and you'll end up in dutch boy 
 You can look but you better not, no you better not, no you better not touch 
 Well I called up Dirty Annie on the telephone 
 I took her out to the drive-in just to get her alone 
 I found a lover's rendezvous, the music low, set to park 
 I heard a tappin' on the window and a voice in the dark 
 You can look but you better not touch boy 
 You can look but you better not touch boy 
 Mess around and you'll end up in dutch boy 
 You can look but you better not, no you better not, no you better not touch"
43,Bruce Springsteen,rock,I Wanna Marry You,"I see you walking, baby, down the street 
 Pushing that baby carriage at your feet 
 I see the lonely ribbon in your hair 
 Tell me I am the man for whom you put it there 
 You never smile girl, you never speak 
 You just walk on by, darlin' week after week 
 Raising two kids alone in this mixed up world 
 Must be a lonely life for a working girl 
 Little girl, I wanna marry you 
 Oh yeah, little girl, I wanna marry you 
 Yes I do 
 Little girl, I wanna marry you 
 Now honey, I don't wanna clip your wings 
 But a time comes when two people should think of these things 
 Having a home and a family 
 Facing up to their responsibilities 
 They say in the end true love prevails 
 But in the end true love can't be no fairytale 
 To say I'll make your dreams come true would be wrong 
 But maybe, darlin', I could help them along 
 Little girl, I wanna marry you 
 Oh yeah, little girl, I wanna marry you 
 Yes I do 
 Little girl, I wanna marry you 
 My daddy said right before he died 
 That true, true love was just a lie 
 He went to his grave a broken heart 
 An unfulfilled life, makes a man hard 
 Oh, darlin' 
 There's something happy and there's something sad 
 'Bout wanting somebody, oh so bad, 
 I wear my love darlin', without shame 
 I'd be proud if you would wear my name"
44,Bruce Springsteen,rock,The River,"I come from down in the valley 
 Where, mister, when you're young 
 They bring you up to do like your daddy done 
 Me and Mary we met in high school 
 When she was just seventeen 
 We'd drive out of this valley down to where the fields were green 
 We'd go down to the river 
 And into the river we'd dive 
 Oh, down to the river we'd ride 
 Then I got Mary pregnant 
 And, man, that was all she wrote 
 And for my 19th birthday I got a union card and a wedding coat 
 We went down to the courthouse 
 And the judge put it all to rest 
 No wedding day smiles, no walk down the aisle 
 No flowers, no wedding dress 
 That night we went down to the river 
 And into the river we'd dive 
 Oh, down to the river we did ride 
 I got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company 
 But lately there ain't been much work on account of the economy 
 Now all them things that seemed so important 
 Well, mister, they vanished right into the air 
 Now I just act like I don't remember 
 Mary acts like she don't care 
 But I remember us riding in my brother's car 
 Her body tanned and wet down at the reservoir 
 At night on them banks I'd lie awake 
 And pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take 
 Now those memories come back to haunt me 
 They haunt me like a curse 
 Is a dream a lie if it don't come true 
 Or is it something worse 
 That sends me down to the river 
 Though I know the river is dry 
 That sends me down to the river tonight 
 Down to the river, my baby and I 
 Oho, down to the river we ride"
45,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Point Blank,"Do you still say your prayers little darling, do you go to bed at night 
 Praying that tomorrow, everything will be all right 
 But tomorrow's fall in number in number one by one 
 You wake up and you're dying you don't even know what from, 
 Well they shot you point blank, you been shot in the back 
 Baby point blank, You been fooled this time, little girl that's a fact 
 Right between the eyes 
 Baby point blank, right between the pretty lies that they tell 
 Little girl you fell 
 You grew up where young girls they grow up fast, 
 You took what you were handed and left behind what was asked 
 But what they asked baby wasn't right, 
 You didn't have to live that live 
 I was gonna be your Romeo you were gonna be my Juliet, 
 These days you don't wait on Romeo's, you wait on that welfare check 
 And on all the pretty little things that you can't ever have and on all the promises, 
 That always end up point blank, shot between the eyes 
 Point blank, like little white lies you tell to ease the pain 
 You're walking in the sights 
 Girl point blank, and it's one false move and baby the lights go out 
 Once I dreamed we were together again, baby you and me 
 Back home in those old clubs the way we used to be 
 We were standing at the bar it was hard to hear, 
 The band was playing loud and you were shouting something in my ear 
 You pulled my jacket off and as the drummer counted four, 
 You grabbed my hand and pulled me out on the floor 
 You just stood there and held me, then you started dancing slow 
 And as I pulled you tighter I swore I'd never let you go 
 Well I saw you last night down on the avenue 
 Your face was in the shadows but I knew that it was you 
 You were standing in the doorway out of the rain 
 You didn't answer when I called out your name 
 You just turned and then you looked away 
 Like just another stranger waiting to get blown away 
 Point blank, right between the eyes 
 Point blank, right between the pretty lies you fell 
 Point blank, you've been shot straight through the heart 
 Point blank, you've been twisted up till you've become just another part of it 
 Point blank, you're walking in the sights 
 Point blank, living one false move, just one false move away 
 Point blank, they caught you in their sights 
 Point blank, did you forget how to love, girl did you forget how to fight 
 Point blank, they must have shot you in the head 
 Cause point blank, bang bang baby you're dead"
46,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Cadillac Ranch,"Well, there she sits buddy justa gleaming in the sun 
 There to greet a working man when his day is done 
 I'm gonna pack my pa and I'm gonna pack my aunt 
 I'm gonna take them down to the Cadillac Ranch 
 Eldorado fins, whitewalls and skirts 
 Rides just like a little bit of heaven here on earth 
 Well buddy when I die throw my body in the back 
 And drive me to the junkyard in my Cadillac 
 Cadillac, Cadillac 
 Long and dark, shiny and black 
 Open up your engines let 'em roar 
 Tearing up the highway like a big old dinosaur 
 James Dean in that Mercury '49 
 Junior Johnson runnin' through the woods of Caroline 
 Even Burt Reynolds in that black Trans-Am 
 All gonna meet down at the Cadillac Ranch 
 Cadillac, Cadillac 
 Long and dark, shiny and black 
 Open up them engines let 'em roar 
 Tearing up the highway like a big old dinosaur 
 Hey, little girlie in the blue jeans so tight 
 Drivin' alone through the Wisconsin night 
 You're my last love baby you're my last chance 
 Don't let 'em take me to the Cadillac Ranch 
 Cadillac, Cadillac 
 Long and dark, shiny and black 
 Pulled up to my house today 
 Came and took my little girl away"
47,Bruce Springsteen,rock,I'm A Rocker,"I got a 007 watch and it's a one and only 
 It's got a I-Spy beeper that tells me when you're lonely 
 I got a Batmobile so I can reach ya' in a fast shake 
 When your world's in crisis of an impendin' heartbreak 
 Now don't you call James Bond or Secret Agent Man 
 'Cause they can't do it, like I can 
 I'm a rocker, baby, I'm a rocker - every day 
 I'm a rocker, baby, I'm a rocker 
 If you're hanging from a cliff or you're tied to the tracks, girl 
 Columbo split and you can't find Kojak 
 True love is broken and your tears are fallin' faster 
 You're sufferin' from a pain in your heart or some other natural disaster 
 Now I don't care what kind of shape you're in 
 If they put up a roadblock, I'll parachute in 
 I'm a rocker, baby, I'm a rocker - I'm in love 
 I'm a rocker, baby, I'm a rocker - every day 
 I'm a rocker, baby, I'm a rocker - with you 
 So you fell for some jerk who was tall, dark and handsome 
 Then he kidnapped your heart and now he's holdin' it for ransom 
 Well, like a mission impossible I'm gonna go and get it back 
 You know I would'a taken better care of it, baby, than that 
 Sometimes I get so hot girl, well, I can't talk 
 But when I'm with you I cool off, and I walk 
 I'm a rocker, baby, I'm a rocker, and I talk 
 I'm a rocker, baby, I'm a rocker, every day 
 I'm a rocker, baby, I'm a rocker, every day"
48,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Fade Away,"Well now you say you've found another man 
 Who does things to you that I can't 
 And that no matter what I do 
 It's all over now between me and you, girl 
 But I can't believe what you say 
 No, I can't believe what you say 
 'Cause baby, I don't wanna fade away 
 Oh, I don't wanna fade away 
 Tell me, what can I do, what can I say? 
 'Cause darlin', I don't wanna fade away 
 Well now you say that you've made up your mind 
 It's been such a long, long time 
 Since it's been good with us 
 And that somewhere back along the line 
 You lost your love and I lost your trust 
 Now rooms that once were so bright 
 Are filled with the coming night 
 Oh, darlin', I don't wanna fade away 
 Now, I don't wanna fade away 
 Tell me, what can I do what can I say? 
 'Cause darlin', I don't wanna fade away 
 You say it's not easy for you 
 And that you've been so lonely 
 While other girls go out 
 Doing what they want to do 
 You say that you miss the nights 
 When we'd go out dancing 
 The days when you and I walked as two 
 Well, girl, I miss them, too 
 Oh, I swear that I do 
 Oh, girl 
 Now, baby, I don't wanna be just another useless memory 
 Holding you tight 
 Or just some other ghost out on the street 
 To whom you stop and politely speak 
 When you pass on by 
 Vanishing into the night 
 Left to vanish into the night 
 No, baby, I don't wanna fade away 
 Oh no, I don't wanna fade away 
 Tell me, what can I do, what can I say? 
 'Cause darlin', I don't wanna fade away 
 No, darlin', I don't wanna fade away 
 No, I don't wanna fade away 
 Tell me, what can I do, what can I say? 
 'Cause darlin', I don't wanna fade away 
 Don't make me, darlin'

 Don't make me, darlin' 
 I don't wanna fade away 
 I don't wanna fade away 
 I don't wanna fade away"
49,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Stolen Car,"I met a little girl and I settled down 
 In a little house out on the edge of town 
 We got married, and swore we'd never part 
 Then, little by little, we drifted from each other's heart 
 At first, I thought it was just restlessness 
 That would fade as time went by and our love grew deep 
 In the end, it was something more, I guess 
 That tore us apart and made us weep 
 I'm driving a stolen car 
 Down on Eldridge Avenue 
 Each night, I wait to get caught 
 But I never do 
 She asked if I remembered the letters I wrote 
 When our love was young and bold 
 She said last night she read those letters 
 And they made her feel one hundred years old 
 I'm driving a stolen car on a pitch black night 
 And I'm telling myself I'm gonna be alright 
 But I ride by night, and I travel in fear 
 That in this darkness, I will disappear"
50,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Ramrod,"Hey, little dolly with the blue jeans on

 Come on and meet me tonight down on Bluebird Street 
 I've been working all week, I'm up to my neck in hock 
 Come Saturday night I let my ramrod rock 
 She's a hot stepping hemi with a four on the floor 
 She's a roadrunner engine in a '32 Ford 
 Late at night when I'm dead on the line 
 I swear I think of your pretty face when I let her unwind 
 Well look over yonder see them city lights 
 Come on little dolly 'n' go ramroddin' tonight 
 Come on, come on, come on little baby 
 Come on, come on let's shake it tonight 
 Come on, come, come on little sugar 
 Dance with your daddy and we'll go ramroddin' tonight 
 Hey, little dolly won't you say you will 
 Meet me tonight up on top of the hill 
 Well just a few miles cross the county line 
 There's a cute little chapel nestled down in the pines 
 Say you'll be mine little girl I'll put my foot to the floor 
 Give me the word now sugar, we'll go ramroddin' forever more"
51,Bruce Springsteen,rock,The Price You Pay,"You make up your mind, you choose the chance you take 
 You ride to where the highway ends and the desert breaks 
 Out on to an open road you ride until the day 
 You learn to sleep at night with the price you pay 
 Now with their hands held high, they reached out for the open skies 
 And in one last breath they built the roads they'd ride to their death 
 Driving on through the night, unable to break away 
 From the restless pull of the price you pay 
 Oh, the price you pay, oh, the price you pay 
 Now you can't walk away from the price you pay 
 Now they'd come so far and they'd waited so long 
 Just to end up caught in a dream where everything goes wrong 
 Where the dark of night holds back the light of day 
 And you've gotta stand and fight for the price you pay 
 Oh, the price you pay, oh, the price you pay 
 Now you can't walk away from the price you pay 
 Little girl down on the strand 
 With that pretty little baby in your hands 
 Do you remember the story of the promised land 
 How he crossed the desert sands 
 And could not enter the chosen land 
 On the banks of the river he stayed 
 To face the price you pay 
 So let the games start, you better run you little wild heart 
 You can run through all the nights and all the days 
 But just across the county line, a stranger passing through put up a sign 
 That counts the men fallen away to the price you pay, 
 And girl before the end of the day, 
 I'm gonna tear it down and throw it away"
52,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Drive All Night,"When I lost you honey sometimes I think I lost my guts too 
 And I wish God would send me a word 
 Send me something I'm afraid to lose 
 Lying in the heat of the night like prisoners all our lives 
 I get shivers down my spine and all I wanna do is hold you tight 
 I swear I'll drive all night just to buy you some shoes 
 And to taste your tender charms 
 And I just wanna sleep tonight again in your arms 
 Tonight there's fallen angels and they're waiting for us down in the street 
 Tonight there's calling strangers, 
 Hear them crying in defeat. 
 Let them go, let them go, let them go, 
 Do their dances of the dead (let'em go right ahead) 
 You just dry your eyes girl, and c'mon c'mon 
 C'mon let's go to bed, baby, baby, baby 
 I swear I'll drive all night just to buy you some shoes 
 And to taste your tender charms 
 And I just wanna sleep tonight again in your arms 
 There's machines and there's fire waiting on the edge of town 
 They're out there for hire but baby they can't hurt us now 
 'Cause you've got, you've got, you've got, 
 You've got my love, you've got my love 
 Through the wind, through the rain, the snow, the wind, the rain 
 You've got, you've got my, my love 
 Heart and soul"
53,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Wreck On The Highway,"Last night I was out driving 
 Coming home at the end of the working day 
 I was riding alone through the drizzling rain 
 On a deserted stretch of a county two-lane 
 When I came upon a wreck on the highway 
 There was blood and glass all over 
 And there was nobody there but me 
 As the rain tumbled down hard and cold 
 I seen a young man lying by the side of the road 
 He cried Mister, won't you help me please 
 An ambulance finally came and took him to Riverside 
 I watched as they drove him away 
 And I thought of a girlfriend or a young wife 
 And a state trooper knocking in the middle of the night 
 To say your baby died in a wreck on the highway 
 Sometimes I sit up in the darkness 
 And I watch my baby as she sleeps 
 Then I climb in bed and I hold her tight 
 I just lay there awake in the middle of the night 
 Thinking 'bout the wreck on the highway"
54,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Nebraska,"I saw her standin' on her front lawn just twirlin' her baton 
 Me and her went for a ride sir and ten innocent people died 
 From the town of Lincoln Nebraska with a sawed off .410 on my lap 
 Through to the badlands of Wyoming I killed everything in my path 
 I can't say that I'm sorry for the things that we done 
 At least for a little while sir me and her we had us some fun 
 The jury brought in a guilty verdict and the judge he sentenced me to death 
 Midnight in a prison storeroom with leather straps across my chest 
 Sheriff when the man pulls that switch sir and snaps my poor head back 
 You make sure my pretty baby is sittin' right there on my lap 
 They declared me unfit to live said into that great void my soul'd be hurled 
 They wanted to know why I did what I did 
 Well sir I guess there's just a meanness in this world"
55,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Atlantic City,"Well, they blew up the Chicken Man in Philly last night 
 Now they blew up his house, too 
 Down on the boardwalk they're getting ready for a fight 
 Gonna see what them racket boys can do 
 Now there's trouble busing in from out of state 
 And the D.A. can't get no relief 
 Gonna be a rumble out on the promenade 
 And the gambling commission's hanging on by the skin of its teeth 
 Well now, everything dies, baby, that's a fact 
 Maybe everything that dies someday comes back 
 Put your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty 
 And meet me tonight in Atlantic City 
 Well, I got a job and tried to put my money away 
 But I got debts that no honest man can pay 
 So I drew what I had from the Central Trust 
 And I bought us two tickets on that Coast City bus 
 Now, baby, everything dies, baby, that's a fact 
 But maybe everything that dies someday comes back 
 Put your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty 
 And meet me tonight in Atlantic City 
 Now our luck may have died and love may be cold 
 But with you forever I'll stay 
 We're going out where the sand's turning to gold 
 So put on your stockings, baby, 'cause the night's getting cold 
 And everything dies, baby, that's a fact 
 But maybe everything that dies someday comes back 
 Now I been looking for a job but it's hard to find 
 Down here, it's just winners and losers and don't get caught on the wrong side of that line 
 Well, I'm tired of coming out on this losing end 
 So, honey, last night I met this guy and I'm gonna do a little favor for him 
 Well, I guess everything dies, baby, that's a fact 
 But maybe everything that dies someday comes back 
 Put your hair up nice, fix yourself up pretty 
 And meet me tonight in Atlantic City 
 Meet me tonight in Atlantic City 
 Meet me tonight in Atlantic City 
 Meet me tonight in Atlantic City"
56,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Mansion On The Hill,"There's a place out on the edge of town, sir 
 Rising above the factories and the fields 
 Now, ever since I was a child I can remember 
 That mansion on the hill 
 In the day, you can see the children playing 
 On the road that leads to those gates of hardened steel 
 Steel gates that completely surround, sir 
 The mansion on the hill 
 At night, my daddy'd take me and we'd ride 
 Through the streets of a town so silent and still 
 Park on a back road along the highway side 
 Look up at that mansion on the hill 
 In the summer, all the lights would shine 
 There'd be music playing, people laughing all the time 
 Me and my sister we'd hide out in the tall corn fields 
 Sit and listen to the mansion on the hill 
 Tonight, down here in Linden town 
 I watch the cars rushing by home from the mill 
 There's a beautiful full moon rising 
 Above the mansion on the hill"
57,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Johnny 99,"Well, they closed down the auto plant in Mahwah late that month 
 Ralph went out lookin' for a job but he couldn't find none 
 He came home too drunk from mixin' Tanqueray and wine 
 He got a gun, shot a night clerk, now they call him Johnny 99 
 Down in the part of town where when you hit a red light you don't stop 
 Johnny's wavin' his gun around and threatenin' to blow his top 
 When an off-duty cop snuck up on him from behind 
 Out in front of the club Tip Top, they slapped the cuffs on Johnny 99 
 Well the city supplied a public defender but the judge was mean John Brown 
 He came into the courtroom and stared poor Johnny down 
 Well the evidence is clear gonna let the sentence, son, fit the crime 
 Prison for 98 and a year and we'll call it even, Johnny 99 
 A fist fight broke out in the courtroom, they had to drag Johnny's girl away 
 His mama stood up and shouted ""Judge, don't take my boy this way"" 
 Well, son, you got any statement you'd like to make 
 Before the bailiff comes and forever take you away 
 Now judge, judge, I got debts no honest man could pay 
 The bank was holdin' my mortgage and takin' my house away 
 Now I ain't sayin' that make me an innocent man 
 But it was more'n all this that put that gun in my hand 
 Well, Your Honor, I do believe I'd be better off dead 
 And if you can take a man's life for the thoughts that's in his head 
 Then won't you sit back in that chair and think it over, judge, one more time 
 And let 'em shave off my hair and put me on that execution line"
58,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Highway Patrolman,"My name is Joe Roberts, I work for the state 
 I'm a sergeant out of Perrineville barracks number 8 
 I always done an honest job as honest as I could 
 I got a brother named Franky and Franky ain't no good 
 Now ever since we was young kids, it's been the same come down 
 I get a call on the short-wave, Franky's in trouble downtown 
 Well, if it was any other man, I'd put him straight away 
 But when it's your brother, sometimes you look the other way 
 Me and Franky laughin' and drinkin', nothin' feels better than blood on blood 
 Takin' turns dancin' with Maria as the band played ""Night of the Johnstown Flood"" 
 I catch him when he's strayin', like any brother would 
 Man turns his back on his family, well, he just ain't no good 
 Well, Franky went in the army back in 1965 
 I got a farm deferment, settled down, took Maria for my wife 
 But them wheat prices kept on droppin' 'til it was like we were gettin' robbed 
 Franky came home in '68, and me, I took this job 
 Yeah, we're laughin' and drinkin', nothin' feels better than blood on blood 
 Takin' turns dancin' with Maria as the band played ""Night of the Johnstown Flood"" 
 I catch him when he's strayin', teach him how to walk that line 
 Man turns his back on his family, he ain't no friend of mine 
 Well, the night was like any other, I got a call 'bout quarter to nine 
 There was trouble in a roadhouse out on the Michigan line 
 There was a kid lyin' on the floor, lookin' bad, bleedin' hard from his head 
 There was a girl cryin' at a table and it was Frank, they said 
 Well, I went out and I jumped in my car and I hit the lights 
 Well, I must've done a hundred and ten through Michigan county that night 
 It was out at the crossroads, down round Willow bank 
 Seen a Buick with Ohio plates, behind the wheel was Frank 
 Well, I chased him through them county roads 'til a sign said Canadian border five miles from here 
 Pulled over the side of the highway and watched his taillights disappear 
 Me and Franky laughin' and drinkin', nothin' feels better than blood on blood 
 Takin' turns dancin' with Maria as the band played ""Night of the Johnstown Flood"" 
 I catch him when he's strayin', like any brother would 
 Man turns his back on his family, he just ain't no good"
59,Bruce Springsteen,rock,State Trooper,"New Jersey Turnpike, ridin' on a wet night 'neath the refinery's glow 
 Out where the great black rivers flow 
 License, registration--I ain't got none 
 But I got a clear conscience 'bout the things that I done 
 Mr. state trooper, please don't stop me 
 Please don't stop me, please don't stop me 
 Maybe you got a kid, maybe you got a pretty wife 
 The only thing that I gots been both'rin' me my whole life 
 Mr. state trooper, please don't stop me 
 Please don't stop me, please don't stop me 
 In the wee, wee hours, your mind gets hazy 
 Radio relay towers gonna lead me to my baby 
 The radio's jammed up with talk-show stations 
 It's just talk, talk, talk, talk till you lose your patience 
 Mr. state trooper, please don't stop me 
 Hey, somebody out there, listen to my last prayer 
 Hi-ho, silver-o, deliver me from nowhere"
60,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Used Cars,"My little sister's in the front seat with an ice cream cone 
 My ma's in the black seat sittin' all alone 
 As my pa steers her slow out of the lot 
 For a test drive down Michigan Avenue 
 Now, my ma, she fingers her wedding band 
 And watches the salesman stare at my old man's hands 
 He's tellin' us all 'bout the break he'd give us if he could, but he just can't 
 Well if I could, I swear I know just what I'd do 
 Now, mister, the day the lottery I win I ain't ever gonna ride in no used car again 
 Now, the neighbors come from near and far 
 As we pull up in our brand new used car 
 I wish he'd just hit the gas and let out a cry 
 Tell 'em all they can kiss our asses goodbye 
 My dad, he sweats the same job from mornin' to morn 
 Me, I walk home on the same dirty streets where I was born 
 Up the block I can hear my little sister in the front seat blowin' that horn 
 The sounds echoin' all down Michigan Avenue 
 Now, mister, the day my number comes in I ain't ever gonna ride in no used car again"
61,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Open All Night,"Well, I had the carburetor, baby, cleaned and checked with her line blown out she's hummin' like a turbojet 
 Propped her up in the backyard on concrete blocks for a new clutch plate and a new set of shocks 
 Took her down to the carwash, check the plugs and points 
 Well, I'm goin' out tonight. I'm gonna rock that joint 
 Early north Jersey industrial skyline I'm a all-set cobra jet creepin' through the nighttime 
 Gotta find a gas station, gotta find a payphone this turnpike sure is spooky at night when you're all alone 
 Gotta hit the gas, baby. I'm running late, this New Jersey in the mornin' like a lunar landscape 
 Now, the boss don't dig me, so he put me on the nightshift 
 It's an all night run to get back to where my baby lives 
 In the wee wee hours your mind gets hazy radio relay towers, won't you lead me to my baby? 
 Underneath the overpass, trooper hits his party light switch 
 Goodnight good luck one two power shift 
 I met Wanda when she was employed behind the counter at route 60 Bob's Big Boy 
 Fried chicken on the front seat, she's sittin' in my lap 
 We're wipin' our fingers on a Texaco roadmap 
 I remember Wanda up on scrap metal hill with them big brown eyes that make your heart stand still 
 Well, at five a.m., oil pressure's sinkin' fast 
 I make a pit stop, wipe the windshield, check the gas 
 Gotta call my baby on the telephone 
 Let her know that her daddy's comin' on home 
 Sit tight, little mama, I'm comin' 'round I got three more hours, but I'm coverin' ground 
 Your eyes get itchy in the wee wee hours sun's just a red ball risin' over them refinery towers 
 Radio's jammed up with gospel stations lost souls callin' long distance salvation 
 Hey, mister deejay, woncha hear my last prayer hey, ho, rock'n'roll, deliver me from nowhere"
62,Bruce Springsteen,rock,My Father's House,"Last night I dreamed that I was a child out where the pines grow wild and tall 
 I was trying to make it home through the forest before the darkness falls 
 I heard the wind rustling through the trees and ghostly voices rose from the fields 
 I ran with my heart pounding down that broken path 
 With the devil snappin' at my heels 
 I broke through the trees, and there in the night 
 My father's house stood shining hard and bright the branches and brambles tore my clothes and scratched my arms 
 But I ran till I fell, shaking in his arms 
 I awoke and I imagined the hard things that pulled us apart 
 Will never again, sir, tear us from each other's hearts 
 I got dressed, and to that house I did ride from out on the road, I could see its windows shining in light 
 I walked up the steps and stood on the porch a woman I didn't recognize came and spoke to me through a chained door 
 I told her my story, and who I'd come for 
 She said ""I'm sorry, son, but no one by that name lives here anymore"" 
 My father's house shines hard and bright it stands like a beacon calling me in the night 
 Calling and calling, so cold and alone 
 Shining 'cross this dark highway where our sins lie unatoned"
63,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Reason To Believe,"Seen a man standin' over a dead dog lyin' by the highway in a ditch 
 He's lookin' down kinda puzzled pokin' that dog with a stick 
 Got his car door flung open he's standin' out on highway 31 
 Like if he stood there long enough that dog'd get up and run 
 Struck me kinda funny seem kinda funny sir to me 
 Still at the end of every hard earned day people find some reason to believe 
 Now Mary Lou loved Johnny with a love mean and true 
 She said ""Baby I'll work for you every day and bring my money home to you"" 
 One day he up and left her and ever since that 
 She waits down at the end of that dirt road for young Johnny to come back 
 Struck me kinda funny seemed kind of funny sir to me 
 How at the end of every hard earned day people find some reason to believe 
 Take a baby to the river Kyle William they called him 
 Wash the baby in the water take away little Kyle's sin 
 In a whitewash shotgun shack an old man passes away take his body to the graveyard and over him they pray Lord won't you tell us 
 Tell us what does it mean 
 Still at the end of every hard earned day people find some reason to believe 
 Congregation gathers down by the riverside 
 Preacher stands with his Bible groom stands waitin' for his bride 
 Congregation gone and the sun sets behind a weepin' willow tree 
 Groom stands alone and watches the river rush on so effortlessly 
 Wonderin' where can his baby be still at the end of every hard earned day people find some reason to believe"
64,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Born In The U.S.A.,"Born down in a dead man's town

 Oh yea 
 Oh no 
 No, no,no 
 I had a brother at Khe Sahn 
 Fighting off the Viet Cong 
 They're still there, he's all gone 
 He had a woman he loved in Saigon 
 I got a picture of him in her arms, now 
 Down in the shadow of the penitentiary 
 Out by the gas fires of the refinery

 Nowhere to run, ain't got nowhere to go

 Talking 'bout the weekend, scrubbing off the dirt 
 Some heading home to their families, some are looking to get hurt 
 Some going down to Stovell wearing trouble on their shirts 
 I work for the county out on 95 
 All day I hold a red flag and watch the traffic pass me by 
 In my head I keep a picture of a pretty little miss 
 Someday mister, I'm gonna lead a better life than this 
 Working on the highway, laying down the blacktop 
 Working on the highway, all day long I don't stop 
 Working on the highway, blasting through the bedrock 
 Working on the highway, working on the highway 
 I met her at a dance down at the union hall 
 She was standing with her brothers, back up against the wall 
 Sometimes we'd go walking down the union tracks 
 One day I looked straight at her and she looked straight back 
 So I'm working on the highway, laying down the blacktop 
 Working on the highway, all day long I don't stop 
 Working on the highway, blasting through the bedrock 
 Working on the highway, working on the highway 
 I saved up my money and I put it all away 
 I went to see her daddy but we didn't have much to say 
 ""Son, can't you see that she's just a little girl? 
 She don't know nothing about this cruel, cruel world"" 
 We lit out down to Florida, we got along alright 
 One day her brothers came and got her and they took me in a black and white 
 The prosecutor kept the promise that he made on that day 
 And the judge got mad and he put me straight away 
 I wake up every morning to the work bell clang 
 Me and the warden go swinging on the Charlotte County road gang 
 I'm working on the highway, laying down the blacktop 
 Working on the highway, all day long I don't stop 
 Working on the highway, blasting through the bedrock 
 Working on the highway, working on the highway

68,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Downbound Train,"I had a job, I had a girl 
 I had something going, mister, in this world 
 I got laid off down at the lumber yard 
 Our love went bad, times got hard 
 Now I work down at the car wash 
 Where all it ever does is rain 
 Don't you feel like you're a rider 
 On a downbound train? 
 She just said, ""Joe, I gotta go 
 We had it once, we ain't got it anymore"" 
 She packed her bags, left me behind 
 She bought a ticket on the Central Line 
 Nights as I sleep, I hear that whistle whining 
 I feel her kiss in the misty rain 
 And I feel like I'm a rider 
 On a downbound train 
 Last night, I heard your voice 
 You were crying, crying, you were so alone 
 You said your love had never died 
 You were waiting for me at home 
 Put on my jacket, I ran through the woods 
 I ran 'til I thought my chest would explode 
 There in the clearing, beyond the highway 
 In the moonlight, our wedding house shone 
 I rushed through the yard, I burst through the front door 
 My head pounding hard, up the stairs I climbed 
 The room was dark, our bed was empty, then I heard that long whistle whine 
 And I dropped to my knees, hung my head and cried 
 Now I swing a sledgehammer on a railroad gang 
 Knocking down them cross ties, working in the rain 
 Now don't it feel like you're a rider 
 On a downbound train?"
69,Bruce Springsteen,rock,I'm On Fire,"Hey, little girl, is your daddy home? 
 Did he go away and leave you all alone, mm-hmm? 
 I got a bad desire 
 Oh-oh-oh, I'm on fire 
 Tell me now, baby, is he good to you? 
 Can he do to you the things that I do, uh-huh? 
 I can take you higher 
 Oh-oh-oh, I'm on fire 
 Sometimes it's like someone took a knife, baby, edgy and dull 
 And cut a six-inch valley through the middle of my skull 
 At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet 
 And a freight train running through the middle of my head 
 Only you can cool my desire 
 Oh-oh-oh, I'm on fire 
 Oh-oh-oh, I'm on fire 
 Oh-oh-oh, I'm on fire"
70,Bruce Springsteen,rock,No Surrender,"Well, we busted out of class 
 Had to get away from those fools 
 We learned more from a three minute record, baby 
 Than we ever learned in school 
 Tonight I hear the neighborhood drummer sound 
 I can feel my heart begin to pound 
 You say you're tired and you just want to close your eyes 
 And follow your dreams down 
 Well, we made a promise we swore we'd always remember 
 No retreat, baby, no surrender 
 Like soldiers in the winter's night with a vow to defend 
 No retreat, baby, no surrender 
 Now young faces grow sad and old 
 And hearts of fire grow cold 
 We swore blood brothers against the wind 
 Now I'm ready to grow young again 
 And hear your sister's voice calling us home 
 Across the open yards 
 Well, maybe we could cut some place of our own 
 With these drums and these guitars 
 'Cause we made a promise we swore we'd always remember 
 No retreat, baby, no surrender 
 Blood brothers in the stormy night with a vow to defend 
 No retreat, baby, no surrender 
 Now on the street tonight the lights grow dim 
 The walls of my room are closing in 
 There's a war outside still raging 
 You say it ain't ours anymore to win 
 I want to sleep beneath peaceful skies 
 In my lover's bed 
 With a wide open country in my eyes 
 And these romantic dreams in my head 
 'Cause once we made a promise we swore we'd always remember 
 No retreat, baby, no surrender 
 Blood brothers in the stormy night with a vow to defend 
 No retreat, baby, no surrender 
 No retreat, baby, no surrender"
71,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Bobby Jean,"Well, I came by your house the other day 
 Your mother said you went away 
 She said there was nothing that I could've done 
 There was nothing nobody could say 
 Now, me and you, we've known each other 
 Ever since we were sixteen 
 I wished I would have known, I wished I could have called you 
 Just to say goodbye, Bobby Jean 
 Now, you hung with me when all the others 
 Turned away, turned up their nose 
 We liked the same music, we liked the same bands 
 We liked the same clothes 
 Yeah, we told each other that we were the wildest 
 The wildest things we'd ever seen 
 And I wished you would have told me, I wished I could have talked to you 
 Just to say goodbye, Bobby Jean 
 Now, we went walking in the rain 
 Talking about the pain that from the world we hid 
 Now, there ain't nobody, nowhere, nohow 
 Gonna ever understand me the way you did 
 Well, maybe you'll be out there on that road somewhere 
 In some bus or train, traveling alone 
 In some motel room there'll be a radio playing 
 And you'll hear me sing this song 
 Well, if you do, you'll know I'm thinking of you 
 And all the miles in between 
 And I'm just calling one last time not to change your mind 
 But just to say I miss you, baby, good luck, goodbye, Bobby Jean"
72,Bruce Springsteen,rock,I'm Goin' Down,"We sit in the car outside your house, you're quiet 
 I can feel the heat coming around 
 I go to put my arm around you and you 
 Give me a look like I'm way out of bounds 
 Well, you let out one of your bored sighs 
 And lately when I look into your eyes 
 I'm goin' down, down, down, down 
 I'm goin' down, down, down, down 
 I'm goin' down, down, down, down 
 I'm goin' down, down, down, down 
 We get dressed up and we go 
 Out, baby, for the night 
 We come home early, burning, burning 
 Burning in some firefight 
 I'm sick and tired of you setting me up, yeah 
 Set me up just to knock-a-knock-a-knock-a me 
 Down, down, down, down 
 I'm goin' down, down, down, down 
 I'm goin' down, down, down, down 
 I'm goin' down, down, down, down 
 I pull you close now, baby 
 But when we kiss I can feel a doubt 
 I remember back when we started 
 My kisses used to turn you inside out 
 I used to drive you to work in the morning 
 Friday night I'd drive you all around 
 You used to love to drive me wild 
 But lately girl, you get your kicks from just driving me down 
 Down, down, down 
 I'm goin' down, down, down, down 
 I'm goin' down, down, down, down 
 I'm goin' down, down, down, down 
 I'm goin' down, down, down, down 
 I'm goin' down, down, down, down 
 I'm goin' down, down, down, down 
 I'm goin' down, down, down, down"
73,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Glory Days,"Yeah 
 Come on 
 I had a friend was a big baseball player 
 Back in high school 
 He could throw that speedball by ya 
 Make you look like a fool, boy 
 Saw him the other night at this roadside bar 
 I was walking in; he was walking out 
 We went back inside, sat down, had a few drinks 
 But all he kept talking about was 
 Glory days, yeah, they'll pass you by 
 Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye 
 Glory days, glory days 
 Alright! 
 Well there's a girl that lives up the block 
 Back at school she could turn all the boys' heads 
 Sometimes on a Friday I'll stop by and have a few drinks 
 After she put her kids to bed 
 Her and her husband Bobby, well, they split up 
 I guess it's two years gone by now 
 We just sit around talking about the old times 
 She says when she feels like crying she starts laughing thinking about 
 Glory days, yeah, they'll pass you by 
 Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye 
 Glory days, glory days 
 Oooh! 
 I think I'm going down to the well tonight 
 And I'm gonna drink 'til I get my fill 
 And I hope when I get old I don't sit around thinking about it 
 But I probably will 
 Yeah, just sittin' back trying to recapture 
 A little of the glory, yeah 
 Well, the time slips away and leaves you with nothing, mister 
 But boring stories of 
 Glory days, yeah, they'll pass you by 
 Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye 
 Glory days, glory days 
 Yeah, they'll pass you by 
 Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye 
 Glory days, glory days 
 Well alright, ooh, yeah 
 Well alright (Alright), come on now 
 Well alright (Alright), ooh, yeah 
 Well alright (Alright), come on now 
 Oooh 
 Ooohooo 
 Ooohooo 
 Ooohooo 
 Alright, boys, keep it rocking now!

 We gonna go home now 
 We're goin' home 
 Alright 
 Well alright 
 Well alright 
 Well alright 
 Well alright 
 Well alright 
 Well alright 
 Well alright 
 Let's go!"
74,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Dancing In The Dark,"I get up in the evening 
 And I ain't got nothing to say 
 I come home in the morning 
 I go to bed feeling the same way 
 I ain't nothing but tired 
 Man, I'm just tired and bored with myself 
 Hey there, baby 
 I could use just a little help 
 You can't start a fire 
 You can't start a fire without a spark 
 This gun's for hire 
 Even if we're just dancing in the dark 
 Messages keep getting clearer 
 Radio's on and I'm moving 'round the place 
 I check my look in the mirror 
 Wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face 
 Man, I ain't getting nowhere 
 I'm just livin' in a dump like this 
 There's something happening somewhere 
 Baby, I just know that there is 
 You can't start a fire 
 You can't start a fire without a spark 
 This gun's for hire 
 Even if we're just dancing in the dark 
 You sit around getting older 
 There's a joke here somewhere and it's on me 
 I'll shake this world off my shoulders 
 Come on, baby, the laugh's on me 
 Stay on the streets of this town 
 And they'll be carving you up alright 
 They say you gotta stay hungry 
 Hey baby, I'm just about starving tonight 
 I'm dying for some action 
 I'm sick of sittin' 'round here trying to write this book 
 I need a love reaction 
 Come on, baby, gimme just one look 
 You can't start a fire 
 Sittin' 'round crying over a broken heart 
 This gun's for hire 
 Even if we're just dancing in the dark 
 You can't start a fire 
 Worrying about your little world falling apart 
 This gun's for hire 
 Even if we're just dancing in the dark 
 Even if we're just dancing in the dark 
 Even if we're just dancing in the dark 
 Even if we're just dancing in the dark 
 Hey, baby!"
75,Bruce Springsteen,rock,My Hometown,"I was eight years old and running with a dime in my hand 
 To the bus stop to pick up a paper for my old man 
 I'd sit on his lap in that big old Buick and steer as we drove through town 
 He'd tousle my hair and say, ""Son, take a good look around 
 This is your hometown 
 This is your hometown 
 This is your hometown 
 This is your hometown"" 
 In '65, tension was running high at my high school 
 There was a lot of fights between the black and white, there was nothing you could do 
 Two cars at a light on a Saturday night, in the backseat there was a gun 
 Words were passed, in a shotgun blast troubled times had come 
 In my hometown 
 My hometown 
 My hometown 
 To my hometown 
 Now Main Street's whitewashed windows and vacant stores 
 Seems like there ain't nobody wants to come down here no more 
 They're closing down the textile mill across the railroad tracks 
 Foreman says, these jobs are going, boys, and they ain't coming back 
 To your hometown 
 Your hometown 
 Your hometown 
 Your hometown 
 Last night me and Kate, we laid in bed, talking about getting out 
 Packing up our bags, maybe heading south 
 I'm thirty-five, we got a boy of our own now 
 Last night, I sat him up behind the wheel and said, ""Son, take a good look around 
 This is your hometown"""
76,Bruce Springsteen,rock,"Paradise By The ""C""","Where the river runs to black 
 I take the schoolbooks from your pack 
 Plastics, wire and your kiss 
 The breath of eternity on your lips 
 In the crowded marketplace 
 I drift from face to face 
 I hold my breath and close my eyes 
 I hold my breath and close my eyes 
 And I wait for paradise 
 And I wait for paradise 
 The Virginia hills have gone to brown 
 Another day, another sun goin' down 
 I visit you in another dream 
 I visit you in another dream 
 I reach and feel your hair 
 Your smell lingers in the air 
 I brush your cheek with my fingertips 
 I taste the void upon your lips 
 And I wait for paradise 
 And I wait for paradise 
 I search for you on the other side 
 Where the river runs clean and wide 
 Up to my heart the water rise 
 Up to my heart the water rise 
 I sink 'neath the water cool and clear 
 Drifting down, I disappear 
 I see you on the other side 
 I search for the peace in your eyes 
 But they're as empty as paradise 
 They're as empty as paradise 
 I break above the waves 
 I feel the sun upon my face"
77,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Fire,"I'm driving in my car, I turn on the radio 
 I'm pulling you close, you just say no 
 You say you don't like it but, girl, I know you're a liar 
 'Cause when we kiss, mmm, fire. 
 Late at night, I'm takin' you home 
 I whisper stay, you say you wanna be alone 
 You say you don't need me but, baby, I know you're a liar 
 'Cause when we kiss, mmm, fire, fire. 
 You had a hold on me right from the start 
 In a grip so tight I can't tear it apart 
 My nerves all jumpin' actin' like a fool 
 Your kisses they burn but your heart stays cool. 
 Romeo and Juliet, Samson and Delilah 
 You can bet their love, they didn't deny 
 Your words say split but your words they lie 
 When we kiss, oh, fire, fire. 
 You had a hold on me right from the start 
 In a grip so tight I can't tear it apart 
 My nerves all jumpin' actin' like a fool

 Romeo and Juliet, Samson and Delilah 
 You can bet their love, they didn't deny 
 Your words say split but your words they lie 
 When we kiss, oh, fire, fire, fire, fire ..."
78,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Raise Your Hand,"If there's something you need 
 That you just don't have 
 Well just don't sit there 
 Feeling bad 
 Come on now get up 
 Try and understand 
 Just raise your hand 
 Baby here I am 
 You know I'm standing in line 
 I wanna give you my love 
 Please let me try 
 Come on now get up 
 Try and understand"
79,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Because The Night,"Take me now baby here as I am 
 Pull me close try and understand 
 Desire is hunger, is the fire I breathe 
 Love is the banquet on which we feed 
 Come on now try and understand 
 The way I feel when I'm in your hands 
 Take my hand, come under cover 
 They can't hurt you now 
 They can't hurt you now 
 They can't hurt you now 
 Because the night belongs to lovers 
 Because the night belongs to lust 
 Because the night belongs to lovers 
 Because the night belongs to us 
 I hear my doubt when I'm alone 
 Love is a ring, the telephone 
 Love is an angel disguised as lust 
 Here in our bed 'til the morning comes 
 Come on now try and understand 
 The way I feel under your command 
 Take my hand as the sun descends 
 They can't touch you now 
 They can't touch you now 
 They can't touch you now 
 Because the night belongs to lovers 
 Because the night belongs to lust 
 Because the night belongs to lovers 
 Because the night belongs to us 
 With love we sleep 
 With doubt the vicious circle 
 Turns and burns 
 Without you I cannot live 
 Forgive, me now 
 The time has come to take the moment and 
 They can't hurt us now 
 They can't hurt us now 
 Because the night belongs to lovers 
 Because the night belongs to lust 
 Because the night belongs to lovers 
 Because the night belongs to us"
80,Bruce Springsteen,rock,This Land Is Your Land,"Well I rode that ribbon highway 
 I saw above me the endless sky 
 I saw below me the golden valley 
 This land was made for you and me 
 I've roamed and rambled and followed my footsteps 
 Through the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts 
 And all around me a voice was calling 
 This land was made for you and me 
 This land is your land 
 This land is my land 
 From California 
 To the New York island 
 From the Redwood Forest 
 To the Gulf Stream waters 
 This land was made for you and me 
 Well the sun came shining and I was strolling 
 Through wheat fields waving and dust clouds rolling 
 And a voice was sounding 
 As the fog was lifting 
 Saying this land was made for you and me 
 This land is your land 
 This land is my land 
 From California 
 To the New York island 
 From the Redwood Forest 
 To the Gulf Stream waters 
 This land was made for you and me"
81,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Seeds,"Well a great black river a man had found 
 So he put all his money in a hole in the ground 
 And sent a big steel arm drivin' down down down 
 Man now I live on the streets of Houston town 
 Packed up my wife and kids when winter came along 
 And we headed down south with just spit and a song 
 But they said ""Sorry son it's gone gone gone"" 
 Well there's men hunkered down by the railroad tracks 
 The Elkhorn Special blowin' my hair back 
 Tents pitched on the highway in the dirty moonlight 
 And I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight 
 Parked in the lumberyard freezin' our asses off 
 My kids in the back seat got a graveyard cough 
 Well I'm sleepin' up in front with my wife 
 Billy club tappin' on the windshield in the middle of the night 
 Says ""Move along man move along"" 
 Well big limousine long shiny and black 
 You don't look ahead you don't look back 
 How many times can you get up after you've been hit? 
 Well I swear if I could spare the spit 
 I'd lay one on your shiny chrome 
 And send you on your way back home 
 So if you're gonna leave your town where the north wind blow 
 To go on down where that sweet soda river flow 
 Well you better think twice on it Jack 
 You're better off buyin' a shotgun dead off the rack 
 You ain't gonna find nothin' down here friend 
 Except seeds blowin' up the highway in the south wind"
82,Bruce Springsteen,rock,War,"If you grew up in the 60's 
 You grew up with war on TV every night 
 A war that your friends were involved in 
 And I want to do this song tonight for all the young people out there 
 If you're in your teens 
 Because I remember a lot of my friends when they we were 17 or 18 
 We didn't have much of a chance to think about how we felt about a lot of things 
 And the next time they're gonna be looking at you 
 And you're gonna need a lot of information to know what you're gonna wanna do 
 Because in 1985, blind faith in your leaders, or in anything, will get you killed 
 'Cause what I'm talking about here is 
 War (Ooh!), ooh, yeaheaheaheah 
 What is it good for? 
 Absolutely nothing! 
 Say it again 
 War (Ooh!), ooh, yeaheaheaheah 
 What is it good for? 
 Absolutely nothing! 
 Come on! 
 War is something that I despise 
 For it means destruction of innocent lives 
 And thousands of mothers and their mothers cry 
 When their sons go out to fight to give their lives 
 War (Ooh!), ohoho, yeah 
 What is it good for? 
 Absolutely nothing! 
 Say it again 
 War (Ooh!), ohoho, yeah 
 What is it good for? 
 Absolutely nothing! 
 Hey! 
 War (Ooh!), it's nothing but a heartbreaker 
 War (Ooh!), friend only to the undertaker 
 Yeah, the war is the enemy of all mankind 
 The thought of War (Ooh!), it blows my mind 
 Handed down from generation to generation 
 Induction, destruction, who wants to die? 
 War (Ooh!), ohoho now 
 What is it good for? 
 Absolutely nothing! 
 Say it again 
 War (Ooh!), yeaheaheaheah 
 What is it good for? 
 Absolutely nothing! 
 Come on, man 
 War (Ooh!), it ain't nothing but a heartbreaker 
 War (Ooh!), friend only to the undertaker 
 War has shattered many young men's dreams 
 Made them disabled, bitter and mean 
 Life is too precious to be fighting wars each day 
 War can't give life, it can only take it away 
 War (Ooh!), ohoho, yeah 
 What is it good for? 
 Absolutely nothing! 
 Say it again 
 War (Ooh!), good god 
 What is it good for? 
 Absolutely nothing! 
 Peace love and understanding, god 
 There must be some place for these things today 
 They say we must fight to keep our freedom 
 But, Lord, there's gotta be another way that's better than 
 War (Ooh!), yeaheaheaheah 
 What is it good for? 
 Absolutely nothing! 
 Say it again! 
 War (Ooh!), good god 
 What is it good for? 
 Absolutely nothing! 
 Come on now! 
 War (Ooh!), yeaheaheaheah 
 What is it good for? 
 Absolutely nothing! 
 Say it again! 
 War (Ooh!), oh yeah 
 What is it good for? 
 Nothing! 
 I'm talking 'bout war!"
83,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Jersey Girl,"I got no time for the corner boys 
 Down in the street making all that noise 
 Or the girls down on the avenue 
 'Cause tonight I wanna be with you 
 Tonight I'm gonna take that ride 
 Across the river to the Jersey side 
 Take my baby to the carnival 
 And I'll take her on all the rides 
 'Cause down the shore everything's all right 
 You and your baby on a Saturday night

 We're gonna take that little girl of yours 
 And drop her off at your mom's

 Now baby won't you come with me 
 'Cause down the shore everything's all right

84,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Ain't Got You,"I got the fortunes of heaven in diamonds and gold 
 I got all the bonds baby that the bank could hold 
 I got houses 'cross the country honey end to end 
 And everybody buddy wants to be my friend 
 Well I got all the riches baby any man ever knew 
 But the only thing I ain't got honey I ain't got you 
 I got a house full of Rembrandt and priceless art 
 And all the little girls they wanna tear me apart 
 When I walk down the street people stop and stare 
 Well you'd think I might be thrilled but baby I don't care 
 'Cause I got more good luck honey than old King Farouk 
 But the only thing I ain't got baby I ain't got you 
 I got a big diamond watch sittin' on my wrist 
 I try to tempt you baby but you just resist 
 I made a deal with the devil babe I won't deny 
 Until I got you in my arms I can't be satisfied 
 I got a pound of caviar sitting home on ice 
 I got a fancy foreign car that rides like paradise 
 I got a hundred pretty women knockin' down my door 
 And folks wanna kiss me I ain't even seen before 
 I been around the world and all across the seven seas 
 Been paid a king's ransom for doin' what comes naturally 
 But I'm still the biggest fool honey this world ever knew 
 'Cause the only thing I ain't got baby I ain't got you"
85,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Tougher Than The Rest,"Well, it's Saturday night 
 You're all dressed up in blue 
 I been watching you awhile 
 Maybe you been watching me too 
 So somebody ran out 
 Left somebody's heart in a mess 
 Well, if you're looking for love 
 Honey, I'm tougher than the rest 
 Some girls they want a handsome Dan 
 Or some good-lookin' Joe 
 On their arms some girls 
 Like a sweet-talkin' Romeo 
 Well, 'round here, baby 
 I learned you get what you can get 
 So if you're rough enough for love 
 Honey, I'm tougher than the rest 
 Yeah, the road is dark 
 And it's a thin, thin line 
 But I want you to know 
 I'll walk it for you any time 
 Maybe your other boyfriends 
 Couldn't pass the test 
 Well, if you're rough and ready for love 
 Honey, I'm tougher than the rest 
 Well, it ain't no secret 
 I've been around a time or two 
 Well, I don't know, baby 
 Maybe you've been around too 
 Well, there's another dance 
 All you gotta do is say yes 
 And if you're rough and ready for love 
 Honey, I'm tougher than the rest 
 If you're rough enough for love 
 Baby, I'm tougher than the rest"
86,Bruce Springsteen,rock,All That Heaven Will Allow,"I got a dollar in my pocket 
 There ain't a cloud up above

 Then fellas don't go lookin' now

 We'll make it through you somehow 
 We'll fill this house with all the love

87,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Spare Parts,"Bobby said he'd pull out Bobby stayed in 
 Janey had a baby it wasn't any sin 
 They were set to marry on a summer day 
 Bobby got scared and he ran away 
 Jane moved in with her ma out on Shawnee Lake 
 She sighed Ma sometimes my whole life feels like one big mistake 
 She settled in in a back room time passed on 
 Later that winter a son came along 
 Spare parts 
 And broken hearts 
 Keep the world turnin' around 
 Now Janey walked that baby across the floor night after night 
 But she was a young girl and she missed the party lights 
 Meanwhile in South Texas in a dirty oil patch 
 Bobby heard 'bout his son bein' born and swore he wasn't ever goin' back 
 Spare parts 
 And broken hearts 
 Keep the world turnin' around 
 Janey heard about a woman over in Calverton 
 Put her baby in the river let the river roll on 
 She looked at her boy in the crib where he lay 
 Got down on her knees cried till she prayed 
 Mist was on the water low run the tide 
 Janey held her son down at the riverside 
 Waist deep in water how bright the sun shone 
 She lifted him in her arms and carried him home 
 As he lay sleeping in her bed Janey took a look around at everything 
 Went to a drawer in her bureau and got out her old engagement ring 
 Took out her wedding dress tied that ring up in its sash 
 Went straight down to the pawn shop man and walked out with some good cold cash 
 Spare parts 
 And broken hearts 
 Keep the world turnin' around"
88,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Cautious Man,"Bill Horton was a cautious man of the road. 
 He walked lookin' over his shoulder, 
 And remained faithful to its code. 
 When something caught his eye, 
 He'd measure his need, 
 And then very carefully he'd proceed. 
 Billy met a young girl, 
 In the early days of May. 
 It was there in her arms, 
 He let his cautiousness slip away. 
 In their lovers twilight, 
 As the evening sky grew dim, 
 He'd lay back in her arms, 
 And laugh at what had happened to him. 
 On his right hand Billy'd tattooed the word love, 
 And on his left hand was the word fear, 
 And in which hand he held his fate, 
 Was never clear. 
 Come Indian summer he took his young lover for his bride. 
 And with his own hands, 
 Built her a great house down by the riverside. 
 Now Billy was a honest man, 
 He wanted to do what was right. 
 He worked hard to fill their lives 
 With happy days and loving nights. 
 Alone on his knees in the darkness, 
 For steadiness he'd pray. 
 For he knew in a restless heart, 
 The seeds of betrayal lay. 
 One nght Billy awoke from a terrible dream 
 Callin' his wife's name. 
 She lay breathing beside him in a peaceful sleep. 
 A thousand miles away. 
 He got dressed in the moonlight, 
 And down to the highway he strode. 
 When he got there, 
 He didn't find nothing but road. 
 Billy felt a coldness rise up inside him 
 That he couldn't name. 
 Just as the words tattooed 'cross his knuckles, 
 He knew would always remain. 
 At their bedside he brushed the hair from his wife's face. 
 As the moon shone on her skin so white, 
 Bathing their room in the beauty 
 Of God's fallen light."
89,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Walk Like A Man,"I remember how rough your hand felt on mine 
 On my wedding day 
 And the tears cried on my shoulder 
 I couldn't turn away 
 Well so much has happened to me 
 That I don't understand 
 All I can think of is being five years old following behind you at the beach 
 Tracing your footprints in the sand 
 Trying to walk like a man 
 By Our Lady Of The Roses 
 We lived in the shadow of the elms 
 I remember ma draggin' me and my sister up the street to the church 
 Whenever she heard those wedding bells 
 Well would they ever look so happy again 
 The handsome groom and his bride 
 As they stepped into that long black limousine 
 For their mystery ride 
 Well tonight you step away from me 
 And alone at the alter I stand 
 And as I watch my bride coming down the aisle I pray 
 For the strength to walk like a man 
 Well now the years have gone and I've grown 
 From that seed you've sown 
 But I didn't think there'd be so many steps 
 I'd have to learn on my own 
 Well I was young and I didn't know what to do 
 When I saw your best steps stolen away from you 
 Now I'll do what I can 
 I'll walk like a man 
 And I'll keep on walkin'"
90,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Tunnel Of Love,"Fat man sitting on a little stool 
 Takes the money from my hand while his eyes take a walk all over you 
 Hands me the ticket, smiles and whispers: ""Good luck"" 
 Well, cuddle up angel, cuddle up my little dove 
 We'll ride down, baby, into this tunnel of love 
 Well, I feel the soft silk of your blouse 
 And them soft thrills in our little fun house 
 Then the lights go out and it's just the three of us, yeah 
 You, me and all that stuff we're so scared of 
 Gotta ride down, baby, into this tunnel of love 
 Well, there's a crazy mirror showing us both in 5-D 
 I'm laughing at you, you're laughing at me 
 There's a room of shadows that gets so dark, brother 
 It's easy for two people to lose each other in this tunnel of love 
 Well, it ought to be easy, ought to be simple enough, yeah 
 Man meets woman and they fall in love 
 But this house is haunted and the ride gets rough 
 You've got to learn to live with what you can't rise above 
 If you wanna ride on down, down in through this tunnel of love 
 Tunnel of love 
 This tunnel of love 
 This tunnel of love 
 Oh, ooh 
 Yeah oh, ooh 
 Yeah oh, ooh 
 Sha na na na, na na na na, oh 
 Sha na na na, na na na na, oh 
 Sha na na na, na na na na, oh 
 Sha na na na, na na na na, oh"
91,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Two Faces,"I met a girl and we ran away 
 I swore I'd make her happy every day 
 And how I made her cry 
 Two faces have I 
 Sometimes mister I feel sunny and wild 
 Lord I love to see my baby smile 
 Then dark clouds come rolling by 
 Two faces have I 
 One that laughs one that cries 
 One says hello one says goodbye 
 One does things I don't understand 
 Makes me feel like half a man 
 At night I get down on my knees and pray 
 Our love will make that other man go away 
 But he'll never say goodbye 
 Two faces have I 
 Last night as I kissed you 'neath the willow tree 
 He swore he'd take your love away from me 
 He said our life was just a lie 
 And two faces have I 
 Well go ahead and let him try"
92,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Brilliant Disguise,"I hold you in my arms 
 As the band plays 
 What are those words whispered, baby 
 Just as you turn away 
 I saw you last night 
 Out on the edge of town 
 I want to read your mind to know 
 Just what I've got in this new thing I've found 
 So tell me what I see 
 When I look in your eyes 
 Is that you, baby 
 Or just a brilliant disguise? 
 I heard somebody call your name 
 From underneath our willow 
 I saw something tucked in shame 
 Underneath your pillow 
 Well, I've tried so hard baby 
 But I just can't see 
 Oh, what a woman like you 
 Is doing with me 
 So tell me who I see 
 When I look in your eyes 
 Is that you, baby 
 Or just a brilliant disguise? 
 Now look at me, baby 
 Struggling to do everything right 
 And then it all falls apart 
 Oh, when out go the lights 
 I'm just a lonely pilgrim 
 I walk this world in wealth 
 I want to know if it's you I don't trust 
 'Cause I damn sure don't trust myself 
 Now, you play the loving woman 
 I'll play the faithful man 
 But just don't look too close 
 Into the palm of my hand 
 Oh, we stood at the altar 
 The gypsy swore our future was bright 
 But come the wee wee hours 
 Well maybe, baby, the gypsy lied 
 So when you look at me 
 You better look hard and look twice 
 Is that me, baby 
 Or just a brilliant disguise? 
 Tonight our bed is cold 
 I'm lost in the darkness of our love 
 God have mercy on the man 
 Who doubts what he's sure of"
93,Bruce Springsteen,rock,One Step Up,"Woke up this morning, the house was cold 
 Checked the furnace, she wasn't burnin' 
 Went out and hopped in my old Ford 
 Hit the engine but she ain't turnin' 
 We've given each other some hard lessons lately 
 But we ain't learnin' 
 And we're the same sad story, that's a fact 
 One step up and two steps back 
 Bird on a wire outside my motel room 
 But he ain't singin' 
 Girl in white outside a church in June 
 But the church bells they ain't ringin' 
 I'm sitting here in this bar tonight 
 But all I'm thinkin' 
 Is I'm the same old story, same old act 
 One step up and two steps back 
 It's the same thing night on night 
 Who's wrong, baby, who's right 
 Another fight and I slam the door 
 On another battle in our dirty little war 
 When I look at myself I don't see 
 The man I wanted to be 
 Somewhere along the line I slipped off track 
 I'm caught moving one step up and two steps back 
 There's a girl across the bar 
 I get the message she's sendin' 
 Mmm, she ain't looking too married 
 And me, well, honey, I'm pretending 
 Last night I dreamed I held you in my arms 
 The music was never-ending 
 We danced as the evening sky faded to black 
 One step up and two steps back (One step up and two steps back) 
 One step up and two steps back (One step up and two steps back) 
 One step up and two steps back"
94,Bruce Springsteen,rock,When You're Alone,"Times were tough 
 And love was not enough 
 So you said, ""sorry Johnny, I'm gone gone gone"" 
 You said my act was funny 
 But we both knew what was missing, honey 
 So you let out on your own 
 Now that pretty form that you've got, baby 
 Will make sure you get along 
 But you're gonna find out some day, honey 
 When you're alone you're alone 
 When you're alone you're alone 
 When you're alone you're alone 
 When you're alone you ain't nothing but alone 
 Now, I was young and pretty 
 On the mean streets of the city 
 And I fought to make 'em my home 
 With just the shirt on my back 
 I left and swore I'd never look back 
 And, man, I was gone gone gone 
 But there's things that'll knock you down you don't even see coming 
 And send you crawling like a baby back home 
 You're gonna find out that day, sugar 
 When you're alone you're alone 
 When you're alone you're alone 
 When you're alone you're alone 
 When you're alone you ain't nothing but alone 
 Well, I knew some day your running would be through 
 And you'd think back on me and you 
 And your love would be strong 
 You'd forget all the bad 
 And think only of all the laughs that we had 
 And you'd want to come home 
 Now it ain't hard feelings or nothing, sugar 
 That ain't what's got me singing this song 
 It's just nobody knows, honey, where love goes 
 But when it goes it's gone gone 
 And when you're alone you're alone 
 When you're alone you're alone 
 When you're alone you're alone 
 When you're alone you ain't nothing but alone 
 When you're alone you're alone 
 When you're alone you're alone 
 When you're alone you're alone 
 When you're alone you ain't nothing but alone"
95,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Valentine's Day,"I'm driving a big lazy car, rushing up the highway in the dark 
 I got one hand steady on the wheel and one hand's trembling over my heart 
 And it's pounding, baby, like it's gonna bust right on through 
 And it ain't gonna stop 'til I'm alone again with you 
 A friend of mine became a father last night 
 When we spoke, in his voice, I could hear the light 
 Of the skies and the rivers the timberwolf in the pines 
 And that great jukebox out on Route 39 
 They say he travels fastest who travels alone 
 But tonight I miss my girl, mister, tonight I miss my home 
 Is it the sound of the leaves left blown by the wayside 
 That's got me out here on this spooky old highway tonight 
 Is it the cry of the river with the moonlight shining through 
 That ain't what scares me, baby, what scares me is losing you 
 They say if you die in your dreams, you really die in your bed 
 But, honey, last night I dreamed my eyes rolled straight back in my head 
 And God's light came shining on through 
 I woke up in the darkness, scared and breathing and born anew 
 It wasn't the cold river bottom I felt rushing over me 
 It wasn't the bitterness of a dream that didn't come true 
 It wasn't the wind in the grey fields I felt rushing through my arms 
 No, no, baby, baby it was you 
 So hold me close, honey, say you're forever mine 
 And tell me you'll be my lonely valentine 
 Lonely valentine"
96,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Be True,"Your scrapbook's filled with pictures of all your leading men 
 Well baby don't put my picture in there with them 
 Don't make us some little girl's dream that can't ever come true 
 That only serves to hurt and make you cry like you do 
 Well baby don't do it to me and I won't do it to you 
 You see all the romantic movies, you dream and take the boys home 
 But when the action fades you're left all alone 
 You deserve better than this, little girl, can't you see that you do 
 Do you need somebody to prove it to you? 
 Well you prove it to me and I'll prove it to you 
 Now every night you go out looking for true love's satisfaction 
 But in the morning you end up settling for just lights, camera, action 
 And another cameo role with some bit player you're befriending 
 You're gonna go broken-hearted looking for that happy ending 
 Well girl you're gonna end up just another lonely ticket sold 
 Cryin' alone in the theater as the credits roll 
 You say I'll be like those other guys 
 Who filled your head with pretty lies 
 And dreams that can never come true 
 Well baby you be true to me 
 And I'll be true to you"
97,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Chimes Of Freedom,"Well far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll 
 We ducked inside the doorway thunder crashin' 
 As majestic bells of boats struck shadows in the sun 
 Sayin' it may be the chimes of freedom flashin' 
 Flashin' for the warriors whose strength is not to fight 
 Flashin' for the refugees on their unarmed road of flight 
 And for each and every underdog soldier in the night 
 We gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin' 
 Well in the city's melted furnace unexpectedly we watched 
 With faces hidden here while the walls were tightenin' 
 As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowing rain 
 Dissolved into the wild bales of lightnin' 
 Yeah tollin' for the rebel yeah tollin' for the raked 
 Tollin' for the luckless the abandoned and forsaked 
 Yeah tollin' for the outcasts burnin' constantly at stakes 
 And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin' 
 And then through a cloud-like curtain in a far off corner flashed 
 There's a hypnotic splattered mist was slowly liftin' 
 Well electric light still struck like arrows 
 Fired but for the ones condemned to drift or else be kept from driftin' 
 Well tollin' for the searching ones on this speechless secret trail 
 For the lonesome haunted lovers with too personal a tale 
 And for each young heart for each channeled soul misplaced inside a jail 
 Yeah we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin' 
 Well starry eyed and laughin' I recall when we were caught 
 Trapped by an old track of vows for the hands suspended 
 As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look 
 Spellbound and swallowed ""Has the tollin' ended?"" 
 Yeah tollin' for the achin' ones whose wounds cannot be nursed 
 For the countless confused accused misused strung out ones at worst 
 And for every hung out person in the whole wide universe 
 We gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'"
98,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Human Touch,"You and me we were the pretenders 
 We let it all slip away 
 In the end what you don't surrender 
 Well, the world just strips away 
 Girl, ain't no kindness in the face of strangers 
 Ain't gonna find no miracles here 
 Well, you can wait on your blessings, my darling 
 I got a deal for you right here 
 I ain't looking for praise or pity 
 I ain't coming 'round searching for a crutch 
 I just want someone to talk to 
 And a little of that human touch 
 Just a little of that human touch 
 Ain't no mercy on the streets of this town 
 Ain't no bread from heavenly skies 
 Ain't nobody drawing wine from this blood 
 It's just you and me tonight 
 Tell me, in a world without pity 
 Do you think what I'm askin's too much? 
 I just want something to hold on to 
 And a little of that human touch 
 Just a little of that human touch 
 Oh, girl, that feeling of safety you prize 
 Well, it comes with a hard, hard price 
 You can't shut off the risk and the pain 
 Without losing the love that remains 
 We're all riders on this train 
 So you've been broken and you've been hurt 
 Show me somebody who ain't 
 Yeah I know, I ain't nobody's bargain 
 But hell, a little touch up and a little paint 
 You might need something to hold on to 
 When all the answers, they don't amount to much 
 Somebody that you could just to talk to 
 And a little of that human touch 
 Baby, in a world without pity 
 Do you think what I'm askin's too much? 
 I just want to feel you in my arms 
 And share a little of that human touch 
 Share a little of that human touch 
 Feel a little of that human touch and you 
 Feel a little of that human touch 
 Share a little of that human touch I want 
 Feel a little of that human touch 
 Give me a little of that human touch and you 
 Give me a little of that human touch 
 Hey, yeah 
 Alright 
 Alright now 
 (Give me a little of that human touch) 
 Ooh"
99,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Soul Driver,"Rode through 40 nights of the gospels' rain 
 Black sky pourin' snakes and frogs 
 And love in vain 
 You were down where the river grows wider 
 Baby, let me be your soul driver 
 Well if something in the air feels a little unkind 
 Don't worry, darlin' 
 It'll slip your mind 
 I'll be your gypsy joker your shotgun rider 
 Baby, let me be your soul driver 
 Now no one knows which way love's wheel turns 
 Will we hit it rich 
 Or crash and burn 
 Does fortune wait or just the black hand of fate 
 This love potion's all we've got 
 One toast before it's too late 
 If the angels are unkind or the season is dark 
 Or if in the end 
 Love just falls apart 
 Then here's to our destruction 
 Baby, let me be your soul driver"
100,Bruce Springsteen,rock,57 Channels (And Nothin' On),"I bought a bourgeois house in the Hollywood hills 
 With a trunkload of hundred thousand dollar bills 
 Man came by to hook up my cable TV 
 We settled in for the night my baby and me 
 We switched 'round and 'round 'til half-past dawn 
 There was fifty-seven channels and nothin' on 
 Fifty-seven channels and nothin' on 
 Fifty-seven channels and nothin' on 
 Well, now home entertainment was my baby's wish 
 So I hopped into town for a satellite dish 
 I tied it to the top of my Japanese car 
 I came home and I pointed it out into the stars 
 A message came back from the great beyond 
 There's fifty-seven channels and nothin' on 
 Fifty-seven channels and nothin' on 
 Fifty-seven channels and nothin' on 
 Well, we might'a made some friends with some billionaires 
 We might'a got all nice and friendly if we'd made it upstairs 
 All I got was a note that said ""Bye-bye John 
 Our love is fifty-seven channels and nothin' on"" 
 (Fifty-seven channels and nothin' on) 
 So I bought a .44 Magnum, it was solid steel cast 
 And in the blessed name of Elvis well I just let it blast 
 'Til my TV lay in pieces there at my feet 
 And they busted me for disturbin' the almighty peace 
 Judge said ""What you got in your defense son?"" 
 Fifty-seven channels and nothin' on 
 Fifty-seven channels and nothin' on 
 Fifty-seven channels and nothin' on 
 I can see by your eyes friend you're just about gone 
 Fifty-seven channels and nothin' on 
 Fifty-seven channels and nothin' on 
 Fifty-seven channels and nothin' on 
 Fifty-seven channels and nothin' on 
 Fifty-seven channels and...nothin' on"
101,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Cross My Heart,"First time I crossed my heart 
 I was beggin' baby, please 
 At your bedside, down on my knees 
 When I crossed my heart 
 When I crossed my heart 
 I crossed my heart, pretty baby over you 
 Second time I crossed my heart 
 Rain came in from the south 
 I was lyin' there with something sweet and salty in my mouth 
 When I crossed my heart 
 When I crossed my heart 
 When I crossed my heart, pretty darlin' over you 
 Well, you may think the world's black and white 
 And you're dirty or you're clean 
 You better watch out you don't slip 
 Through them spaces in between 
 Where the night gets sticky 
 And the sky gets black 
 I grabbed you, baby, and you grabbed me back 
 And we crossed our hearts 
 We crossed our hearts 
 Yeah, I crossed my heart... 
 Little boys, little girls 
 They know their wrongs from their rights 
 Once you cross your heart 
 You ain't ever supposed to lie 
 Well, life ain't nothin' 
 But a cold hard ride 
 I ain't leavin' 'til I'm satisfied 
 I cross my heart 
 Yeah, I cross my heart 
 Well, I cross my heart, pretty darlin' over you"
102,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Gloria's Eyes,"I was your big man I was your prince charming 
 King on a white horse hey now look how far I've fallen 
 I tried to trick you yeah but baby you got wise 
 You cut me cut me right down to size 
 Now I'm just a fool in Gloria's eyes 
 Swore I'd get you back I was so sure 
 I'd get you back like I done so many times before 
 A little sweet talk to cover over all of the lies 
 You came runnin' back but to my surprise 
 Well there was somethin' gone in Gloria's eyes 
 Well in the dark when it was just me and you 
 I asked the question that I knew the answer to 
 Is that a smile my little dolly on the shelf 
 Tell me is that a smile 
 Or is it something else? 
 Now I work hard to prove my love is true 
 Now I work hard and I bring it on home to you 
 At night I pray as silently you lie 
 Some day my love again will rise 
 Like a shining torch in Gloria's eyes 
 I was your big man your prince charming 
 King on a white horse now look how far I've fallen"
103,Bruce Springsteen,rock,With Every Wish,"Ol' catfish in the lake, we called him Big Jim 
 When I was a kid, my only wish was to get my line in him 
 Skipped church one Sunday rowed out and throw'd in my line 
 Jim took that hook pole and me right over the side 
 Went driftin' down past old tires and rusty cans of beer 
 The angel of the lake whispered in my ear 
 ""Before you chose your wish son 
 You better think first 
 With every wish there comes a curse"" 
 I fell in love with beautiful Doreen 
 She was the prettiest thing this old town'd ever seen 
 I courted her and I made her mine 
 But I grew jealous whenever another man'd 
 Come walkin' down the line 
 And my jealousy made me treat her mean and cruel 
 She sighed, ""Bobby oh Bobby you're such a fool 
 Don't you know before you choose your wish 
 You'd better think first 
 'Cause with every wish there comes a curse"" 
 These days I sit around and laugh 
 At the many rivers I've crossed 
 But on the far banks there's always another forest 
 Where a man can get lost 
 Well there in the high trees love's bluebird glides 
 Guiding us 'cross to another river on the other side 
 And there someone is waitin' with a look in her eyes 
 And though my heart's grown weary 
 And more than a little bit shy 
 Tonight I'll drink from her waters to quench my thirst 
 And leave the angels to worry 
 With every wish..."
104,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Roll Of The Dice,"Well I've been a losin' gambler 
 Just throwin' snake eyes 
 Love ain't got me downhearted 
 I know up around the corner lies 
 My fool's paradise 
 In just another roll of the dice 
 All my elevens and sevens been comin' up 
 Sixes and nines 
 But since I fell for you baby 
 Been comin' on changin' times 
 They're just waitin' over the rise 
 Just another roll of the dice 
 I've stumbled and I know I made my mistakes 
 But tonight I'm gonna be playin' for all of the stakes 
 Well it's never too late so come on girl 
 The tables are waiting 
 You and me and lady luck well tonight 
 We'll be celebrating 
 Drinkin' champagne on ice 
 In just another roll of the dice 
 High-rollers lay down your bets and I'll raise 'em 
 Well I know the odds ain't in my favor 
 Maybe I'm just a clown throwin' down 
 Lookin' to come up busted 
 I'm a thief in the house of love 
 And I can't be trusted 
 Well I'll be making my heist 
 In just another roll of the dice 
 Move on up 
 Come on seven 
 Roll me baby 
 In this fool's heaven"
105,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Real World,"Mister Trouble come walkin' this way 
 Year gone by feels like one long day 
 But I'm alive and I'm feelin' all right 
 Well I run that hard road outta heartbreak city 
 Built a roadside carnival out of hurt and self-pity 
 It was all wrong well now I'm moving on 
 Ain't no church bells ringing 
 Ain't no flags unfurled 
 It's just me and you and the love we're bringing 
 Into the real world 
 Into the real world 
 I built a shrine in my heart it wasn't pretty to see 
 Made out of fool's gold memory and tears cried 
 Now I'm headin' over the rise 
 I'm searchin' for one clear moment of love and truth 
 I still got a little faith 
 But what I need is some proof tonight 
 I'm lookin' for it in your eyes 
 Ain't no church bells ringing 
 Ain't no flags unfurled 
 Just me and you and the faith we're bringing 
 Into the real world 
 Into the real world 
 Well tonight I just wanna shout 
 I feel my soul waist deep and sinkin' 
 Into this black river of doubt 
 I just wanna rise and walk along the riverside 
 And when the morning comes baby I don't wanna hide 
 I'll stand right at your side with my arms open wide 
 Well tonight I just wanna shout 
 I feel my soul waist deep and sinkin' 
 Into this black river of doubt 
 I just wanna rise and walk along the riverside 
 'Til the morning comes 
 I'll stand right by your side 
 I wanna find some answers I wanna ask for some help 
 I'm tired of running scared 
 Baby let's get our bags packed 
 We'll take it here to hell and heaven and back 
 And if love is hopeless hopeless at best 
 Come on put on your party dress it's ours tonight 
 And we're goin' with the tumblin' dice 
 Ain't no church bells ringing 
 Ain't no flags unfurled 
 It's just me and you and the hope we're bringing 
 Into the real world 
 Well into the real world

106,Bruce Springsteen,rock,All Or Nothin' At All,"Said you'd give me just a little kiss 
 And you'd rock me for a little while 
 Well you'd slip me just a piece of it 
 Listen up little child 
 I Want it all or nothin' at all 
 I Want it all or nothin' at all 
 Said you'd take me for a little dance 
 If you had a little time on your hands 
 Well all I do is push and shove 
 Just to get a little piece of your love 
 I want it all or nothin' at all 
 I want it all or nothin' at all 
 Well now I don't wanna be greedy 
 But when it comes to love there ain't no doubt 
 You just ain't gonna get what you want 
 With one foot in bed and one foot out 
 You got to give it all or nothin' at all 
 All or nothin' at all 
 Now I only got a little time 
 So if you're gonna change your mind 
 Then shout out what you're thinkin' of 
 If what you're thinkin' of is love

 Your hand's on his neck as the music sways 
 All my illusions slip away 
 Now if you're lookin' for a hero 
 Someone to save the day 
 Well darlin' my feet 
 They're made of clay 
 But I've got something in my soul 
 And I wanna give it up 
 But gettin' up the nerve

108,Bruce Springsteen,rock,I Wish I Were Blind,"I love to see the cottonwood blossom 
 In the early spring 
 I love to see the message of love 
 That the bluebird brings 
 But when I see you walkin' with him 
 Down along the strand 
 I wish I were blind 
 When I see you with your man 
 I love to see your hair shining 
 In the long summer's light 
 I love to watch the stars fill the sky 
 On a summer night 
 Music plays, you take his hand 
 I watch how you touch him as you start to dance 
 And I wish I were blind 
 When I see you with your man 
 We struggle here but all our love's in vain 
 And these eyes that once filled me with your beauty 
 Now fill me with pain 
 And the light that once entered here 
 Is banished from me 
 And this darkness is all baby that my heart sees 
 And though this world is filled 
 With the grace and beauty of God's hand 
 Oh I wish I were blind 
 When I see you with your man 
 We struggle here but all our love's in vain 
 And these eyes that once filled me with your beauty 
 Now fill me with pain 
 And the light that once entered here 
 Is banished from me 
 And this darkness is all baby that my heart sees 
 And though this world is filled 
 With the grace and beauty of God's hand 
 Oh I wish I were blind 
 When I see you with your man 
 When I see you with your man 
 When I see you with your man"
109,Bruce Springsteen,rock,The Long Goodbye,"My soul went walkin' but I stayed here 
 Feel like I been workin' for a thousand years 
 Chippin' away at this chain of my own lies 
 Climbin' a wall a hundred thousand miles high 
 Well I woke up this morning on the other side 
 Yeah yeah this is the long goodbye 
 Hey yeah this is the long goodbye 
 Same old faces it's the same old town 
 What once was laughs is draggin' me now 
 Wailin' on rain hangin' on for love 
 Words of forgiveness from some God above 
 Ain't no words of mercy comin' from on high 
 Oh no just a long goodbye 
 Yeah yeah just one long goodbye 
 Well I went to leave twenty years ago 
 Since then I guess I been packin' kinda slow 
 Sure did like that admirin' touch 
 Guess I like'd it a little too much 
 The moon is high and here I am 
 Sittin' here with this hammer in hand 
 One more drink oughta ease the pain 
 Starin' at that last link in the chain 
 Well let's raise our glass and let this hammer fly 
 Hey yeah this is the long goodbye 
 Hey yeah this is the long goodbye 
 Kiss me baby and we're gonna fly 
 Hey yeah this is the long goodbye 
 Yeah yeah this is the long goodbye 
 Hey yeah this is the long goodbye 
 Kiss me baby 'cause we're gonna ride 
 Yeah yeah this is the long goodbye"
110,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Real Man,"Took my baby to a picture show 
 Found a seat in the back row 
 Sound came up lights went down 
 Rambo he was blowin' 'em down 
 I don't need no gun in my fist baby 
 All I need is your sweet kiss 
 To get me feelin' like a real man 
 Feelin' like a real man 
 Well you can beat on your chest 
 Hell any monkey can 
 But you got me feelin' like a real man 
 Oh feelin' like a real man 
 Me and my girl Saturday night 
 Late movie on channel five 
 The girls were droppin' they're droppin' like flies 
 To some smooth talkin' cool walkin' private eye 
 I ain't got no nerves of steel 
 But all I got to know is if your love is real 
 To get me feelin' like a real man 
 Oh feelin' like a real man 
 Well you can beat on your chest 
 Hell any monkey can 
 But you got me feelin' like a real man 
 Oh feelin' like a real man 
 I ain't no fighter that's easy to see 
 And as a lover I ain't goin' down in history 
 But when the lights go down and you pull me close 
 Well I look in your eyes and there's one thing I know 
 Baby I'll be tough enough 
 If I can find the guts to give you all my love 
 Then I'll be feelin' like a real man 
 Feelin' like a real man 
 Well you can beat on your chest 
 Hell any monkey can 
 You got me feelin' like a real man 
 Oh feelin' like a real man 
 Yeah I been feelin' like a real man 
 Feelin' like a real man"
111,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Pony Boy,"Pony boy pony boy 
 Won't you be my pony boy 
 Giddy-up giddy-up giddy-up whoa 
 My pony boy 
 Ride with me ride with me 
 Won't you take a ride with me 
 Underneath the starry sky 
 My pony boy 
 O'ver the hills and through the trees 
 We'll go ridin' you and me 
 Giddy-up giddy-up giddy-up whoa 
 My pony boy 
 Down into the valley deep 
 'Neath the eaves we will sleep 
 Sky of dreams up above 
 My pony boy"
112,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Better Days,"Well, my soul checked out missing as I sat listening 
 To the hours and minutes tickin' away 
 Yeah, just sittin' around waitin' for my life to begin 
 While it was all just slippin' away 
 And I'm tired of waitin' for tomorrow to come 
 For that train to come roarin' 'round the bend 
 I got a new suit of clothes and a pretty red rose 
 And a woman I can call my friend 
 These are better days, baby 
 Yeah, there's better days shining through 
 These are better days, baby 
 Better days with a girl like you 
 Well, I took a piss at fortune's sweet kiss 
 It's like eatin' caviar and dirt 
 It's a sad funny ending to find yourself pretending 
 You're a rich man in a poor man's shirt 
 Now my ass was draggin' when from a passin' gypsy wagon 
 Your heart like a diamond shone 
 Tonight I'm layin' in your arms carvin' lucky charms 
 Out of these hard luck bones 
 These are better days, baby 
 These are better days, it's true 
 These are better days, baby 
 There's better days shining through 
 Now a life of leisure and a pirate's treasure 
 Don't make much for tragedy 
 But it's a sad man, my friend, who's livin' in his own skin 
 And can't stand the company 
 Every fool's got a reason to feelin' sorry for himself 
 And turnin' his heart to stone 
 Tonight this fool's halfway to heaven and just a mile outta hell 
 And I feel like I'm comin' home 
 These are better days, baby 
 There's better days shining through 
 These are better days, baby 
 Better days with a girl like you 
 These are better days, baby 
 These are better days, it's true 
 These are better days 
 Better days are shining through 
 These are better days, baby 
 Ah, better days, it's true 
 These are better days, baby 
 Better days are shining through 
 These are better days, baby 
 Ah, better days, it's true 
 These are better days, baby 
 Better days are shining through"
113,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Lucky Town,"Yeah, house got too crowded, clothes got too tight 
 And I don't know just where I'm going tonight 
 Out where the sky's been cleared by a good hard rain 
 There's somebody calling my secret name 
 I'm going down to Lucky Town 
 Going down to Lucky Town 
 I wanna lose these blues I've found 
 Down in Lucky Town 
 Baby, down in Lucky Town 
 Had a coat of fine leather and snakeskin boots 
 But that coat always had a thread hanging loose 
 Well, I pulled it one night and to my surprise 
 It led me right past your house and on over the rise 
 I'm going down to Lucky Town 
 Down to Lucky Town 
 I wanna lose these blues I've found 
 Down in Lucky Town 
 Baby, down in Lucky Town 
 Well, I had some victory that was just failure in deceit 
 Now the joke's coming up through the soles of my feet 
 I been a long time walking on fortune's cane 
 Well, tonight, I'm stepping lightly and feeling no pain 
 Well, here's to your good looks, baby, now here's to my health 
 Here's to the loaded places that we take ourselves 
 When it comes to luck, you make your own 
 Tonight, I got dirt on my hands but I'm building me a new home 
 Take me down to Lucky Town 
 Down to Lucky Town 
 I'm gonna lose these blues I've found 
 Down in Lucky Town 
 Baby, down in Lucky Town 
 I'm going down to Lucky Town 
 Down to Lucky Town 
 I'm gonna lose these blues I've found 
 Down in Lucky Town 
 Baby, down in Lucky Town

114,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Local Hero,"I was driving through my hometown 
 I was just kinda killin' time 
 When I seen a face staring out of a black velvet painting 
 From the window of the five and dime 
 I couldn't quite recall the name 
 But the pose looked familiar to me 
 So I asked the salesgirl ""Who was that man 
 Between the doberman and Bruce Lee?"" 
 She said ""Just a local hero"" 
 ""Local hero"" she said with a smile 
 ""Yeah a local hero he used to live here for awhile"" 
 I met a stranger dressed in black 
 At the train station 
 He said ""Son your soul can be saved"" 
 There's beautiful women nights of low livin' 
 And some dangerous money to be made 
 There's a big town 'cross the whiskey line 
 And if we turn the right cards up 
 They make us boss the devil pays off 
 And them folks that are real hard up 
 They get their local hero 
 Somebody with the right style 
 They get their local hero 
 Somebody with just the right smile 
 Well I learned my job I learned it well 
 Fit myself with religion and a story to tell 
 First they made me the king then they made me pope 
 Then they brought the rope 
 I woke to a gypsy girl sayin' ""Drink this"" 
 Well my hands had lost all sensation 
 These days I'm feeling all right 
 'Cept I can't tell my courage from my desperation 
 From the tainted chalice 
 Well I drunk some heady wine 
 Tonight I'm layin' here 
 But there's somethin' in my ear 
 Sayin' there's a little town just beneath the floodline 
 Needs a local hero 
 Somebody with the right style 
 Lookin' for a local hero 
 Someone with the right smile 
 Local hero local hero she said with a smile 
 Local hero he used to live here for awhile"
115,Bruce Springsteen,rock,If I Should Fall Behind,"We said we'd walk together, baby, come what may 
 That come the twilight should we lose our way 
 If as we're walking a hand should slip free 
 I'll wait for you, should I fall behind, wait for me 
 We swore we'd travel, darling, side by side 
 We'd help each other stay in stride 
 But each lover's steps fall so differently 
 But I'll wait for you, and if I should fall behind, wait for me 
 Now everyone dreams of love lasting and true 
 Oh, but you and I know what this world can do 
 So let's make our steps clear that the other may see 
 And I'll wait for you, and if I should fall behind, wait for me 
 Now there's a beautiful river in the valley ahead 
 There 'neath the oak's bough soon we will be wed 
 Should we lose each other in the shadow of the evening trees 
 I'll wait for you, should I fall behind, wait for me 
 Darling, I'll wait for you, should I fall behind, wait for me 
 Yeah, I'll wait for you, should I fall behind, wait for me 
 I'll wait for you, should I fall behind, wait for me 
 ..."
116,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Leap Of Faith,"All over the world the rain was pourin' 
 I was scratchin' where it itched 
 Oh, heartbreak and despair got nothing but boring 
 So I grabbed you, baby, like a wild pitch 
 It takes a leap of faith to get things going 
 It takes a leap of faith, you gotta show some guts 
 It takes a leap of faith to get things going, yeah 
 In your heart you must trust 
 Now your legs were heaven, your breasts were the altar 
 Your body was the holy land 
 You shouted ""Jump"" but my heart faltered 
 You laughed and said: ""Baby, don't you understand?"" 
 It takes a leap of faith to get things going 
 It takes a leap of faith, you gotta show some guts 
 It takes a leap of faith to get things going, yeah 
 In your heart you must trust 
 Now you were the Red Sea, I was Moses 
 I kissed you and slipped into a bed of roses 
 The waters parted and love rushed inside 
 I was Jesus' son, yeah, sanctified 
 Tonight the moon's looking young but I'm feelin' younger 
 Neath a veil of dreams sweet blessings rain 
 Honey, I can feel the first breeze of summer 
 And in your love I'm born again 
 It takes a leap of faith to get things going 
 It takes a leap of faith, you gotta show some guts 
 It takes a leap of faith to get things going, yeah 
 In your heart you must trust 
 It takes a leap of faith to get things going 
 It takes a leap of faith, you gotta show some guts 
 It takes a leap of faith to get things going, yeah 
 In your heart, well, you must trust 
 It takes a leap of faith, yeaheah 
 It takes a leap of faith 
 It takes a leap of faith 
 Oh, ahahaha 
 It takes a leap of faith 
 It takes a leap of faith 
 It takes a leap of faith 
 In your heart, well, you must trust 
 It takes a leap of faith 
 It takes a leap of faith 
 It takes a leap of faith"
117,Bruce Springsteen,rock,The Big Muddy,"Billy had a mistress down on 'A' and 12th 
 She was that little somethin' that he did for himself 
 His own little secret didn't hurt nobody 
 Come the afternoon he'd take her wadin' 
 Waist deep in the big muddy 
 Waist deep in the big muddy 
 You start out standing but end up crawlin' 
 Got in some trouble and needed a hand from a friend of mine 
 This old friend he had a figure in mind 
 It was nothing illegal just a little bit funny 
 He said ""C'mon don't tell me that the rich don't know 
 Sooner or later it all comes down to money"" 
 And you're waist deep in the big muddy 
 Waist deep in the big muddy 
 You start on higher ground but end up crawlin' 
 Well I had a friend said ""You watch what you do 
 Poison snake bites you and you're poison too"" 
 How beautiful the river flows and the birds they sing 
 But you and I we're messier things 
 There ain't no one leavin' this world buddy 
 Without their shirttail dirty 
 Or their hands bloody 
 Waist deep in the big muddy 
 Waist deep in the big muddy 
 You start on higher ground but end up somehow crawlin' 
 Waist deep in the big muddy"
118,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Living Proof,"Well now on a summer night in a dusky room 
 Come a little piece of the Lord's undying light 
 Crying like he swallowed the fiery moon 
 In his mother's arms it was all the beauty I could take 
 Like the missing words to some prayer that I could never make 
 In a world so hard and dirty so fouled and confused 
 Searching for a little bit of God's mercy 
 I found living proof 
 I put my heart and soul I put 'em high upon a shelf 
 Right next to the faith the faith that I'd lost in myself 
 I went down into the desert city 
 Just tryin' so hard to shed my skin 
 I crawled deep into some kind of darkness 
 Lookin' to burn out every trace of who I'd been 
 You do some sad sad things baby 
 When it's your you 're tryin' to lose 
 You do some sad and hurtful things 
 I've seen living proof 
 You shot through my anger and rage 
 To show me my prison was just an open cage 
 There were no keys no guards 
 Just one frightened man and some old shadows for bars 
 Well now all that's sure on the boulevard 
 Is that life is just a house of cards 
 As fragile as each and every breath 
 Of this boy sleepin' in our bed 
 Tonight let's lie beneath the eaves 
 Just a close band of happy thieves 
 And when that train comes we'll get on board 
 And steal what we can from the treasures of the Lord 
 It's been along long drought baby 
 Tonight the rain's pourin' down on our roof 
 Looking for a little bit of God's mercy 
 I found living proof"
119,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Book Of Dreams,"I'm standing in the backyard, listening to the party inside 
 Tonight I'm drinking in the forgiveness this life provides 
 The scars we carry remain, but the pain slips away it seems 
 Oh, won't you, baby, be in my book of dreams 
 I'm watching you through the window with your girlfriends from back home 
 You're showing off your dress, there's laughter and a toast 
 From your daddy to the prettiest bride he's ever seen 
 Oh, won't you, baby, be in my book of dreams 
 In the darkness, my fingers slip across your skin, I feel your sweet reply 
 The room fades away and suddenly I'm way up high 
 Yeah, just holding you to me as through the window the moonlight streams 
 Oh, won't you, baby, be in my book of dreams 
 Now the ritual begins, and 'neath the wedding garland we meet as strangers 
 The dance floor is alive with beauty, myst'ry and danger 
 We dance out 'neath the stars' ancient light into the darkening trees 
 Oh, won't you, baby, be in my book of dreams"
120,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Souls Of The Departed,"On the road to Basra stood young Lieutenant Jimmy Bly 
 Detailed to go through the clothes of the soldiers who died 
 At night in dreams he sees their souls rise 
 Yeah, like dark geese into the Oklahoma sky 
 Well, this is a prayer for the souls of the departed 
 Those who've gone, left their babies brokenhearted 
 This is a prayer for the souls of the departed 
 Now Raphael Rodriguez was just seven years old 
 Shot down in a schoolyard by some East Compton Cholos 
 His mamma cried, ""My beautiful boy is dead"" 
 In the hills the self-made men just sighed and shook their heads 
 This is a prayer for the souls of the departed 
 Those who've gone, left their babies brokenhearted 
 Young lives over before they got started 
 This is a prayer for the souls of the departed 
 Tonight as I tuck my own son in bed 
 All I can think of is what if it would've been him instead 
 I want to build me a wall so high nothing can burn it down 
 Right here on my own piece of dirty ground 
 Now I ply my trade in the land of king dollar 
 Where you get paid and your silence passes as honor 
 And all the hatred and dirty little lies 
 Been written off the books and into decent men's eyes"
121,Bruce Springsteen,rock,My Beautiful Reward,"Well I sought gold and diamond rings 
 My own drug to ease the pain that living brings 
 Walked from the mountain to the valley floor 
 Searching for my beautiful reward 
 Searching for my beautiful reward 
 From a house on a hill a sacred light shines 
 I walk through these rooms but none of them are mine 
 Down empty hallways I went from door to door 
 Searching for my beautiful reward 
 Searching for my beautiful reward 
 Well your hair shone in the sun 
 I was so high I was the lucky one 
 Then I came crashing down like a drunk on a barroom floor 
 Searching for my beautiful reward 
 Searching for my beautiful reward 
 Tonight I can feel the cold wind at my back 
 I'm flyin' high over gray fields my feathers long and black 
 Down along the river's silent edge I soar 
 Searching for my beautiful reward 
 Searching for my beautiful reward"
122,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Red Headed Woman,"Well brunettes are fine man 
 And blondes are fun 
 But when it comes to getting a dirty job done 
 I'll take a red headed woman 
 A red headed woman 
 It takes a red headed woman 
 To get a dirty job done 
 Well listen up stud your lifes been wasted 
 Till you've got down on your knees and tasted 
 A red headed woman 
 A red headed woman 
 It takes a red headed woman 
 To get a dirty job done 
 Tight skirt, strawberry hair 
 Tell me what you've got baby, waiting under there 
 Big green eyes that look like, son 
 They can see every cheap thing that you've ever done 
 Well I don't know how many girls you've dated, man 
 But you ain't lived till you've had your tyres rotated 
 By a red headed woman 
 A red headed woman 
 It takes a red heade woman 
 To get a dirty job done"
123,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Light Of Day,"Well, I've been out of the woods for six days and nights, now 
 Well, I'm a little hot wired, but I'm feeling alright 
 I got some money in my pocket and a long, lean ride, yeah 
 I got to make it down to Galveston by Saturday night, now 
 Well, I'm a little down under, but I'm feeling O.K. 
 Got a little lost along the way 
 I'm just around the corner to the light of day 
 Well, I'm just around the corner to the light of day, yeah 
 Been driving five hundred miles, got five hundred to go, yeah 
 I got rock and roll music on the radio 
 I got a brother on a rig just off the Gulf Coast 
 He says the girls down there, well, they're really the most, man 
 Well, I'm a little down under, but I'm feeling O.K. 
 I got a little lost along the way 
 Just around the corner to the light of day, yeah 
 Just around the corner to the light of day, yeah 
 I'm just around the corner to the light of day, yeah 
 Just around the corner to the light of day, yeah 
 I'm driving 100 miles, 200 miles, 300 miles

 Train kept on a-rollin', going 700 miles, 800 miles, 900 miles, 1,000 miles, 2,000 miles, 3,000 miles 
 I came a long, long way tonight 
 All the way to Hollywood, California, via Sweden, via Paris, via Italian, via France, via via London, England, via the great state of New Jersey and halfway across the United States 
 I wanna thank y'all for invitin' me into your living room tonight 
 I know there's millions of ya out there 
 I know you're downhearted 
 I know you're disenchanted 
 I know you're disillusioned 
 I know there's 57 channels and nothing on 
 Just one thing I wanna know tonight 
 There's just one thing I wanna know 
 But first I want you to get up off your couch 
 I want you to put the popcorn down 
 I want you to come on over to the tv set 
 I want you to turn it up real loud 
 I want you to take off all your clothes now 
 And what I want to know is anybody alive out there? 
 Well, I got thrown out of work on the Kokomo 
 Don't ask me what I'm doing, I don't know 
 I hope he wasn't joking when he wrote me that letter 
 Things can't get any worse, they gotta get better 
 I'm a little down under, feeling O.K. 
 Got a little lost along the way 
 Just around the corner to the light of day 
 Just around the corner to the light of day, yeah

124,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Streets Of Philadelphia,"I was bruised and battered, I couldn't tell what I felt 
 I was unrecognizable to myself 
 Saw my reflection in a window and didn't know my own face 
 Oh, brother, are you gonna leave me wasting away 
 On the streets of Philadelphia? 
 I walked the avenue 'til my legs felt like stone 
 I heard voices of friends vanished and gone 
 At night I could hear the blood in my veins 
 Just as black and whispering as the rain 
 On the streets of Philadelphia 
 Ain't no angel gonna greet me 
 It's just you and I, my friend 
 And my clothes don't fit me no more 
 I walked a thousand miles just to slip this skin 
 The night has fallen and I'm lying awake 
 I can feel myself fading away 
 So receive me, brother, with your faithless kiss 
 Or will we leave each other alone like this 
 On the streets of Philadelphia?"
125,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Secret Garden,"She'll let you in her house 
 If you come knockin' late at night 
 She'll let you in her mouth 
 If the words you say are right 
 If you pay the price 
 She'll let you deep inside 
 But there's a secret garden she hides 
 She'll let you in her car 
 To go drivin' round 
 She'll let you into the parts of herself 
 That'll bring you down 
 She'll let you in her heart 
 If you got a hammer and a vise 
 But into her secret garden, don't think twice 
 You've gone a million miles 
 How far'd you get 
 To that place where you can't remember 
 And you can't forget 
 She'll lead you down the path 
 There'll be tenderness in the air 
 She'll let you come just far enough 
 So you know she's really there 
 Then she'll look at you and smile 
 And her eyes will say 
 She's got a secret garden 
 Where everything you want 
 Where everything you need 
 Will always stay 
 A million miles away"
126,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Murder Incorporated,"Bobby's got a gun that he keeps beneath his pillow (oh yeah) 
 Out on the street your chances are zero (oh yeah) 
 Take a look around you (come on down) 
 It ain't too complicated 
 You're messin' with Murder Incorporated 
 Now you check over your shoulder everywhere that you go (oh yeah) 
 Walkin' down the street, there's eyes in every shadow (oh yeah) 
 You better take a look around you (come on down) 
 That equipment you got's so outdated 
 You can't compete with Murder Incorporated 
 Everywhere you look now there's Murder Incorporated 
 So you keep a little secret down deep inside your dresser drawer 
 From dealing with the heat you're feelin' down on the killin' floor 
 No matter where you step you feel you're never out of danger 
 So the comfort that you keeps a gold-plated snub-nose thirty-two 
 I heard that you 
 You got a job downtown, man it leaves your head cold (oh yeah) 
 And everywhere you look life ain't got no soul (oh yeah) 
 That apartment you live in feels like it's just a place to hide 
 When your walkin' down the streets you won't meet no one eye to eye 
 Now the cops reported you as just another homicide 
 I can tell that you was just frustrated 
 From livin' with Murder Incorporated 
 Incorporated 
 Everywhere you look now 
 Murder Incorporated 
 Down on your knees 
 Murder Incorporated 
 Everywhere that you turn it's murder Incorporated"
127,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Blood Brothers,"We played king of the mountain out on the end 
 The world come chargin' up the hill, and we were women and men 
 Now there's so much that time, time and memory fade away 
 We got our own roads to ride and chances we gotta take 
 We stood side by side each one fightin' for the other 
 We said until we died we'd always be blood brothers 
 Now the hardness of this world slowly grinds your dreams away 
 Makin' a fool's joke out of the promises we make 
 And what once seemed black and white turns to so many shades of gray 
 We lose ourselves in work to do and bills to pay 
 And it's a ride, ride, ride, and there ain't much cover 
 With no one runnin' by your side my blood brother 
 On through the houses of the dead past those fallen in their tracks 
 Always movin' ahead and never lookin' back 
 Now I don't know how I feel, I don't know how I feel tonight 
 If I've fallen 'neath the wheel, if I've lost or I've gained sight 
 I don't even know why, I don't know why I made this call 
 Or if any of this matters anymore after all 
 But the stars are burnin' bright like some mystery uncovered 
 I'll keep movin' through the dark with you in my heart 
 My blood brother"
128,Bruce Springsteen,rock,This Hard Land,"Hey there mister can you tell me what happened to the seeds I've sown 
 Can you give me a reason sir as to why they've never grown 
 They've just blown around from town to town 
 Till they're back out on these fields 
 Where they fall from my hand 
 Back into the dirt of this hard land 
 Now me and my sister from Germantown we did ride 
 We made our bed sir from the rock on the mountainside 
 We been blowin' around from town to town 
 Lookin' for a place to stand 
 Where the sun burst through the cloud to fall like a circle 
 Like a circle of fire down on this hard land 
 Now even the rain it don't come 'round 
 It don't come 'round here no more 
 And the only sound at night's the wind 
 Slammin' the back porch door 
 It just stirs you up like it wants to blow you down 
 Twistin' and churnin' up the sand 
 Leavin' all them scarecrows lyin' face down 
 Face down in the dirt of this hard land 
 From a building up on the hill 
 I can hear a tape deck blastin' ""Home on the Range"" 
 I can see them Bar-M choppers sweepin' low across the plains 
 It's me and you Frank we're lookin' for lost cattle 
 Our hooves twistin' and churnin' up the sand 
 We're ridin' in the whirlwind searchin' for lost treasure 
 Way down south of the Rio Grande 
 We're ridin' cross that river in the moonlight 
 Up onto the banks of this hard land 
 Hey Frank won't ya pack your bags 
 And meet me tonight down at Liberty Hall 
 Just one kiss from you my brother and we'll ride until we fall 
 Well sleep in the fields, we'll sleep by the rivers 
 And in the morning we'll make a plan 
 We'll if you can't make it 
 Stay hard, stay hungry, stay alive 
 If you can 
 And meet me in a dream of this hard land"
129,Bruce Springsteen,rock,The Ghost Of Tom Joad,"Men walking along the railroad track 
 Going someplace and there's no going back 
 Highway patrol choppers coming up over the ridge 
 Hot soup on a campfire under the bridge 
 Shelter line stretching round the corner 
 Welcome to the new world order 
 Families sleeping in their cars in the Southwest 
 No home, no job, no peace, no rest 
 Well, the highway is alive tonight 
 But nobody's kidding nobody about where it goes 
 I'm sitting down here in the campfire light 
 Searching for the ghost of Tom Joad 
 He pulls a prayer book out of his sleeping bag 
 Preacher lights up a butt and he takes a drag 
 Waiting for when the last shall be first, and the first shall be last 
 In a cardboard box neath the underpass 
 Got a one-way ticket to the promised land 
 You got a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand 
 Sleeping on a pillow of solid rock 
 Bathing in the city aqueduct 
 Well, the highway is alive tonight 
 Where it's headed everybody knows 
 I'm sitting down here in the campfire light 
 Waiting on the ghost of Tom Joad 
 Now Tom said, ""Mom, wherever there's a cop beating a guy 
 Wherever a hungry newborn baby cries 
 Where there's a fight against the blood and hatred in the air 
 Look for me, Mom, I'll be there 
 ""Wherever there's somebody fighting for a place to stand 
 Or a decent job or a helping hand 
 Wherever somebody's struggling to be free 
 Look in their eyes, Mom, you'll see me"" 
 The highway is alive tonight 
 But nobody's kidding nobody about where it goes 
 I'm sitting down here in the campfire light 
 With the ghost of old Tom Joad"
130,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Straight Time,"Got out of prison back in '86 and I found a wife 
 Walked the clean and narrow 
 Just tryin' to stay out and stay alive 
 Got a job at the rendering plant, it ain't gonna make me rich 
 In the darkness before dinner comes 
 Sometimes I can feel the itch 
 I got a cold mind to go tripping 'cross that thin line 
 I'm sick of doin' straight time 
 My uncle's at the evenin' table, makes his living runnin' hot cars 
 Slips me a hundred dollar bill says 
 ""Charlie you best remember who your friends are"" 
 Got a cold mind to go tripping 'cross that thin line 
 I ain't makin' straight time 
 Eight years in it feels like you're gonna die 
 But you get used to anything 
 Sooner or later it just becomes your life 
 Kitchen floor in the evening tossin' my little babies high 
 Mary's smiling but she's watching me out of the corner of her eye 
 Seems you can't get any more than half free 
 I step out onto the front porch and suck the cold air deep inside of me 
 Got a cold mind to go tripping 'cross that thin line 
 I'm sick of doin' straight time 
 In the basement huntin' gun and a hacksaw 
 Sip a beer and thirteen inches of barrel drop to the floor 
 Come home in the evening, can't get the smell from my hands 
 Lay my head down on the pillow 
 And go driftin' off into the foreign lands"
131,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Highway 29,"I slipped on her shoe, she was a perfect size seven 
 I said ""There's no smokin' in the store ma'am."" 
 She crossed her legs and then 
 We made some small talk that's where it should have stopped 
 She slipped me her number, I put it in my pocket 
 My hand slipped up her skirt, everything slipped my mind 
 In that little roadhouse 
 On Highway 29 
 It was a small town bank it was a mess 
 Well I had a gun you know the rest 
 Money on the floorboards, shirt was covered in blood 
 And she was cryin', her and me we headed south 
 On Highway 29 
 In a little desert motel the air was hot and clean 
 I slept the sleep of the dead, I didn't dream 
 I woke in the morning, washed my face in the sink 
 We headed into the Sierra Madres 'cross the border line 
 The winter sun shot through the black trees 
 I told myself it was all something in her 
 But as we drove I knew it was something in me 
 Something that'd been comin' for a long long time 
 And something that was here with me now 
 On Highway 29 
 The road was filled with broken glass and gasoline 
 She wasn't sayin' nothin', it was just a dream 
 The wind come silent through the windshield 
 All I could see was snow, sky and pines 
 I closed my eyes and I was runnin' 
 I was runnin' then I was flyin'"
132,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Youngstown,"Here in northeast Ohio 
 Back in eighteen-o-three 
 James and Danny Heaton 
 Found the ore that was linin' Yellow Creek 
 They built a blast furnace 
 Here along the shore 
 And they made the cannonballs 
 That helped the Union win the war 
 Here in Youngstown 
 Here in Youngstown 
 My sweet Jenny I'm sinkin' down 
 Here darlin' in Youngstown 
 Well my daddy worked the furnaces 
 Kept 'em hotter than hell 
 I come home from 'Nam worked my way to scarfer 
 A job that'd suit the devil as well 
 Taconite coke and limestone 
 Fed my children and make my pay 
 Them smokestacks reachin' like the arms of God 
 Into a beautiful sky of soot and clay 
 Here in Youngstown 
 Here in Youngstown 
 Sweet Jenny I'm sinkin' down 
 Here darlin' in Youngstown 
 Well my daddy come on the Ohio works 
 When he come home from World War Two 
 Now the yard's just scrap and rubble 
 He said ""Them big boys did what Hitler couldn't do."" 
 These mills they built the tanks and bombs 
 That won this country's wars 
 We sent our sons to Korea and Vietnam 
 Now we're wondering what they were dyin' for 
 Here in Youngstown 
 Here in Youngstown 
 My sweet Jenny I'm sinkin' down 
 Here darlin' in Youngstown 
 From the Monongahela valley 
 To the Mesabi iron range 
 To the coal mines of Appalachia 
 The story's always the same 
 Seven hundred tons of metal a day 
 Now sir you tell me the world's changed 
 Once I made you rich enough 
 Rich enough to forget my name 
 And Youngstown 
 And Youngstown 
 My sweet Jenny I'm sinkin' down 
 Here darlin' in Youngstown 
 When I die I don't want no part of heaven 
 I would not do heaven's work well 
 I pray the devil comes and takes me 
 To stand in the fiery furnaces of hell"
133,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Sinaloa Cowboys,"Miguel came from a small town in northern Mexico 
 He came north with his brother Louis to California three years ago 
 They crossed at the river levee when Louis was just sixteen 
 And found work together in the fields of the San Joaquin 
 They left their homes and family 
 Their father said ""My sons one thing you will learn. 
 For everything the north gives it exacts a price in return."" 
 They worked side by side in the orchards 
 From morning till the day was through 
 Doing the work the hueros wouldn't do 
 Word was out some men in from Sinaloa were looking for some hands 
 Well deep in Fresno county there was a deserted chicken ranch 
 There in a small tin shack on the edge of a ravine 
 Miguel and Louis stood cooking methamphetamine 
 You could spend a year in the orchards 
 Or make half as much in one ten-hour shift 
 Working for the men from Sinaloa 
 But if you slipped the hydriodic acid 
 Could burn right through your skin 
 They'd leave you spittin' up blood in the desert 
 If you breathed those fumes in 
 It was early one winter evening as Miguel stood watch outside 
 When the shack exploded lighting up the valley night 
 Miguel carried Louis' body over his shoulder down a swale 
 To the creekside and there in the tall grass Louis Rosales died 
 Miguel lifted Louis' body into his truck and then he drove 
 To where the morning sunlight fell on a eucalyptus grove 
 There in the dirt he dug up ten thousand dollars all that they'd saved 
 Kissed his brothers lips and placed him in his grave"
134,Bruce Springsteen,rock,The Line,"I got my discharge from Fort Irwin 
 Took place on the San Diego county line 
 Felt funny bein' a civilian again 
 It'd been some time 
 My wife had died a year ago 
 I was still tryin' to find my way back whole 
 Went to work for the INS on the line 
 With the California border patrol 
 Bobby Ramirez was a ten-year veteran 
 We became friends 
 His family was from Guanajuato 
 So the job it was different for him 
 He said ""They risk death in the deserts and mountains 
 Pay all they got to the smugglers rings 
 We send 'em home and they come right back again 
 Carl hunger is a powerful thing"" 
 Well I was good at doin' what I was told 
 Kept my uniform pressed and clean 
 At night I chased their shadows 
 Through the arroyos and ravines 
 Drug runners farmers with their families 
 Young women with little children by their sides 
 Come night we'd wait out in the canyons 
 And try to keep 'em from crossin' the line 
 Well the first time I saw her 
 She was in the holdin' pen 
 Our eyes met and she looked away 
 Then she looked back again 
 Her hair was black as coal 
 Her eyes reminded me of what I'd lost 
 She had a young child cryin' in her arms 
 I asked ""Señora is there anything I can do?"" 
 There's a bar in Tijuana 
 Where me and Bobby drink alongside 
 The same people we'd sent back the day before 
 She said her name was Louisa 
 She was from Sonora and had just come north 
 We danced and I held her in my arms 
 And I knew what I would do 
 She said she had some family in Madera county 
 If she, her child and younger brother could just get through 
 At night they come across the levee 
 In the searchlight's dusty glow 
 We'd rush 'em in our Broncos 
 Force 'em back down into the river below 
 She climbed into my truck 
 She leaned toward me and we kissed 
 As we drove her brother's shirt slipped open 
 And I saw the tape across his chest 
 We were just about on the highway 
 When Bobby's jeep come up in the dust on my right 
 I pulled over and let my engine run 
 And I stepped out into his lights 
 I felt myself movin' 
 My gun restin' 'neath my hand 
 We stood there starin' at each other 
 As off through the arroyo she ran 
 Bobby Ramirez he never said nothin' 
 Six months later I left the line 
 I drifted to the central valley 
 And I took what work that I could find 
 At night I searched the local bars 
 And the migrant towns 
 Lookin' for my Louisa 
 With the back hair fallin' down"
135,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Balboa Park,"He lay his blanket underneath the freeway 
 As the evening sky grew dark 
 Took a sniff of toncho from his coke can 
 And headed through Balboa Park 
 Where the men in their Mercedes 
 Come nightly to employ 
 In the cool San Diego evening 
 The services of the border boys 
 He grew up near the Zona Norte 
 With the hustlers and smugglers he hung out with 
 He swallowed their balloons of cocaine 
 Brought 'em across the Twelfth Street strip 
 Sleeping in a shelter 
 If the night got too cold 
 Runnin' from the migra 
 Of the border patrol 
 Past the salvage yard 'cross the train tracks 
 And in through the storm drain 
 They stretched their blankets out 'neath the freeway 
 And each one took a name 
 There was X-man and Cochise 
 Little Spider his sneakers covered in river mud 
 They come north to California 
 End up with the poison in their blood 
 He did what he had to do for the money 
 Sometimes he sent home what he could spare 
 The rest went to high-top sneakers and toncho 
 And jeans like the gavachos wear 
 One night the border patrol swept Twelfth Street 
 A big car come fast down the boulevard 
 Spider stood caught in its headlights 
 Got hit and went down hard 
 As the car sped away Spider held his stomach 
 Limped to his blanket 'neath the underpass 
 Lie there tasting his own blood on his tongue 
 Closed his eyes and listened to the cars 
 Rushin' by so fast"
136,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Dry Lightning,"Dry Lightning 
 I threw my robe on in the morning 
 Watched the ring on the stove turn red 
 Stared hypnotized into a cup of coffee 
 Pulled on my boots and made the bed 
 Screen door hangin' off it's hinges 
 Kept bangin' me awake all night 
 As I look out the window 
 The only thing in site 
 Is dry lightning on the horizon line 
 Just dry lightning and and you on my mind 
 I chased the heat of her blood 
 Like it was the holy grail 
 Descend beautiful spirit 
 Into the evening pale 
 Her appaloosa's 
 Kickin' in the corral smelling rain 
 There's a low thunder rolling'cross the mesquite plain 
 But there's just dry lightning on the horizon line 
 It's just dry lightning and and you on my mind 
 I'd drive down to alvarado street 
 Where she'd dance to make ends meet 
 I'd spend the night over my gin 
 As she'd talk to her men 
 Well the piss yellow sun 
 Comes bringin' up the day 
 She said 'ain't nobody can give nobody 
 What they really need anyway.' 
 Well you get so sick of the fightin' 
 You lose your fear of the end 
 But I can't lose your memory 
 And the sweet smell of your skin 
 And it's just dry lightning on the horizonline 
 Just dry lightning and and you on my mind"
137,Bruce Springsteen,rock,The New Timer,"He rode the rails since the great depression 
 Fifty years out on the skids 
 He said you don't cross nobody 
 You'll be all right out here kid 
 Left my family in Pennsylvania 
 Searchin' for work I hit the road 
 I met Frank in east Texas 
 In a freight yard blown through with snow 
 From New Mexico to Colorado 
 California to the sea 
 Frank he showed me the ropes, sir 
 Just till I could get back on my feet 
 I hoed sugar beets outside of Firebaugh 
 I picked the peaches from the Marysville tree 
 They bunked us in a barn just like animals 
 Me and a hundred others just like me 
 We split up come the springtime 
 I never seen Frank again 
 'Cept one rainy night he blew by me on grainer 
 Shouted my name and disappeared in the rain and the wind 
 They found him shot dead outside Stockton 
 His body lyin' on a muddy hill 
 Nothin' taken, nothin' stolen 
 Somebody killed him just to kill 
 Late that summer I was rollin' through the plains of Texas 
 A vision passed before my eyes A small house sittin' trackside 
 With the glow of the saviours beautiful light 
 A woman stood cookin' in the kitchen 
 Kid sat at the table with his old man 
 Now I wonder does my son miss me 
 Does he wonder where I am 
 Tonight I pick my campsite carefully 
 Outside the Sacramento Yard 
 Gather some wood and light a fire 
 In the early winter dark 
 Wind whistling cold I pull my coat around me 
 Make some coffee and stare out into the black night 
 I lie awake, I lie awake sir 
 With my machete by my side 
 My Jesus your gracious love and mercy 
 Tonight I'm sorry could not fill my heart 
 Like one good rifle And the name of who I ought to kill"
138,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Across The Border,"Tonight my bag is packed 
 Tomorrow I'll walk these tracks 
 That will lead me across the border 
 Tomorrow my love and I will sleep 'neath auburn skies 
 Somewhere across the border 
 We'll leave behind my dear 
 The pain and sadness we found here 
 And we'll drink from the bravo's muddy water 
 Where the sky grows grey and wide 
 We'll meet on the other side 
 There across the border 
 For you I'll build a house 
 High upon a grassy hill 
 Somewhere across the border 
 Where pain and memory 
 Pain and memory have been stilled 
 There across the border 
 And sweet blossoms fill the air 
 Pastures of gold and green 
 Roll down into cool clear waters 
 And in your arms 'neath open skies 
 I'll kiss the sorrow from your eyes 
 There across the border 
 Tonight we'll sing the songs 
 I'll dream of you my coraz n 
 And tomorrow my heart will be strong 
 And may the saints' blessing and grace 
 Carry me safely into your arms 
 There across the border 
 For what are we 
 Without hope in our hearts 
 That someday we'll drink from god's blessed waters 
 And eat the fruit from the vine 
 I know love and fortune will be mine 
 Somewhere across the border"

 In the mountains and deltas 
 Of vietnamin '75 saigon fell and he left his command 
 And brought his family to the promised land 
 Seabrook, Texas and the small towns in the gulf of Mexico 
 It was delta country and reminded him of home 
 He worked as a machinist, put his money away 
 And bought a shrimp boat with his cousin 
 And together they harvested galveston bay 
 In the mornin' 'fore the sun come up 
 He'd kiss his sleepin' daughter 
 Steer out through thechannel 
 And cast his nets into the water 
 Billy sutter fought with charlie company 
 In the highlands of quang tri 
 He was wounded in the battle of chu lai 
 Shipped home in '68 
 There he married and worked the gulf fishing grounds 
 In a boat that'd been his father's 
 In the morning he'd kiss his sleeping son 
 And cast his nets into the water 
 Billy sat in front of his TV as the south fell 
 And the communists rolled into saigon 
 He and his friends watched as the refugees came 
 Settled on the same streets and worked the coast they'd grew up on 
 Soon in the bars around the harbor was talk 
 Of America for the americans 
 Someone said 'you want 'em out, you got to burn 'em out.' 
 And brought in the Texas klan 
 One humid Texas night there were 3 shadows on the harbor 
 Come to burn the vietnamese into the sea 
 In the fire's light shots rang out 
 2 texans lay dead on the ground 
 Le stood with a pistol in his hand 
 A jury acquitted him in self-defense 
 As before the judge he did stand 
 But as le walked down the courthouse steps 
 Billy said 'my friend you're a dead man.' 
 One late summer night le stood watch along the waterside 
 Billy stood in the shadows 
 His k-bar knife in his hand 
 And the moon slipped behind the clouds 
 Le lit a cigarette, the bay was still as glass 
 As he walked by billy stuck his knife into his pocket 
 Took a breath and let him pass 
 In the early darkness billy rose up 
 Went into the kitchen for a drink of water 
 Kissed his sleeping wife 
 Headed into the channel 
 And cast his nets into the water 
 Of Galveston Bay"
140,Bruce Springsteen,rock,My Best Was Never Good Enough,"Every cloud has a silver lining, every dog has his day 
 She said now don't say nothing 
 If you don't have something nice to say 
 The tough now they get going when the going gets tough 
 But for you my best was never good enough 
 Now don't try for a home run baby 
 If you can get the job done with a hit 
 Remember a quitter never wins 
 And a winner never quits 
 The sun don't shine on a sleepin' dogs ass 
 And all the rest of that stuff 
 But for you my best was never good enough 
 If God gives you nothin' but lemons then you make some lemonade 
 The early bird catches the fuckin' worm 
 Rome wasn't built in a day 
 Now life's like a box of chocolatesyou never know what you're going to get 
 Stupid is as stupid does and the rest of that shit 
 Come on pretty baby call my bluff 
 'Cause for you my best was never good enough"

 The Mohawks, the Mohawks, they're still out there in the woods 
 Monatuk, Ocanuk, runnin' through my dreams now 
 With fire on their fingertips and Indian screams 
 With fire on their fingertips and feathers made of moonbeams 
 Well early in the morning the cannoneer cried 
 ""I seen the sailor's warning in the western sky"" 
 Well mountain man, if you can, cut me down a fir tree 
 Branches full of candlesticks for baby and me

144,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Santa Ana,"From the tin rooftop the little boy did watch 
 The procession down through town 
 Through the museum where Daniel whupped the Devil 
 With them boys from the underground 
 Where the Giants of Science fight for tight control 
 Over the wildlands of New Mexico 
 Sam Houston's ghost's in Texas fighting for his soul 
 And the townsfolk rest uneasy beneath the guns of Kid Cole 
 And the kid says: ""Hey, where's Santa Ana 
 He who could romance the dumb into talking 
 Take a chance with me tonight, my contessa, 
 If it don't work out I ain't lame, I can walk"" 
 Now some folks think cancer's taken to the streets of this town 
 But Sandy eats her candy and then lays her money down 
 Them cats are in from the canyons to strut their stuff in town 
 But there's only secret sinners here 
 Lord, there's only secret thieves 
 Only a fool would try to save 
 What the desert chose to leave 
 And hey there senorita, 
 With your playboys in their Spanish bandanas 
 French cream won't soften those boots, baby 
 French kisses will not break your heart 
 Oh painted night set free with light 
 Glows outside the Rainbow Saloon 
 Matching braces with a Spanish lady 
 'Neath a graduation moon 
 No more colleges, no more coronations 
 Some punk's idea of a teenage nation 
 Has forced Santa Ana to change his station 
 From soldier to cartoon 
 And the Giants of Science spend their days and nights 
 Not with wives, not with lovers, but searchin' for the lights 
 They spotted in the desert on their helicopter flights 
 Just to be lost in the dust and the night 
 Hey my Contessa, in your juke joint rags you always bring candy for the kids 
 Come waltz with me tonight senorita"

 And your papa's gonna beat you 'cause he knows you're out on the run 
 I'm gonna live a life of love and tonight you're the one 
 The highway is alive tonight so baby do not be frightened 
 There's something about a pretty girl on a sweet summer night 
 That gets this boy excited 
 The radio man finally understands and plays you something you can move to 
 You lay back, cut loose your drive power 
 Your girl leans over and says, ""Daddy, can you turn that radio up any louder?"" 
 The juke joint's hummin', everybody came down 
 Little Willie and his Soul Brooms laying all this stuff now 
 Well don't let that daylight steal your soul 
 Get in your wheels and roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll 
 Oh that's all right now 
 Oh go on, go on, go on

 Now the Pythons are down from old Englishtown 
 And they're looking to do some livin' 
 Well the leader of the Pythons 
 Is a kid they just call Zero 
 Now Terry's pop says these kids are some kind of monsters 
 But Terry says ""No, pop, they're just plain heroes"" 
 Zero and Terry they found a love that burnes like wildfire 
 Now Terry's daddy understood that this Zero was no good 
 A child, a thief and a liar 
 Well from out of the darkness that breaks the dawn 
 Zero rode like twilight 
 He said ""Tonight's the night, Blind Terry, come on"" 
 Terry come on, tonight is the night 
 Pack your bags, baby 
 And together they ran like reindeers through the street 
 Like tomorrow the earth was gonna catch on fire 
 Now Terry's dad hired some troopers to kill Zero and bring Terry back home 
 They crawled up in the night 
 Like firelight 
 Now snow-white troopers from the council of crime 
 Rode silver foxes through Terry's field 
 Oh they met the Pythons down on Route 9 but they refused to yield 
 The Pythons fought with buzz guns 
 And the troopers with swords like light 
 And Zero and Terry they ran away 
 And the gang fought all through the night 
 Well now some folks say Zero and Terry got away 
 Other said they were caught and brought back 
 But still young pilgrims to this day 
 Go to that spot way down by the railroad track 
 Where the Troopers met the Pythons 
 Old timers cry on a hot August night 
 If you look hard enough, if you try 
 You'll catch Zero and Terry and all the Pythons 
 Oh just hiking them streets of the sky 
 Just walkin', hiking the streets of the sky 
 Just hiking the streets of the sky 
 Hey Zero"

 Scraping tears up off the street 
 Standin' guard beneath the window 
 Where only Linda sleeps 
 The leader is a kid named Eddie 
 Walkin' like an angel in defeat 
 He trashes her old man's car, slashes Linda's name in the street 
 And calls out 
 Linda will you let me be the one 
 Linda will you let me be the one 
 Linda will you let me be the one 
 Linda will you let me be the one 
 In a room full of contenders 
 Eddy spars till he drops to his bed and surrenders 
 Draped in the scarves 
 He stole from Linda's bedroom 
 The night he laid at her feet 
 When the midnight boys were stranded 
 Down on Cason Street 
 Linda will you let me be the one 
 Linda will you let me be the one 
 Linda will you let me be the one 
 Linda will you let me be the one 
 In the basement of St Mary's 
 Eddy hides from the rain 
 In with the stolen sisters till the streets are dry again 
 Talkin' fast cars and spare parts 
 Empty homes and hearts

 This time she'll tell me how she really feels 
 Bring me down to her lightning shack 
 You can watch my partner reeling 
 She moves up, she moves back 
 Out on the floor there just is no one cleaner 
 She does this thing she calls the ""Jump Back Jack"" 
 She's got the heart of a ballerina 
 She's straight from the Bronx 
 Hung off the line 
 She slips, she slides, she slops, she bops, she bumps, she grinds 
 Even them dance hall hacks 
 From the west side of the tracks 
 Move in close to catch her timing 
 She moves up, she moves back 
 Out on the floor there just is no one cleaner 
 She does this thing she calls the ""Jump Back Jack"" 
 She's got the heart of a ballerina 
 Well, she ain't no little girl 
 She ain't got no curls 
 Her hair ain't brown and her eyes ain't either 
 Round and round and round and round and 
 Round and round and round and round and 
 Round and round and round and round and 
 Round and round and round and round and 
 My heart's wood, she's a carpenter 
 She's an angel in the night, what she does is alright

 Dance with me, partner 
 Dance with me, partner 'til the dawn

 I had a dream tonight my dream comes true 
 And if you'll hold me tight 
 We'll be riders, girl, on the night 
 Ooh, I want a rendezvous 
 Haven't I told you, girl, how much I like you 
 I got a feeling that you like me too 
 Well if you hold me tight 
 We'll be riders, girl, on the night 
 Ooh, I want a rendezvous 
 You deserve so much more than this, girl 
 Well I'm riding on the power and livin' on the promise in your last kiss 
 Because I had a dream our love would last forever

150,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Give The Girl A Kiss,"I ain't lookin' for just excitement 
 Baby that's just a fact 
 If you want to get to her heart 
 You better let her know just where you're at 
 It ain't written in the sky above 
 No fortune-teller told me this 
 You gotta tell her that you love her 
 Tell her that you need her 
 And give the girl a great big kiss 
 Give the girl a great big kiss 
 Now if you're such a fool you think 
 It don't matter, baby, what you say 
 Maybe you better tell her how you're feelin' 
 It ain't gonna happen any other way 
 It ain't written in the sky above 
 No fortune-teller told me this 
 You gotta tell her that you love her 
 Tell her that you need her 
 And give the girl a great big kiss 
 Give the girl a great big kiss 
 Now baby all I wanna do 
 Is darlin' make sweet love to you 
 Now I don't know what the meanin' is 
 Why you wanna hide the things you feel and say 
 But baby it's just a natural fact 
 Love was never meant to be that way 
 It ain't written in the sky above 
 No fortune-teller told me this 
 You gotta tell her that you love her 
 Tell her that you need her 
 And give the girl a great big kiss 
 Give the girl a great big kiss 
 Now baby all I wanna do"
151,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Iceman,"Sleepy town ain't got the guts to budge 
 Baby, this emptiness has already been judged 
 I wanna go out tonight, I wanna find out what I got 
 You're a strange part of me, you're a preacher's girl 
 And I don't want no piece of this mechanical world 
 Got my arms open wide and my blood is running hot 
 We'll take the midnight road right to the devil's door 
 And even the white angels of Eden with their flamin' swords 
 Won't be able to stop us from hitting town in this dirty old Ford 
 Well it don't take no nerve when you got nothing to guard 
 I got tombstones in my eyes and I'm running real hard 
 My baby was a lover and the world just blew her away 
 Once they tried to steal my heart, beat it right outta my head 
 But baby they didn't know that I was born dead 
 I am the iceman, fighting for the right to live 
 I say better than the glory roads of heaven better off riding 
 Hellbound in the dirt, better than the bright lines of the freeway 
 Better than the shadows of your daddy's church"
152,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Bring On The Night,"I lie in bed but baby I can't sleep no matter how hard I try 
 There's something bad, baby, wrong with me whenever I close my eyes 
 The dreams of Mary keep me awake with every little curve in place 
 When I walk home in the daybreak I pray come back home, baby, won't you give me 
 Darlin' bring on the night, oh yeah darlin', bring on the night 
 Oh now darlin', bring on the night 
 I walk the street, I'm lookin' for romance 
 I end up stumblin' in some stupid half-trance 
 As I watch the lovers mix with circumstance 
 We watch the disco dancers dance 
 I look for connection in some new eyes 
 But for protection they're tranquilized 
 Forbidding close inspection of who's tellin' who 
 Forbidding close inspection of who's tellin' who lies 
 Bring on the night, oh yeah darlin', bring on the night 
 Oh now darlin', bring on the night 
 Is it as simple as it seems 
 I don't know what I'm doin' here, is it as simple as it seems 
 Is it as simple as I fear, well if I'm right... 
 I look for connection in some new eyes 
 But for protection they're tranquilized 
 Forbidding close inspection of who's tellin' who 
 Forbidding close inspection of who's tellin' who 
 Baby of who's tellin' who lies 
 Bring on the night, oh yeah darlin', bring on the night 
 Oh now darlin', bring on the night, oh now darlin', bring on the night 
 Come on darlin', bring on the night"

 Everybody's reelin' when the bands hits the ceilin' 
 Don't you know you wanna go 
 The kids start rockin' when the boys start knockin' 
 And everybody wants to go 
 Let's go! 
 Joint's shut down but you don't wanna go home 
 You're in the shady side of town and you're all alone 
 Papa's chewin' your ear off, you ain't got no cash 
 Mama's chewin' your ear off 'bout hangin'out 
 With thrash 
 So fine, sent from above 
 So young and in love 
 So young and in love

154,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Hearts Of Stone,"You stare in the mirror at the lines in your face 
 And you try to see, girl 
 The way things were when we were at your place 
 In the days it was just you and me, girl 
 And you cry because things ain't like before 
 Well don't you know they can't be that way anymore 
 But don't worry baby 
 I can't talk now, I'm not alone 
 So put your ear close to the phone 
 'Cause this is the last dance 
 This is the last chance for hearts of stone 
 If there was something, baby, that I could do 
 Something that would last, honey, I would 
 But we all know, girl, especially you do 
 How you can't return to your past, no 
 So girl close your eyes and I'll be there 
 Hold me once more and we can go anywhere 
 Ah, we could 
 I can't talk now, I'm not alone 
 So put your ear close to the phone

155,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Don't Look Back,"Cold rain running down the front of my shirt 
 I'm flat on my back wheels in the dirt 
 Angel makes her face up out on Baker Street 
 She's straddling the shifter in my front seat 
 There's nothing to lose, it's a heartbreak 
 The deck's stacked 
 So put your foot to the floor and darling don't look back 
 We're making night tracks through the blazing rain 
 Blowin' pistons, workin' the fast lane 
 Red line burnin', pocket's full of cash 
 Angel writes her name in lipstick on my dash 
 There's nothing to lose 
 It's a bad break but baby we're backed 
 Tonight we'll blow off the doors and honey we won't look back 
 We held it in our hearts in the pourin' rain 
 We made it through the heart of a hurricane 
 We tore it apart and put it together again 
 Well angel, won't you believe in love for me 
 C'mon and meet me tonight, darling, out in the street 
 We'll move with the city in the dark 
 You got to walk, it talk, it in your heart 
 There's nothin' to lose it's a heartache 
 The deck's stacked 
 So put your foot to the floor, darling 
 Tonight we'll blow off the doors, baby 
 We're gonna even the score"
156,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Restless Nights,"Once we ran and lived as one 
 In another world, my little one 
 Where whispering trees and dark rivers run 
 I told a dream to you 
 Now outside the streets are gray 
 And the childhood games we played 
 Have faded away 
 My baby, she has restless nights 
 (She has restless nights) 
 My baby, she has restless nights 
 On late-night movie screens 
 Young lovers look so sure 
 Lost in wide-wake dreams 
 That they can't afford 
 Once I held you in my arms 
 On a bed of stone 
 Now we have grown 
 My baby, she has restless nights 
 (She has restless nights) 
 My baby, she has restless nights 
 Once we ran and lived as one 
 In different world, my little one 
 Where whispering trees and dark rivers run 
 I told a dream to you 
 Now I pray, darling, for the night 
 We'll dance down these darkened halls 
 Once again to fall 
 Into a dream"
157,Bruce Springsteen,rock,A Good Man Is Hard To Find (Pittsburgh),"It's cloudy out in Pittsburgh 
 It's raining in Saigon 
 Snow's fallin' all across the Michigan line 
 Well she sits by the lights of the Christmas tree 
 With the radio softly on 
 Thinkin' how a good man is so hard to find 
 Well once she had a fella 
 Once she was somebody's girl 
 And she gave all she had that one last time 
 Now there's a little girl asleep in the back room 
 She's gonna have to tell about the meanness in this world 
 And how a good man is so hard to find 
 Well there's pictures on the table by her bed 
 Him in his dress greens and her in her wedding white 
 She remembers how the world was the day he left 
 And now how that world is dead 
 And a good man is so hard to find 
 She got time now for Casanovas 
 Yeah those days are gone 
 She don't want that anymore, she's made up her mind 
 Just somebody told her 
 As the nights get on 
 When a good man is so hard to find 
 Well she shuts off the TV 
 And without a word 
 Into bed she climbs 
 Well she thinks how it was all so wasted 
 And how expendable their dreams all were 
 When a good man was so hard to find"
158,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Roulette,"We left the toys out in the yard 
 I took my wife and kids and left my home unguarded 
 We packed what we could into the car 
 No one here knows how it started 
 Suddenly everything was just so out of control 
 Now I want some answers, mister, I need to know 
 I hear all the talk but I don't know what you're sayin' 
 But I think I got a good idea of the game that you're playin' 
 Roulette, that's the name 
 Roulette, that's the game now 
 Roulette, I don't know what they're sayin' 
 Roulette, everybody's playin' 
 I grew up here on this street 
 Where nothin' moves, just a strange breeze 
 In a town full of worthless memories 
 There's a shadow in my backyard 
 I've got a house full of things that I can't touch 
 Well all those things won't do me much good now 
 I was a fireman out at Riker's, I did my job 
 Mister, I've been cheated, I feel like I've been robbed 
 I'm the big expendable, my life's just canceled null and void 
 Well what you gonna do about your new boy 
 Roulette, you're playin' with my life 
 Roulette, with my kids and my wife 
 Roulette, every day the stakes get bigger 
 Roulette, a different finger on the trigger 
 Down by the river that talks 
 The night speaks in searchlights 
 And shortwave radios squawk 
 The police patrol the streets 
 But I've left behind the man I used to be 
 Everything he believed and all that belonged to me 
 I tried to find my way out to somewhere where I thought it'd be safe 
 They stopped me at the roadblock they put up on the interstate 
 They put me in detention but I broke loose and then I ran 
 They said they want to ask me a few questions but I think they had other plans 
 Now I don't know who to trust and I don't know what I can believe 
 They say they want to help me but with the stuff they keep on sayin' 
 I think those guys just wanna keep on playin' 
 Roulette, with my life 
 Roulette, with my kids and my wife 
 Roulette, the bullet's in the chamber 
 Roulette, who's the unlucky stranger 
 Roulette, surprise, you're dead 
 Roulette, the gun's to your head 
 Roulette, the bullet's spinning in the chamber 
 Roulette, pull the trigger, feel the click 
 No further danger"
159,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Dollhouse,"Well ever since you were a little girl 
 You set the rules in your little world 
 But girls grow up and throw their toys away 
 You're a big girl now but you still wanna play 
 (Girl we're living) 
 You dress them up the way you want to 
 (Girl we're living) 
 You make them do just what you want them to 
 (Girl we're living) 
 Once I thought we had a love that was true 
 But I'm just another doll in your dollhouse to you 
 We're living in a dollhouse 
 We're living in a dollhouse 
 Girl we're living in a dollhouse 
 You may feel safe and sound 
 But your dollhouse, girl, is falling down 
 It's all been neatly arranged in your mind 
 Every detail fits your own design 
 Every room is perfectly in place 
 But I can see the sadness, baby, on your face 
 You had a plan and darling like a child 
 You thought it's down to fashion, down to style 
 But your little dreamhouse is runnin' wild 
 Before your very eyes we're shrinking down to size 
 We're living in a dollhouse 
 We're living in a dollhouse 
 Girl we're living in a dollhouse 
 You may feel safe and sound 
 But your dollhouse, girl, is falling down 
 Everything's as you dreamed it would be 
 But there's something wrong that you can't see 
 Room by room you keep looking for some little flaw 
 A crack somewhere in your dollhouse wall 
 Something, girl, that will explain away 
 The hurt you feel, darling, when we play 
 Your little dolls they got grip on you 
 Until you're just another doll in your dollhouse too 
 We're living in a dollhouse 
 Girl, we're living in a dollhouse 
 Oh we're living in a dollhouse 
 We may feel safe and sound 
 But our dollhouse, girl, is falling down 
 Oh we're living in a dollhouse 
 Girl, we're living in a dollhouse"

 Ringin' out down Union Street 
 I hear the lead singer shoutin' out girl 
 I wanna be a slave to the beat 
 Yeah tonight I wanna break my chains 
 Somebody break my heart 
 Somebody shake my brains 
 Downtown there's something that I wanna hear 
 There's a sound little girl keeps ringin' in my ear 
 I wanna be where the bands are 
 I wanna be where the bands are 
 Where the bands are 
 I wanna be where the bands are 
 I get off from work and I grab something to eat 
 I turn the corner and I drive down your street 
 Little gray houses, darling, looks like nowhere 
 But hey I know you're hidin' in there 
 Come on out for just a little while 
 You know that heart of stone girl it just ain't your style 
 Tonight I wanna feel the beat of the crowd 
 And when I tell you that I love you 
 I wanna have to shout it out loud 
 Shout it out loud 
 I wanna be where the bands are 
 I wanna be where the bands are 
 Where the bands are 
 I wanna be where the bands are 
 I hear the guitars ringin' out again 
 Ringin' on down Union Street 
 I hear the lead singer shoutin' out and girl 
 I wanna be a slave to the beat 
 And I want something that'll break my chains 
 Something to break my heart 
 Something to break my chains 
 There's a rocker's special on tonight 
 So meet me on down 
 'Neath the neon lights 
 I wanna be where the bands are 
 I wanna be where the bands are 
 Where the bands are 
 I wanna be where the bands are"
161,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Loose Ends,"We met out on open streets when we had no place to go 
 I remember how my heart beat when you said I love you so 
 Then little by little we choked out all the life that our love could hold 
 Oh no 
 It's like we had a noose and baby without check 
 We pulled until it grew tighter around our necks 
 Each one waiting for the other, darlin', to say when 
 Well baby you can meet me tonight on the loose end 
 We didn't count tomorrows, we took what we could and baby we ran 
 There was no time for sorrow, every place we went I held your hand 
 And when the night closed in I was sure your kisses told me all I had to know 
 But oh no 
 It's like we had a noose and baby without check 
 We pulled until it grew tighter around our necks 
 Each one waiting for the other, darlin', to say when 
 Well baby you can meet me tonight on the loose end 
 Our love has fallen around us like we said it never could 
 We saw it happen to all the others but to us it never would 
 Well how could something so bad, darling, come from something that was so good 
 I don't know"
162,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Living On The Edge Of The World,"Early North Jersey industrial skyline 
 I'm an all-set cobra jet creepin' through the night time 
 Gotta find a gas station, gotta find a pay phone 
 This turnpike sure is spooky at night when you're all alone 
 I'm living on the edge of the world 
 Tryin' to get my girl on the line 
 Livin' on the edge of the world 
 But I think it's just a waste of my time 
 Some jerk keeps breaking my connection, girl 
 'Cause I'm living on the edge of the world 
 Living on the edge of the world 
 Radio, radio, hear my tale of heartbreak 
 New Jersey in the morning like a lunar landscape 
 Got a counter girl at the Exit 24 HoJo 
 Down past the refinery towers where the great black river flows 
 I'm living on the edge of the world 
 Tryin' to get back to you, girl 
 I'm living on the edge of the world 
 Tryin' to get a message through 
 I gotta make a connection, girl 
 Because I'm living on the edge of the world 
 Living on the edge of the world 
 Radio's jammed with gospel stations 
 Lost souls callin' long distance salvation 
 Hey mister deejay gotta hear my last prayer 
 It's a hey ho rock and roll, deliver me from nowhere 
 I'm living on the edge of the world 
 Tryin' to get back to you, girl 
 Living on the edge of the world 
 Tryin' to get a message through 
 I gotta make some connection, girl 
 Because I'm living on the edge of the world 
 Living on the edge... 
 I gotta make some connection, girl 
 Because I'm living on the edge of the world 
 Living on the edge of the world 
 Now my boss don't dig me 'cause he put me on the night shift 
 It takes me two hours to get back to where my baby lives 
 In the wee wee hours my mind gets hazy 
 Relay towers, won't you lead me to my baby 
 'Neath the overpass the trooper hits his party lights switch 
 Good night, good luck, one, two, powershift! 
 Living on the edge of the world..."
163,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Wages Of Sin,"When we fight and I wanna talk it out 
 You won't say nothing, nothing at all 
 You just sit there, you won't open that pretty mouth 
 I think you like keeping my back up against the wall 
 Wages of sin, you keep me paying 
 Wages of sin for wrongs that I've done 
 Wages of sin, you keep me paying 
 Wages of sin, one by one 
 I walk in the apartment, there's clothes thrown all over the place 
 You're crouched in the corner with makeup running down your face 
 I don't wanna believe what my heart keeps saying 
 You keep me on the line so you can keep me paying 
 Wages of sin, we keep paying 
 Wages of sin for the wrongs that we've done 
 Wages of sin, we keep paying 
 Wages of sin, that's how we have our fun 
 I remember when I was a little boy out where the cottonwoods grow tall 
 Trying to make it home through the forest before the darkness falls 
 Baby all the sounds I heard, even if they weren't real 
 I was running down that broken path with the devil snapping at my heels 
 I tried so hard, so hard in every way 
 Swore someday I'd grow up, just throw it all away 
 Cried all the tears, baby, that I could cry 
 Stomached all my fears till they came rushin' up inside 
 Darlin' I'm losin' and it's a mean game 
 Still I play on just the same 
 Wages of sin, I keep paying 
 Wages of sin for some wrong that I've done 
 Wages of sin, well I keep paying 
 Wages of sin, one by one"
164,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Take 'Em As They Come,"Last night I dreamed we was running through the outlands 
 Tears streaming, your pretty face all a wreck 
 (I held your daddy's gun in my tremblin' hands) 
 And down the highway another stranger comes 
 You gotta take 'em, baby, when they come 
 Little girl put on your red dress 
 'Cause we're goin' out on the town tonight 
 (Better bring along a switchblade) 
 'Cause, for sure, some fool's gonna wanna fight 
 You've got to take 'em, baby, as they come 
 You gotta take 'em, take 'em as they come, girl 
 Take 'em as they come, girl 
 Take 'em as they come, girl 
 Take 'em, baby, as they come 
 God save the rider in the black night 
 Save the man who taught that it was right 
 (To do what they have done, girl) 
 To become what we have become 
 You gotta take 'em, baby, when they come 
 Little girl, gone are the days 
 Faded away into the clear blue night 
 (And all the vows that we made) 
 Lie shattered and broken in the morning light 
 You gotta take 'em, baby, when they come 
 You gotta take 'em, take 'em as they come, girl 
 Take 'em as they come, girl 
 Take 'em as they come, girl 
 Take 'em, baby, as they come 
 I know your heart is breakin' 
 I can feel it too, girl 
 Though my finger on the trigger's shakin' 
 Here I swear to you, girl 
 If I could take all your sorrow so that you'd never cry, girl, or be blue 
 (Come tomorrow) 
 That's what I'd do for you, pretty one 
 I swear I'll take 'em baby when they come 
 Take 'em as they come, girl 
 Take 'em as they come, girl 
 Take 'em as they come, girl 
 Take 'em, baby, as they come 
 Take 'em as they come, girl 
 Take 'em as they come, girl 
 Take 'em as they come, girl

165,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Ricky Wants A Man Of Her Own,"Well look out mama, your little girl she has changed 
 She cut her baby curls and she's got her act rearranged 
 Well look out daddy, what she needs now she can't find at home 
 Oh Ricky wants a man of her 
 She wants a man of her 
 Ricky wants a man of her own 
 Mama says her little girl won't talk to her anymore 
 She just goes in her room, turns on the radio, and shuts the door 
 She's got her own bathroom, TV, stereo, extension phone 
 Oh but Mama, Ricky wants a man of her 
 She wants a man of her 
 Ricky wants a man of her own 
 Well daddy says when he drops her off Friday night at the gym 
 She slides way down in the front seat so the kids won't see her with him 
 She don't do no work, she won't tell nobody when she's coming home 
 She makes poor daddy wait down on the corner at midnight all alone 
 She used to like me to take her to a ball game or a movie show 
 She used to make daddy take his little girl where she wanna go 
 Now we're left peeking through the curtains every time that we hear a horn blow 
 I guess Ricky wants a man of her own 
 Well my folks say ""Son, talk to her, she'll listen to you"" 
 Yeah, she listens real nice and she does what she wants to do 
 Daddy says she wears her jeans so tight, ""Well you change 'em or you're stayin' 
 Home"" 
 Oh but daddy, Ricky wants a man of her 
 She wants a man of her 
 Ricky wants a man of her own 
 She's almost grown 
 Ricky wants a man of her 
 She wants a man of her"

 That's alright, I don't mind at all 
 Let 'em all tumble right into the sea 
 Well that's just fine, that's alright with me 
 Since you came down the line 
 I can't sleep at night, I got one thing on my mind 
 That's every day, every night 
 I wanna be with you 
 I wanna be with you, that's what I wanna do 
 'Cause you're just so out of sight 
 I wanna be with you, that's what I wanna do

 I got thrown out of my house, I got such a bad reputation 
 'Cause all I wanna do is be seen with you 
 They gave me my pay and said walk 
 I don't care what they say, go ahead and let 'em all talk 
 'Til the world falls apart 
 I wanna be with you 
 I wanna be with you 
 That's what I wanna do 
 Until they will rip out my heart 
 I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you 
 Well that's all I wanna do 
 Hold tight, love me just a little bit 
 Alright, a little bit more 
 Tonight, tonight give me just a little kiss 
 No I don't know, I don't know, I don't 
 I just can't understand it, you're not pretty at all 
 But I come when you whisper, I run when you call 
 When I see you on the street I fall on my face 
 I drop to my knees, I plead my case 
 Oh, oh I wanna be with you 
 I wanna be with you, that's what I wanna do 
 Oh, oh I wanna be with you 
 I wanna be with you, that's all I wanna do 
 Oh, oh I wanna be with you 
 I wanna be with you, darlin', don't you know 
 Oh, oh I wanna be with you 
 I wanna be with you, because I love you so"
167,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Mary Lou,"Your scrapbook's filled with pictures of all your leading men 
 Oh baby don't put my picture in there with them 
 Don't make us some little girl's dream that can never come true 
 Oh baby don't do it to me, I won't do it to you 
 Mary Lou, I'm not like all those other guys 
 Mary Lou, I won't fill your pretty head with their pretty lies 
 Mary Lou, and dreams that never, never, never, ever will come true 
 Mary Lou, that'd only serve to hurt and make you cry like you do 
 You've seen all the romantic movies, you dream and take the boys home 
 But when the action fades you're left all alone 
 Well you deserve better than this, a real love that can grow 
 And I ain't playing outtakes, girl, from some late late show, no 
 Oh, Mary Lou, you're not like all those others girls 
 Mary Lou, so afraid to shake up that neat little world 
 Go Big Man! 
 Big Man, go! 
 Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Let's go! 
 Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Watch out! 
 Every night you go out looking for true love's satisfaction 
 But you always end up setting for just lights, camera, action 
 And another cameo role with some bit player you're befriending 
 You're gonna go broken-hearted looking for that happy ending 
 Mary Lou, I've seen all those movies too 
 Mary Lou, Well I know the hurt too much dreaming can do 
 Oh Mary Lou, you're gonna end up just another lonely ticket sold 
 Mary Lou, crying alone in the theatre as the credits roll 
 Let's go! 
 Doo, doo-doo, doo, doo-doo, doo, doo-doo"
168,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Johnny Bye-Bye,"Well, she drew out all her money from the Southern Trust 
 And put her little boy on the Greyhound bus 
 Leaving Memphis with a guitar in his hand 
 With a one-way ticket to the promised land 
 Hey, little girl with the red dress on 
 There's party, tonight, down in Memphis town 
 I'll be going down there if you need a ride 
 The man on the radio says Elvis Presley's died 
 We drove to Memphis, the sky was hard and black 
 Up over the ridge came a white Cadillac 
 They drawed out all his money, and they laid him in the back 
 A woman cried from the roadside: Oh, he's gone, he's gone 
 They found him slumped up against the drain 
 With a whole lotta trouble running through his veins 
 Bye-bye, Johnny 
 Johnny, bye-bye 
 You didn't have to die 
 You didn't have to die"
169,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Shut Out The Light,"The runway rushed up at him as he felt the wheels touch down 
 He stood out on the blacktop and took a taxi into town 
 He got out down on Main Street and went into a local bar 
 He bought a drink and found a seat in a corner off the dark 
 Well she called up her mama to make sure the kids were out of the house 
 She checked herself out in the dining room mirror 
 And undid an extra button on her blouse 
 He felt her lying next to him, the clock said 4:00 am 
 He was staring at the ceiling 
 He couldn't move his hands 
 Oh mama mama mama come quick 
 I've got the shakes and I'm gonna be sick 
 Throw your arms around me in the cold dark night 
 Hey now mama don't shut out the light 
 Don't you shut out the light 
 Don't you shut out the light 
 Don't you shut out the light 
 Don't you shut out the light 
 Well on his porch they stretched a banner that said ""Johnny Welcome Home"" 
 Bobby pulled his Ford out of the garage and they polished up the chrome 
 His mama said ""Johnny oh Johnny, I'm so glad to have you back with me"" 
 His pa said he was sure they'd give him his job back down at the factory 
 Oh mama mama mama come quick 
 I've got the shakes and I'm gonna be sick 
 Throw your arms around me in the cold dark night 
 Hey now mama don't shut out the light 
 Don't you shut out the light 
 Don't you shut out the light 
 Don't you shut out the light 
 Don't you shut out the light 
 Well deep in a dark forest, a forest filled with rain 
 Beyond a stretch of Maryland pines there's a river without a name 
 In the cold black water Johnson Lineir stands 
 He stares across the lights of the city and dreams of where he's been"
170,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Cynthia,"Cynthia, when you come walkin' by you're an inspiring sight 
 Cynthia, you don't smile or say hi but baby that's all right 
 'Cause I don't need to hold you or taste your kiss 
 I just like knowin', Cynthia, you exist 
 In a world like this 
 Cynthia, when you pass it seems like this whole town drops 
 Cynthia, or maybe it's just me, baby, and these fools stuck here punchin' this 
 Clock 
 Well you give us a reason to stop just for a while 
 Stop, stand and salute your style 
 Well now you ain't the finest thing I'll never have 
 And when you go the hurt you leave, baby, it ain't so bad 
 There ain't a man in this whole town who'd say you ain't fine 
 You hear them guys talkin', tell me baby do you mind 
 Well you make us happy, honey, when we feel sad 
 To see something so good in a world gone bad 
 There's still Cynthia 
 Cynthia, no one knows your number, no one knows where you live 
 Cynthia, I wonder do you understand this strange thing you give 
 Well baby is it your style, the mystery in your smile 
 Or just how cool you walk in a world gone wild 
 Tell me if you will, Cynthia 
 Well I gotta be pretty naÜve to believe in you 
 I know you ain't ever gonna be my dream come true 
 That's all right, I got other dreams as good as you, Cynthia 
 Yeah now baby, now this ain't no come-on

 You make me holler, yeah, yeah, all right 
 I said yeah, yeah, all right 
 Well she's a yeah, yeah, all right"
171,Bruce Springsteen,rock,My Love Will Not Let You Down,"At night I go to bed but I just can't sleep 
 I got something running around my head 
 That just won't keep 
 In the silence I hear my heart beating, time slippin' away 
 I got a time bomb ticking deep inside of me 
 I gotta tell you what I wanna say 
 I keep searching for you, darling 
 Searching everywhere I go 
 And when I find you there's gonna be 
 Just one thing that you gotta know 
 My love will not let you down 
 My love will not let you down 
 At night I walk the streets looking for romance 
 But I always end up stumbling in a half-trance 
 I search for connection in some new eyes 
 But they're hard for protection from too many dreams passed by 
 I see you standing across the room watching me without a sound 
 Well I'm gonna push my way through that crowd, I'm gonna tear all your walls 
 Down 
 Tear all your walls down 
 My love will not let you down 
 My love will not let you down 
 Well hold still now darling, hold still for God's sake 
 'Cause I got me a promise I ain't afraid to make 
 My love will not let you down"
172,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Frankie,"Dark weekends in the sun out on Chelsea Road 
 Descending the stairs, Frankie, my one 
 Check your makeup in the mirror c'mon babe let's go 
 We'll dance 'round this dirty town 'til the night is all done 
 Let all the finer things sleep alone tonight 
 Let all the minor kings lose their thrones tonight 
 Don't worry about us, baby, we'll be alright 
 Well everybody's dying, this town's closing down 
 They're all sittin' down at the courthouse waiting for 'em to take the flag down 
 I see strange flashes in the sky up above 
 Gonna spend the night at the drive-in with the one that I love 
 At dusk the stars all appear on the screen 
 Yeah, just like they do each night in my dreams 
 But tonight's no dream, Frankie, I can feel myself too 
 Well now and forever my love is for you 
 Walk softly tonight little stranger 
 Yeah into these shadows we're passing through 
 Talk softly tonight, little angel 
 You make all my dream worlds come true 
 Well lately I've been standing out in the freezing rain 
 Readin' them want ads out on Chelsea Road 
 I'm winging down the street in search of new games 
 Hustling through these nightlights' diamond glow 
 Well Frankie I don't know what I'm gonna find 
 Maybe nothing at all, maybe a world I can call mine 
 Shining like these streetlights down here on the strand 
 Bright as the rain in the palm of your hand 
 Walk softly tonight, little stranger 
 Into the shadows where lovers go 
 Talk softly to me, little angel"
173,Bruce Springsteen,rock,TV Movie,"I woke up last night shaking from a dream

 He had mud caked on his goggles and a screamin' 350 stacked up on his back 
 Well as he passed the stands he was feelin' all tuckered out, 
 When through the roar of his engine he heard somebody shout 
 ""Stand on it, come on boy, stand on it"" 
 Mary Beth started to drift, she hit the shift but she just couldn't get a hand on it 
 Racin' some Red Hill boys, she had the deed to the ranch and a grand on it 
 With eight grand blowin' hot on the red line 
 She blew past a hitchhiker out on Route 39 
 He hollered ""Stand on it, go 'head baby, stand on it"" 
 Well now when in doubt and you can't figure it out 
 Just stand on it 
 Well, if your mind's confused, you don't know what you're gonna do 
 Well buddy, stand on it

 Go grab a girl; go see a rock and roll band 
 And stand on it

 Shouting ""Stand on it, go ahead man, stand on it""

 Somebody shouted ""Man, you call that drivin'? 
 Why didn't you stand on it?"""

 And he settled that argument with a razor in his hand 
 With blood on his shirt back to Mary he did run 
 She sighed ""Billy, oh Billy, what have you done?"" 
 He ran to his ma's trailer but the lights were dim 
 He pounded on the door, she wouldn't let him in 
 Up the road to a neighbor's house he drew near 
 They said ""Billy go away, we don't want no trouble 'round here"" 
 Billy stole a car and headed out on the road 
 Pocketful of pills and his brain on overload 
 Seen some lights in his rearview mirror, panicked and gave her the gun 
 Wrapped himself 'round a telephone pole way out on 101 
 Well Billy got cut out by the highway patrol 
 Just lay there with the cars passing on slow 
 Sheriff told Billy's ma that Billy died

178,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Brothers Under The Bridges,"Every spring when the weather gets warm 
 They come pourin' into town straight off of them farms 
 Driving 455s running hard and strong 
 They'd scratch built in them tool sheds all winter long 
 'Neath the trestless drinkin' the beer and the wine 
 Now some came on run, some just to pass the time 
 With the brothers under the bridges 
 Me and Tommy we was just fourteen, didn't have our licenses yet 
 Our walls were covered with pictures of cars we'd get 
 We'd listen and wait for that highway to rumble and quake 
 As they drove in through town when the weekend'd break 
 Bringin' girls with that distant look in their eyes 
 Now together 'neath the trestless they'd be laughing in the night 
 With the brothers under the bridges 
 Well me and my brother'd hitched a ride in Joey's pickup to the edge of town 
 And we watched from the tall grass as the challenges were made and the duels went down 
 We'd hitchhike back home, sneak in, get in bed before our mom'd come 
 And we'd lay there in the night talkin' about how we might someday be one 
 Yeah someday run with the brothers under the bridges 
 Well now I hear a cry in the distance and the sound of marching feet come and gone 
 Well I'm stittin' down here by this highway figuring, figuring just where I belong tonight up on Signal Hill 
 I watch a young man in a red shirt walking through a night so still 
 Put his jacket 'round his girl as the autumn wind send a chill"

 Doing something they know is wrong

 And they tempt you, sir, with gold 
 And they tempt you with the pleasure 
 That the flesh does surely hold 
 They say Eve tempted Adam with an apple 
 But, man, I ain't going for that 
 I know it was her Pink Cadillac 
 Crushed velvet seats 
 Riding in the back 
 Oozing down the street 
 Waving to the girls 
 Feeling out of sight 
 Spending all my money on a Saturday night 
 Honey, I just wonder what it feels like in the back of your pink Cadillac

 And uses too much gas 
 Some folks say it's too old 
 And that it goes too fast

 Yeah, it's bigger than a Subaru 
 Hey, man, there's only one thing 
 And one car that will do 
 Anyway, we don't have to drive it 
 Honey, we can park it out in back 
 And have a party in your Pink Cadillac 
 Crushed velvet seats

 Oozing down the street

 I got one kiss for you honey so come on let's go 
 I didn't see it coming but girl now I know 
 It takes one for the running but two for the road 
 One thousand dreams whispered in the dark 
 But a dream's just a dream in one empty heart 
 It takes more than one to rev it up and go 
 So let's get it running, we're two for the road 
 Two one-way tickets and a diamond ring 
 Hell it don't matter what the rain might bring 
 When this world treats you hard and cold 
 I'll stand beside you, we're two for the road 
 When you're alone my love'll shine the light 
 Through the dark and starless night 
 I'll hold you close and never let you go

184,Bruce Springsteen,rock,The Wish,"Dirty old street all slushed up in the rain and snow 
 Little boy and his ma shivering outside a rundown music store window 
 That night on top of a Christmas tree shines one beautiful star 
 And lying underneath a brand-new Japanese guitar 
 I remember in the morning, ma, hearing your alarm clock ring 
 I'd lie in bed and listen to you gettin' ready for work 
 The sound of your makeup case on the sink 
 And the ladies at the office, all lipstick, perfume and rustlin' skirts 
 And how proud and happy you always looked walking home from work 
 If pa's eyes were windows into a world so deadly and true 
 You couldn't stop me from looking but you kept me from crawlin' through 
 And if it's a funny old world, mama, where a little boy's wishes come true 
 Well I got a few in my pocket and a special one just for you 
 It ain't no phone call on Sunday, flowers or a mother's day card 
 It ain't no house on a hill with a garden and a nice little yard 
 I got my hot rod down on Bond Street, I'm older but you'll know me in a glance 
 We'll find us a little rock 'n' roll bar and baby we'll go out and dance 
 Well it was me in my Beatle boots, you in pink curlers and matador pants 
 Pullin' me up of the couch to do the twist for my uncles and aunts 
 Well I found a girl of my own now, ma, I popped the question on your birthday 
 She stood waiting on the front porch while you were telling me to get out there 
 And say what it was that I had to say 
 Last night we all sat around laughing at the things that guitar brought us 
 And I laid awake thinking 'bout the other things it's brought us 
 Well tonight I'm takin's requests here in the kitchen 
 This one's for you, ma, let me come right out and say it 
 It's overdue, but baby, if you're looking for a sad song, well I ain't gonna play it"

 Folks congratulate you, church bells ring 
 Who's got the ring, who's gonna pay the priest 
 Get your mama in the paper, picture or two at least 
 And at the reception all the old records play 
 ""Where you gonna live, are you gonna taker her away?"" 
 In a corner my new nephew's showin' me his knife 
 You swore that you'd love her for the rest of your life 
 Went to kiss you at the altar we bumped heads 
 Honeymoon night we figured we best shake on it instead 
 Dressed kinda funny, laughin' we hop in bed 
 You can swear it on your feet, you can swear it on your head 
 Come mornin' my new famlily's sitting on the front porch swing 
 Smilin' kinda funny, nobody says a thing 
 My new brother-in-law's throwin' a football, he tosses me a pass"

 Said you're a lucky man 
 Some folks got fortune some got eyes of blue 
 What you got will always see you through 
 You're a lucky man

 I make my living with my hands behind the wheel of this car 
 I'm a lucky man 
 Messin' with me man wouldn't be wise 
 Roll them dice son - ah snake eyes 
 I'm a lucky man 
 Had a girl in Calgary I gave her up 
 Man that love thing was messin' with my luck 
 I'm a lucky man 
 I'll wake up tomorrow morning in another state 
 Kiss me now baby before it's too late 
 If you wanna kiss a lucky man 
 I don't miss no girl I don't miss no home 
 He travels fastest who travels alone 
 He's a lucky man"
187,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Leavin' Train,"When I asked you if everything is alright 
 You whisper ""Don't worry"" and you shut out the light 
 Now black is black in this bed we're laying 
 And I wanna believe the words that you're saying 
 But your eyes look like a leavin' train 
 They keep on dragging me down 
 Your eyes look like a leavin' train 
 They keep on draggin' 
 They keep on draggin' 
 They keep on draggin' me down 
 Well I did anything just to try to get close to you 
 I took it step by step like a man's supposed to 
 Tell me now, is this my 
 Is this my contrition 
 To have the love that I longed for fill me with suspicion 
 But your eyes look like a leavin' train 
 They keep on dragging me down 
 Your eyes look like a leavin' train 
 They keep on draggin' 
 They keep on draggin' 
 They keep on draggin' me down 
 Now it's tellin' time, oh my little sister 
 Now can I believe the words, the words of love you whisper 
 Is my train in vain, has my soul gone to waste 
 Am I just a victim of, a victim of my lost faith"
188,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Seven Angels,"Seven angels got my number 
 Since I fell in love with you 
 Seven angels got my number 
 They're all telling me what to do 
 First angel says ""Go on and love her"" 
 Second angels says ""Ain't you tired of being alone?"" 
 Third angel says ""Do the right thing, me."" 
 Fourth angels says ""Check that other little angel walkin' on down the street"" 
 Seven angels got my number 
 Since I fell in love with you 
 Seven angels got my number 
 They're all telling me what to do 
 Fifth angels says ""Don't worry 
 Love's waitin' 'round the corner for you, son"" 
 Sixth angel says ""You better hurry 
 It don't take long for the good to get gone"" 
 Walkin' on wings all sexy and blue 
 Seventh angel says I'm a fool 
 I got seven angels calling on my pride 
 Seven devils crawling around inside 
 Seven angels tellin' me which way to turn 
 One kiss and my soul wanna burn 
 Seven angels got my number 
 Since I fell in love with you 
 Seven angels got my number 
 They're all telling me what to do 
 The earth's so lonely, sad and blue 
 And without love, your soul's dyin' 
 Sixth angel says to believe you 
 When you say you'll never leave me cryin'"
189,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Gave It A Name,"In the fields of the Lord stood Abel and Cain 
 Cain slew Abel 'neath the black rain 
 At night he couldn't stand the guilt or the blame 
 So he gave it a name 
 So he gave it a name 
 So he gave it a name 
 Billy got drunk, angry at his wife 
 He hit her once, he hit her twice 
 At night he'd lie in bed, he couldn't stand the shame 
 So he gave it a name 
 So he gave it a name 
 So he gave it a name 
 Pa told me ""Son, one thing I know is true 
 Poison snake bites you, you're poison too"" 
 At night I can feel that poison runnin' 'round my veins..."
190,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Sad Eyes,"Every day here you come walking 
 I hold my tongue, I don't do much talking 
 You say you're happy and you're doin' fine 
 Well go ahead baby, I got plenty of time 
 Because Sad eyes never lie 
 Because Sad eyes never lie 
 Well for a while I've been watching you steady 
 Ain't gonna move 'til you're good and ready 
 You show up and then you shy away 
 But I know pretty soon you'll be walkin' this way 
 Because Sad eyes never lie 
 Because Sad eyes never lie 
 Baby don't you know I don't care 
 Don't you know that I've been there 
 Well if something in the air feels a little unkind 
 Don't worry darling, it'll slip your mind 
 I know you think you'd never be mine 
 Well that's okay baby, I don't mind 
 That shy smile's sweet, that's a fact 
 Go ahead, I don't mind the act 
 Here you come all dressed up for a date 
 Well one more step and it'll be too late 
 Blue blue ribbon in your hair 
 Like you're so sure I'll be standing here ..."
191,Bruce Springsteen,rock,My Lover Man,"You treated me hard and made my heart ache 
 I know you're only human, and men they make mistakes 
 Your life with her turned to black 
 And now you want our love back 
 Well come into my arms and fall, my lover man 
 Was it a gypsy's curse or a hex sign 
 Or was it just that simple thing that led you from these arms of mine 
 Oh yes, I've had the days 
 To grow used to your foolish ways 
 And what is it really, after all, my lover man 
 I can see the change in your eyes 
 There's no need to apologize 
 We stood at the wishing well 
 Our dreams like coins into the water fell 
 The water so cold and black 
 There was no going back 
 I don't mean to cause you hurt or cause you pain 
 Life is short and love's a dirty game 
 Now there's no need for our game to end 
 Come close and we'll begin 
 To find our beautiful selves again, my lover man 
 My lover man"
192,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Over The Rise,"I walk along the levee to see the gypsy man 
 The dirt 'neath my feet baby's turnin' to quicksand 
 He looked into my palm, then looked me in the eye 
 And told me you were gone, gone over the rise 
 Once we stood together at the wishing well 
 Our wishes like dreams, baby, into the water fell 
 Oh then I kissed your lips but when I looked into your eyes 
 They were gone, gone over the rise 
 Tonight the blackbirds fly low on the water's edge 
 Oh we walked this path not knowing where it led 
 Now at the bottom of the river deep lies something shiny and gold 
 Is a promise that love couldn't keep same as a promise broken* 
 Well I woke last night to the sound of rain 
 The wind rustling branches against the window pane 
 I searched the pillow beside me for the tears we cried 
 Baby they were gone, gone over the rise"
193,Bruce Springsteen,rock,When The Lights Go Out,"Now you say you have a friend, you trust him with your life 
 You trust him with your money, you trust him with your kids 
 You'd even trust him with your wife 
 You better watch what's goin' on when the lights are out 
 When the night is dark, when there ain't nobody lookin' around 
 Yeah when the lights are out, down in this dirty little town 
 Well now the world is dark and funny, better listen up to what I say 
 You ain't gonna know what's going on by what you see in the light of day 
 You gotta watch what's goin' on when the lights are out 
 When the night is dark, when there ain't nobody lookin' around 
 Yeah when the lights are out in this dirty little town 
 Now you swear that she trusted you 
 Within reason I understand 
 But you kept slippin' in late at night 
 And in the mornin' you had that smell on your hands 
 Well now the world is turning, Rome is burning 
 Me, I'm watching and I'm learning 
 They say sure as God's hand and the tickin' of the clock 
 The lord's light'll shine under every slimy rock 
 Well last night I slept the sleep of fear 
 And I heard God's voice whisper in my ear 
 He said you better watch what's going on when the lights are out 
 When the night is dark, when there ain't nobody lookin' around 
 Yeah when the lights are out, down in this dirty little town"
194,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Loose Change,"Met her at a friendly little bar down along the coast 
 She said it was her birthday so we had us a nice little toast 
 Drove around for a while, smoked a few cigarettes 
 Took her back to my place, she slipped off her party dress 
 She sat for a while on the edge of the bed just talkin' 
 Loose change in my pocket 
 Loose change in my pocket 
 Pint of gin in my boot cuff, I'm drivin' for a drink and a dance 
 Sittin' on the next stool, miss a little time on her hands 
 Yeah I knew she was trouble, but trouble sure was lookin' fine 
 And when I pulled her close what I knew kinda slipped my mind 
 We lay in bed and watched the moon come up crawling 
 Loose change in my pocket 
 Loose change in my pocket 
 I pour another drink, wait for the night to get through 
 Stars are burning in that black void so far away and blue 
 Now I'm sittin' at a red light I feel somethin' tickin' way down 
 The night's moving like a slow train crawling through this shithole town 
 Got my bags packed in the back and I'm tryin' to get going again 
 But red just goes to green and green goes red and then 
 Then all I hear's the clock on the dash tick-tocking 
 Loose change in my pocket"
195,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Trouble In Paradise,"You do the drying, I'll do the dishes 
 Who'll do the crying when all the wishes don't come true 
 You do the washing, I'll do the folding 
 Whose heart is breaking 
 When whose arms are holding someone new 
 Sittin' on a peaceful lake sunnin' 
 Didn't hear the roar of the waterfall coming 
 When it's all a storybook story 
 When it's all so easy and nice 
 Here comes trouble in paradise 
 You did the dusting, I did the sweeping 
 You did the driving oh and I did the sleeping a little too long 
 On a picnic 'neath the sky so blue 
 We didn't see the rain and heartache coming through 
 When it's all an old black and white movie 
 And you're sure you've seen the ending twice 
 Here comes trouble in paradise 
 You said everything was fine 
 I'm sorry, baby, I didn't see the signs 
 Oh so beautifully you read your lines 
 But in a play where the hero has no vice 
 And love comes without a price 
 So does trouble in paradise 
 Don't matter who did the dusting or who did the sweeping 
 Who did the trusting or who did the cheating when it's all gone 
 Laying in a field on a summer's day 
 Waitin' for those gray skies to clear away 
 Knowing all love's glory and beauty 
 Can vanish before you think twice 
 Leaving trouble in paradise 
 Now we share the laughing, we share the joking 
 We do the sleeping with one eye open"
196,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Happy,"Some need gold and some need diamond rings 
 Or a drug to take away the pain that living brings 
 A promise of a better world to come 
 When whatever here is done 
 I don't need that sky of blue 
 All I know's since I found you, I'm happy when I'm in your arms 
 Happy, darling, come the dark 
 Happy when I taste your kiss 
 I'm happy in a love like this 
 There's a house upon a distant hill 
 Where you can hear the laughter of children ring 
 Guardian angels, they watch from above 
 Watching over the love that they bring 
 But at night I feel the darkness near, I awake and I find you near 
 I'm happy with you in my arms 
 I'm happy with you in my heart 
 Happy when I taste your kiss 
 I'm happy in love like this 
 In a world of doubt and fear 
 I wake at night and reach to find you near 
 Lost in a dream, you caught me as I fell 
 I want more than just a dream to tell 
 We're born in this world, darling, with few days and trouble never far behind 
 Man and woman circle each other in a cage 
 A cage that's been handed down the line 
 Lost and running 'neath a million dead stars 
 Tonight let's shed our skins and slip these bars 
 Happy in each other's arms 
 Happy, baby, come the dark 
 Happy in each other's kiss"
197,Bruce Springsteen,rock,"Part Man, Part Monkey","They prosecuted some poor sucker in these United States 
 For teaching that man descended from the apes 
 They coulda settled that case without a fuss or fight 
 If they'd seen me chasin' you, sugar, through the jungle last night 
 They'da called in that jury and a one two three said 
 Part man, part monkey, definitely 
 Well the church bell rings from the corner steeple 
 Man in a monkey suit swears he'll do no evil 
 Offers his lover's prayer but his soul lies 
 Dark and driftin' and unsatisfied 
 Well hey bartender, tell me whaddaya see 
 Part man, part monkey, looks like to me 
 Well the night is dark, the moon is full 
 The flowers of romance exert their pull 
 We talk awhile, my fingers slip 
 I'm hard and crackling like a whip 
 Well did God make man in a breath of holy fire 
 Or did he crawl on up out of the muck and mire 
 Well the man on the street believes what the bible tells him so 
 Well you can ask me, mister, because I know 
 Tell them soul-suckin' preachers to come on down and see 
 Part man, part monkey, baby that's me"
198,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Goin' Cali,"Well he'd been hearing too many voices and feelin'a little off-rack 
 Like there was something big pressing down on his back 
 So he called up his friends and they said come on out west 
 It's a place where a man can really feel his succes 
 So he pulled his heart and soul down off the shelf 
 Packed them next to the faith that he'd lost in himself 
 Said his good-byes and when the dirty work was done 
 He turned his wheels into the fading sun 
 For seven days and nights like a black-top bird he sped 
 Maintained radio silence 'cept for in his head 
 And just like his folks did back in '69 
 He crossed the border at Needles and heard the promised land on the line 
 Now where the Transcontinental dumps into the sea 
 There's a bar made up to look like 1963 
 Girl in the corner eyed him like a hungry dog a bone 
 As he brushed the desert dust off that Mercedes chrome 
 Bartender said ""Hey, how's it hangin', tiger?"" 
 He had a shot of tequila, smiled and whispered ""lighter"" 
 He went down to the desert city where the rattlesnakes play 
 And left his dead skin by the roadside in the noon of day 
 Sun got so hot it almost felt like friend 
 It could burn out every trace of where you been 
 There was a woman he'd met in a desert song 
 A little while later a son come along 
 Looked at that boy's smile and called it home"
199,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Back In Your Arms,"In my dream, our love was lost 
 I lived by luck and fate 
 I carried you inside of me 
 Prayed it wouldn't be too late 
 Now I'm standin' on this empty road 
 Where nothin' moves but the wind 
 And, honey, I just wanna be 
 Back in your arms 
 Back in your arms again 
 Back in your arms 
 Back in your arms again 
 Oh, once I was your treasure 
 And I saw your face in every star 
 But these promises we make at night 
 Oh, that's all they are 
 Unless we fill them with faith and love they're 
 Empty as the howlin' wind 
 And, honey, I just wanna be 
 Back in your arms 
 Back in your arms again 
 Back in your arms 
 Back in your arms again 
 Back in your arms 
 Back in your arms again 
 You came to me with love and kindness 
 But all my life I've been a prisoner of my own blindness 
 I met you with indifference 
 And I don't know why 
 Now I wake from my dream 
 I wake from my dream to this world 
 Where all is shadow and darkness 
 And above me, a dark sky unfurls 
 And all the love I've thrown away and lost 
 I'm longin' for again 
 Now, darlin', I just wanna be 
 Back in your arms 
 Back in your arms again 
 Back in your arms 
 Back in your arms again 
 Back in your arms 
 Back in your arms again 
 Back in your arms 
 Back in your arms again"
200,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Brothers Under The Bridge,"Saigon, it was all gone 
 The same Coke machines 
 As the streets I grew on 
 Down in a mesquite canyon 
 We come walking along the ridge 
 Me and the brothers under the bridge 
 Campsite's an hour's walk from the nearest road to town 
 Up here there's too much brush and canyon 
 For the CHP choppers to touch down 
 Ain't lookin' for nothin', just wanna live 
 Me and the brothers under the bridge 
 Come the Santa Ana's, man, that dry brush'll light 
 Billy Devon got burned up in his own campfire one winter night 
 We buried his body in the white stone high up along the ridge 
 Me and the brothers under the bridge 
 Had enough of town and the street life 
 Over nothing you end up on the wrong end of someone's knife 
 Now I don't want no trouble 
 And I ain't got none to give 
 Me and the brothers under the bridge 
 I come home in '72 
 You were just a beautiful light 
 In your mama's dark eyes of blue 
 I stood down on the tarmac, I was just a kid 
 Me and the brothers under the bridge 
 Come Veterans' Day I sat in the stands in my dress blues 
 I held your mother's hand 
 When they passed with the red, white and blue"
201,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Trouble River,"There's a river runs through this valley 
 Cold and deep and black 
 Comin' like a tombstone shadow across my back 
 Trouble river, six foot high and risin' 
 Trouble river, I can't keep from cryin' 
 I woke up last night shakin' 
 Shakin' from a dream 
 That all I seen was smiling faces staring back at me 
 Trouble river, six foot high and risin' 
 Trouble river, I can't keep from cryin' 
 Snakes crawling in the hi house 
 I'm stuck in muddy ground 
 Tonight I'm gonna shed this skin 
 And I'll be breathin' free air now 
 Trouble river, six foot high and risin' 
 Trouble river, I can't keep from cryin'"
202,Bruce Springsteen,rock,The Fever,"When I get home from my job I turn on my TV 
 But I can't keep my mind on the show 
 When I lay down at night, oh, I can't get no sleep 
 So I turn on my radio 
 But the only sound I hear is you whisperin' in my ear 
 The words that you used to say 
 Now my days grow longer 
 'Cause my love grows stronger 
 And the fever gets worse 
 And I've got the fever for this girl 
 Got the fever, oh, I've got the fever 
 Nothing that a po' boy can do 
 When he's got the fever for this girl 
 Got the fever, oh, I've got the fever 
 Left this little boy blue 
 I can remember coming home 
 See you standing at the stove 
 With the dishes on the table 
 Dinner ready to go 
 We'll maybe go out to a movie show 
 Something that you like to see 
 Well now you are my sun in the morning 
 And my moon at night 
 I think about you baby 
 I feel alright 
 Now my days grow longer 
 'Cause my love grows stronger 
 And the fever gets worse 
 And I've got the fever for this girl"
203,Bruce Springsteen,rock,The Promise,"Johnny works in a factory and Billy works downtown 
 Terry works in a rock and roll band lookin' for that million-dollar sound 
 And I got a little job down in Darlington but some nights I don't go 
 Some nights I go to the drive-in or some nights I stay home 
 I followed that dream just like those guys do up on the screen 
 And I drive a Challenger down Route 9 through the dead ends and all the bad scenes 
 And when the promise was broken, I cashed in a few of my dream. 
 Well, now I built that Challenger by myself but I needed money and so I sold it 
 I lived a secret I should'a kept to myself but I got drunk one night and I told it 
 All my life I fought this fight, the fight that no man can never win 
 Every day it just gets harder to live this dream I'm believing in. 
 Thunder Road, oh baby, you were so right 
 Thunder Road, there's something dyin' on the highway tonight. 
 I won big once and I hit the coast, oh, but somehow I paid the big cost 
 Inside I felt like I was carryin' the broken spirits of all the other ones who lost 
 When the promise is broken, you go on living but it steals something from down in your soul 
 Like when the truth is spoken and it don't make no difference, something in your heart goes cold. 
 Thunder Road, for the lost lovers and all the fixed games 
 Thunder Road, for the tires rushing by in the rain 
 Thunder Road, Billy and me we'd always say. 
 Thunder Road, we were gonna take it all then threw it all away."
204,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Land Of Hope And Dreams,"Grab your ticket and your suitcase

 Lay your head upon my chest 
 We'll take what we can carry 
 And we'll leave the rest 
 Big Wheels rolling through fields 
 Where sunlight streams 
 Meet me in a land of hope and dreams 
 I will provide for you 
 And I'll stand by your side 
 You'll need a good companion for 
 This part of the ride 
 Leave behind your sorrows 
 Let this day be the last 
 Tomorrow there'll be sunshine 
 And all this darkness past 
 Big wheels roll through fields

 I hope that you're coming to stay 
 I'm waitin' 
 Waitin' on a sunny day 
 Gonna chase the clouds away 
 Yeah, I'm waitin' on a sunny day 
 Hard times, baby well they come to us all 
 Sure as the ticking of the clock on the wall 
 Sure as the turning of the night into day 
 Your smile, girl, brings the morning light to my eyes 
 Lifts away the blues when I rise 
 I hope that you're coming to stay 
 I'm waitin' 
 Waitin' on a sunny day 
 Gonna chase the clouds away 
 Yeah, I'm waitin' on a sunny day"
209,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Nothing Man,"I don't remember how I felt, I never thought I'd live 
 To read about myself in my hometown paper 
 How my brave young life was forever changed 
 In a misty cloud of pink vapor 
 Darlin' give me your kiss 
 Only understand 
 I am the nothing man 
 Around here everybody acts the same 
 Around here everybody acts like nothing's changed 
 Friday night club meets at Al's Barbecue 
 The sky is still the same unbelievable blue 
 Darlin' give me your kiss 
 Come and take my hand 
 I am the nothing man 
 You can call me Joe, buy me a drink and shake my hand 
 You want courage, I'll show you courage you can understand 
 Pearl and silver restin' on my night table 
 It's just me Lord, pray I'm able 
 Darlin' with this kiss 
 Say you understand 
 I am the nothing man 
 I am the nothing man"
210,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Countin' On A Miracle,"It's a fairytale so tragic 
 There's no prince to break the spell 
 I don't believe in magic 
 But for you I will 
 Yeah, for you I will 
 If I'm a fool, I'll be a fool 
 Darlin' for you 
 I'm countin' on a miracle 
 Baby, I'm countin' on a miracle 
 Darlin' I'm countin' on a miracle 
 To come through 
 There ain't no story book story 
 There's no never-ending song 
 Our happily ever after, darlin' 
 Forever come and gone 
 I'm movin' on 
 If I'm gonna believe 
 I'll put my faith 
 Darlin' in you 
 I'm countin' on a miracle 
 Baby, I'm countin' on a miracle 
 Darlin' I'm countin' on a miracle 
 To come through 
 Sleeping beauty awakes from her dream 
 With her lover's kiss on her lips 
 Your kiss was taken from me 
 Now all I have is this 
 Your kiss, your kiss 
 Your touch, your touch 
 Your heart, your heart 
 Your strength, your strength 
 Your hope, your hope, 
 Your faith, your faith 
 Your face, your face 
 Your love, your love 
 Your dream, your dream 
 Your life, your life 
 I'm runnin' through the forest 
 With the wolf at my heels 
 My king is lost at midnight 
 When the tower bells peal 
 We've got no fairytale ending 
 In God's hand our fate is complete 
 Your heaven's here in my heart 
 Our love's this dust beneath my feet 
 Just this dust beneath my feet 
 If I'm gonna live 
 I'll lift my life 
 Darlin' to you 
 I'm countin' on a miracle 
 Baby, I'm countin' on a miracle 
 Darlin' I'm countin' on a miracle 
 To come through 
 Well I'm countin' on a miracle

211,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Empty Sky,"I woke up this morning 
 I could barely breathe 
 Just an empty impression 
 In the bed where you used to be 
 I want a kiss from your lips 
 I want an eye for an eye 
 I woke up this morning 
 To the empty sky 
 Empty sky, empty sky 
 I woke up this morning to an empty sky 
 Empty sky, empty sky 
 I woke up this morning to an empty sky 
 Blood on the streets 
 Blood flowin' down 
 I hear the blood of my blood 
 Cryin' from the ground 
 Empty sky, empty sky 
 I woke up this morning to an empty sky 
 Empty sky, empty sky 
 I woke up this morning to an empty sky 
 On the plains of Jordan 
 I cut my bow from the wood 
 Of this tree of evil 
 Of this tree of good 
 I want a kiss from your lips 
 I want an eye for an eye 
 I woke up this morning 
 To the empty sky 
 Empty sky, empty sky

212,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Worlds Apart,"I hold you in my arms, yeah, that's where it starts 
 I seek faith in your kiss and comfort in your heart 
 I taste the seed upon your lips, lay my tongue upon your scars 
 I look into your eyes and we stand worlds apart 
 Where the distant oceans sing and rise to the plain 
 In this dry and troubled country, your beauty remains 
 Down from the mountain roads where the highway rolls to dark 
 'Neath Allah's blessed rain, we remain worlds apart 
 Sometimes the truth just ain't enough or it's too much in times like this 
 Let's throw the truth away, we'll find it in this kiss 
 In your skin upon my skin, in the beating of our hearts 
 May the living let us in before the dead tear us apart 
 We'll let blood build a bridge over mountains draped in stars 
 I'll meet you on the ridge between these worlds apart 
 We've got this moment now to live, then it's all just dust and dark 
 Let love give what it gives, let's let love give what it gives"
213,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Let's Be Friends (Skin To Skin),"I've been watching you a long time 
 Trying to figure out where and when 
 We've been moving down that same line 
 Time is now, maybe we could get skin to skin 
 Don't know when this chance might come again 
 Good times got a way of coming to an end 
 Don't know when this chance might come again 
 Good times got a way of slipping away 
 Baby, let's be friends 
 Come on, let's be friends 
 I know we're different you and me 
 Got a different way of walking 
 Time has come to let the past be history 
 Yeah, if we just start talking 
 Don't know when this chance might come again 
 Good things got a way of coming to an end 
 Don't know when this chance might come again 
 Good things got a way of slipping away 
 Baby, let's be friends 
 Come on, let's be friends 
 Baby, let's be friends 
 Come on, let's be friends 
 Baby, let's be friends 
 There's a lot of talk going 'round now 
 Let them talk, you know you're the only one 
 There's a lot of walls need tearing down 
 Together we could take 'em down one by one 
 Don't know when this chance might come again 
 Good times got a way of coming to an end 
 Don't know when this chance might come again 
 Good times got a way of slipping away 
 Baby, let's be friends 
 Come on, let's be friends 
 Baby, let's be friends 
 Come on, let's be friends

 Come on, let's be friends"
214,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Further On (Up The Road),"Where the road is dark and the seed is sowed 
 Where the gun is cocked and the bullet's cold 
 Where the miles are marked in blood and gold 
 I'll meet you further on up the road 
 Got on my dead man's suit and my smiling skull ring 
 My lucky graveyard boots and song to sing 
 I got a song to sing, keep me out of the cold 
 And I'll meet you further on up the road 
 Further on up the road, further on up the road 
 Where the way is dark and the night is cold 
 One sunny morning we'll rise I know 
 And I'll meet you further on up the road 
 Now I been out in the desert, just doing my time 
 Searching through the dust, looking for a sign 
 If there's a light up ahead, well brother, I don't know 
 But I got this fever burning in my soul 
 So let's take the good times as they go 
 And I'll meet you further on up the road 
 Further on up the road 
 Further on up the road 
 Further on up the road 
 Further on up the road 
 One sunny morning we'll rise I know 
 And I'll meet you further on up the road 
 One sunny morning we'll rise I know 
 And I'll meet you further on up the road."
215,Bruce Springsteen,rock,The Fuse,"Down at the court house they're ringing the flag down 
 Long black line of cars snaking slow through town 
 Red sheets snapping on the line 
 With this ring will you be mine? 
 The fuse is burning 
 Shut out the lights 
 The fuse is burning 
 Come on, let me do you right 
 Trees on fire with the first fall's frost 
 Long black line in front of Holy Cross 
 Blood moon rising in a sky of black dust 
 Tell me baby, who do you trust? 
 The fuse is burning 
 Shut out the lights 
 The fuse is burning 
 Come on, let me do you right 
 Tires on the highway hissing, something's coming 
 You can feel the wires in the treetops humming 
 Devil's on the horizon line 
 Your kiss and I'm alive 
 Quiet afternoon in the empty house 
 On the edge of the bed you slip off your blouse 
 The room is burning with the noon sun 
 Your bittersweet taste on my tongue 
 The fuse is burning 
 Shut out the lights 
 The fuse is burning 
 Come on, let me do you right 
 The fuse is burning 
 Shut out the lights 
 The fuse is burning 
 Come on, let me do you right 
 The fuse is burning 
 The fuse is burning 
 The fuse is burning 
 The fuse is burning 
 The fuse is burning"
216,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Mary's Place,"I got seven pictures of Buddha, the prophet's on my tongue 
 Eleven angels of mercy sighin' over that black hole in the sun 
 My heart's dark but it's risin', I'm pullin' all the faith I can see 
 From that black hole on the horizon I hear your voice calling me 
 Let it rain, let it rain 
 Let it rain, let it rain 
 Let it rain, let it rain 
 Let it rain 
 Meet me at Mary's place, we're gonna have a party 
 Meet me at Mary's place, we're gonna have a party 
 Tell me how do we get this thing started? 
 Meet me at Mary's place 
 Familiar faces around me, laughter fills the air 
 Your loving grace surrounds me, everybody is here 
 Furniture's out on the front porch, music's up loud 
 I dream of you in my arms, I lose myself in the crowd 
 Let it rain, let it rain 
 Let it rain, let it rain 
 Let it rain, let it rain 
 Let it rain 
 Meet me at Mary's place, we're gonna have a party 
 Meet me at Mary's place, we're gonna have a party 
 Tell me how do you live broken-hearted? 
 Meet me at Mary's place 
 I got a picture of you in my locker, I keep it close to my heart 
 It's a light shining in my breast, leading me through the dark 
 Seven days, seven candles in my window lighting your way 
 Your favorite record's on the turntable, I drop the needle and pray 
 Turn it up 
 Band's countin' out midnight, turn it up 
 Floor's rumblin' loud, turn it up 
 Singer's callin' up daylight, turn it up 
 And waitin' for that shout from the crowd, turn it up 
 Waitin' for that shout from the crowd, turn it up 
 Waitin' for that shout from the crowd, turn it up 
 Waitin' for that shout from the crowd, turn it up 
 Waitin' for that shout from the crowd, turn it up 
 Waitin' for that shout from the crowd 
 Turn it up, turn it up

217,Bruce Springsteen,rock,You're Missing,"Shirts in the closet, shoes in the hall 
 Mama's in the kitchen, baby and all 
 Everything is everything, everything is everything 
 But you're missing 
 Coffee cups on the counter, jackets on the chair 
 Papers on the doorstep, but you're not there 
 Everything is everything, everything is everything 
 But you're missing 
 Pictures on the nightstand, TV's on in the den 
 Your house is waiting, your house is waiting 
 For you to walk in, for you to walk in 
 But you're missing, you're missing 
 You're missing 
 When I shut out the lights, you're missing 
 When I close my eyes, you're missing 
 When I see the sun rise, you're missing 
 Children are asking if it's alright 
 Will you be in our arms tonight? 
 Morning is morning, the evening falls I have 
 Too much room in my bed, too many phone calls 
 How's everything, everything? 
 Everything, everything 
 You're missing 
 You're missing 
 God's drifting in heaven, devil's in the mailbox 
 I got dust on my shoes, nothing but teardrops"
218,Bruce Springsteen,rock,The Rising,"Can't see nothin' in front of me 
 Can't see nothin' coming up behind 
 I make my way through this darkness 
 I can't feel nothing but this chain that binds me 
 Lost track of how far I've gone 
 How far I've gone, how high I've climbed 
 On my back's a sixty pound stone 
 On my shoulder a half mile of line 
 Come on up for the rising 
 Come on up, lay your hands in mine 
 Come on up for the rising 
 Come on up for the rising tonight 
 Left the house this morning 
 Bells ringing filled the air 
 I was wearin' the cross of my calling 
 On wheels of fire I come rollin' down here 
 Come on up for the rising 
 Come on up, lay your hands in mine 
 Come on up for the rising 
 Come on up for the rising tonight 
 Lalala... 
 There's spirits above and behind me 
 Faces gone black, eyes burnin' bright 
 May their precious blood bind me 
 Lord, as I stand before your fiery light 
 Lalala... 
 I see you, Mary, in the garden 
 In the garden of a thousand sighs 
 There's holy pictures of our children 
 Dancin' in a sky filled with light 
 May I feel your arms around me 
 May I feel your blood mixed with mine 
 A dream of life comes to me 
 Like a catfish dancing on the end of my line 
 Sky of blackness and sorrow (A dream of life) 
 Sky of love, sky of tears (A dream of life) 
 Sky of glory and sadness (A dream of life) 
 Sky of mercy, sky of fear (A dream of life) 
 Sky of memory and shadow (A dream of life) 
 Your burnin' wind fills my arms tonight (A dream of life) 
 Sky of longing and emptiness (A dream of life) 
 Sky of fullness, sky of blessed life 
 Come on up for the rising 
 Come on up, lay your hands in mine 
 Come on up for the rising 
 Come on up for the rising tonight 
 Lalala... 
 (Come on up for the rising 
 Come on up, lay your hands in mine 
 Come on up for the rising 
 Come on up for the rising tonight)"
219,Bruce Springsteen,rock,My City Of Ruins,"There's a blood red circle on the cold dark ground 
 And the rain is falling down 
 The church door's thrown open, I can hear the organ's song 
 But the congregation's gone 
 My city of ruins 
 My city of ruins 
 Now the sweet bells of mercy drift through the evening trees 
 Young men on the corner like scattered leaves 
 The boarded-up windows, the empty streets 
 While my brother's down on his knees 
 My city of ruins 
 My city of ruins 
 Come on, rise up 
 Come on, rise up 
 Come on, rise up 
 Come on, rise up 
 Come on, rise up 
 Come on, rise up 
 Come on, rise up 
 Come on, rise up 
 Now there's tears on the pillow, darlin' where we slept 
 You took my heart when you left 
 Without your sweet kiss, my soul is lost, my friend 
 Tell me how do I begin again? 
 My city's in ruins 
 My city's in ruins 
 Now with these hands 
 With these hands 
 With these hands 
 With these hands, I pray Lord 
 With these hands, with these hands 
 I pray for the strength, Lord 
 With these hands, with these hands 
 I pray for the faith, Lord 
 With these hands, with these hands 
 I pray for your love, Lord 
 With these hands, with these hands 
 I pray for your faith, Lord

220,Bruce Springsteen,rock,From Small Things (Big Things One Day Come),"At sixteen she quit high school to 
 Make her fortune in the promised land 
 She got a job behind the counter in an 
 All night hamburger stand 
 She wrote faithfully home to mama 
 ""Now mama don't you worry none"" 
 From small things, mama 
 Big things one day come 
 It was late one Friday he pulled in 
 Out of the dark 
 He was tall and handsome; first she 
 Took his order, then she took his heart 
 They bought a house up on the hillside 
 Where little feet soon would run 
 From small things, mama 
 Big things one day come 
 Oh but love is fleeting 
 It's sad but true 
 But when your heart is beating 
 You don't wanna hear the news 
 She packed her bags 
 And with a Wyomie County real estate man 
 She ran down to Tampa 
 In and ""El Dorado Grande"" 
 She wrote back home, ""Dear Mama 
 Life is just heaven in the sun 
 From small things, mama 
 Big things one day come"" 
 Well she shot him dead 
 On a sunny Florida road 
 When they caught her all she said 
 Was she couldn't stand the way he drove 
 Back home lonesome Johnny 
 Prays for his baby's parole 
 He waits on the hillside 
 Where the Wyomie waters roll 
 At his feet and almost grown now 
 A blue-eyed daughter and a handsome son 
 Well from small things, mama 
 Big things one day come 
 Well from small things, mama"

224,Bruce Springsteen,rock,None But The Brave,"Tonight down on Union Street 
 I'm thinking back baby to you and me 
 The way you used to be 
 Your words come back to me 
 From passing cars 
 Voices sing out 
 And empty bars 
 Where guitars ring out 
 We'd walk and talk about 
 Who'd be the ones to get out 
 You said 
 None but the brave 
 No one baby but the brave 
 Those strong enough to save 
 Something from what they gave. 
 None but the brave 
 No one baby but the brave 
 In my dreams these nights I see you my friend 
 The way you looked back then 
 On a night like this 
 I know that girl no longer exists 
 Except for a moment in some stranger's eyes 
 Or in the nameless girls in cars rushing by 
 That's where I find you tonight 
 And in my heart you still survive 
 None but the brave 
 No one baby but the brave 
 Those strong enough to save 
 Something from the love they gave. 
 None but the brave 
 No one baby but the brave 
 Now tonight once more 
 I search every face on that crowded floor 
 Looking for, I don't know what for 
 Just waitin' to see you come walkin' through that door 
 There's a girl standing by the band 
 She reminds me of you and I ask her to dance 
 As the drummer counts away 
 I take her hand, we move away 
 Tonight, now I see old friends 
 Caught in a game they've got no chance to win 
 Gettin' beat and then playin' again 
 'Til their strength gives out or their heart gives in 
 Now who's the man who thinks he can decide 
 Whose dreams will live and who's shall be pushed aside 
 Has he ever walked down these streets at night and looked into the eyes of 
 None but the brave 
 No one baby but the brave 
 Those strong enough to save 
 Something from the love they gave 
 None but the brave"
225,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Missing,"Woke up this morning, was a chill in the air 
 Went into the kitchen, your cigarettes were lying there 
 Your jacket hung on the chair where you left it last night 
 Everything was in place, everything was all right 
 But you were missing 
 Missing... 
 Last night I dreamed the sky went black 
 You were drifting down and you couldn't get back 
 You were lost and in trouble so far from home 
 I reached for you, my arms went to stone 
 I woke and you were missing 
 Missing... 
 I searched for something to explain 
 In the whispering rain, the trembling leaves 
 Tell me baby where did you go 
 You were here just a moment ago 
 There's nights I still hear your footsteps fall 
 Your key in the door, your voice in the hall 
 Your smell drifts through our bedroom 
 I lie awake, but I don't move 
 Missing..."

 Lift me up and I'll fall 
 With you lift me up 
 Let your love lift me up 
 I don't need your sacred vow 
 Or the promise tomorrow brings 
 There, behind the morning clouds 
 I'll take the faith the daylight brings 
 Lift me up, darling 
 Lift me up and I'll fall 
 With you lift me up 
 Let your love lift me up 
 When the morning bright 
 Lifts away this night 
 And the light above 
 We will find our love 
 We will find our love 
 Your skin, your hand upon my neck 
 This skin, your fingers on my skin 
 This kiss, this heartbeat, this breath 
 This heart, this heart, this wilderness 
 Lift me up, darling 
 Lift me up and I'll fall 
 With you lift me up 
 Let your love lift me up."

 And your braggin', how you wasn't even scared 
 Well baby you know I just love the sound 
 Of that pipe organ on the merry-go-round 
 Baby, down at the county fair 
 County fair, county fair, 
 Everybody in town'll be there 
 So come on, hey we're goin' down there 
 (Hey) Little girl with the long blond hair 
 Come win your daddy one of them stuffed bears 
 Baby, down at the country fair 
 At the north end of the field they set up a stand 
 And they got a little rock and roll band 
 People dancin' out in the open air 
 It's James Young and the Immortal Ones 
 Two guitars, (baby) bass and drums 
 Just rockin', down at the county fair 
 (Well) County fair, county fair 
 Everybody in town'll be there 
 So come on, we're goin' down there 
 Little girl with the long blond hair 
 Come win your daddy one of them stuffed bears 
 Baby, down at the county fair 
 Now it's getting late before we head back to town 
 We let that fortune wheel spin around 
 Come on mister tell me what's waiting out there 
 On my way out I steal a kiss in the dark 
 Hope I can remember where our car's parked 
 Baby, out at the county fair 
 Now off down the highway there's the last stream of cars 
 We sit a while in my front yard 
 With the radio playin' soft and low 
 I pull Carol close to my heart 
 And I lean back and stare up at the stars 
 Oh I wish, I'd never have to let this moment go"
229,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Code Of Silence,"There's a code of silence that we don't dare speak 
 There's a wall between us and the river's deep 
 We keep pretending that there's nothing wrong 
 But there's a code of silence and it can't go on 
 Is the truth so elusive, so elusive you see 
 That it ain't enough baby 
 To bridge the distance between you and me 
 There's a list of grievance 100 miles long 
 There's a code of silence and it can't go on 
 Well you walk with your eyes open 
 But your lips they remain sealed 
 While the promises we made are broken 
 Beneath the truth we fear to reveal 
 Now I need to know now darlin' 
 I need to know what's goin' on so c'mon 
 Well you walk with your eyes open 
 But your lips they remain sealed 
 While the promises we made are broken 
 Beneath the truth we fear to reveal 
 Now I need to know now darlin' 
 I need to know what's goin' on so c'mon 
 There's a code of silence that we don't dare speak 
 There's a wall between us and the river's deep 
 We keep pretending that there's nothing wrong"
230,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Dead Man Walkin',"There's a pale horse comin' 
 I'm gonna ride it 
 I'll rise in the morning 
 My fate decided 
 I'm a dead man walkin' 
 I'm a dead man walkin' 
 In St. James Parish 
 I was born and christened 
 Now I've got my story 
 Mister no need for you to listen 
 It's just a dead man talkin' 
 Once I had a job I had a girl 
 But between our dreams and actions 
 Lies this world 
 In the deep forest 
 Their blood and tears rushed over me 
 All I could feel was the drugs and the shotgun 
 And my fear up inside of me 
 Like a dead man talkin' 
 'Neath a summer sky my eyes went black 
 Sister I won't ask for forgiveness 
 My sins are all I have 
 Now the clouds above my prison 
 Move slowly across the sky 
 There's a new day dawnin' 
 And my dreams are full tonight..."
231,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Devils & Dust,"I got my finger on the trigger but I don't know who to trust 
 When I look into your eyes, there's just devils and dust 
 We're a long, long way from home, Bobbie, home's a long, long way from us 
 I feel a dirty wind blowing devils and dust 
 I got God on my side and I'm just trying to survive 
 What if what you do to survive kills the things you love? 
 Fear's a powerful thing, baby, it can turn your heart black, you can trust 
 It'll take your God-filled soul and fill it with devils and dust 
 Well I dreamed of you last night in a field of blood and stone 
 The blood began to dry, the smell began to rise 
 Well I dreamed of you last night, Bobbie, in a field of mud and bone 
 Your blood began to dry and the smell began to rise 
 We've got God on our side, we're just trying to survive 
 What if what you do to survive kills the things you love? 
 Fear's a powerful thing, it'll turn your heart black, you can trust 
 It'll take your God-filled soul, fill it with devils and dust 
 It'll take your God-filled soul, fill it with devils and dust 
 Now every woman and every man, they wanna take a righteous stand 
 Find the love that God wills and the faith that He commands 
 I've got my finger on the trigger and tonight faith just ain't enough 
 When I look inside my heart there's just devils and dust 
 Well I've got God on my side and I'm just trying to survive 
 What if what you do to survive kills the things you love? 
 Fear's a dangerous thing, it can turn your heart black, you can trust 
 It'll take your God filled soul, fill it with devils and dust 
 Yeah, it'll take your God-filled soul, fill it with devils and dust"
232,Bruce Springsteen,rock,All The Way Home,"I know what it's like to have failed, baby 
 With the whole world lookin' on 
 I know what it's like to have soared 
 And come crashin' like a drunk on a barroom floor 
 Now you got no reason to trust me 
 My confidence is a little rusty 
 But if you don't feel like bein' alone 
 Baby I could walk you all the way home 
 Well now our old fears and failures 
 Oh, baby they do linger 
 Like the shadow of that ring 
 That was on your finger 
 Those days they've come and gone 
 Baby I could walk you all the way home 
 Love leaves nothin' but shadows and vapor 
 We go on, as is our sad nature 
 Now it's some old Stones' song the band is trashin' 
 If you feel like dancin', baby I'm askin' 
 It's comin' on closing time 
 Bartender he's ringin' last call 
 These days I don't stand on pride 
 And I ain't afraid to take a fall 
 So if you're seein' what you like 
 Maybe your first choice, he's gone 
 Well that's all right 
 Baby, I could walk you all the way home 
 Baby, I could walk you all the way home"
233,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Reno,"She took off her stockings 
 I held 'em to my face 
 She had your ankles 
 I felt filled with grace 
 ""Two hundred dollars straight in 
 Two-fifty up the ass"" she smiled and said 
 She unbuckled my belt, pulled back her hair 
 And sat in front of me on the bed 
 She said, ""Honey, how's that feel 
 Do you want me to go slow?"" 
 My eyes drifted out the window 
 And down to the road below 
 I felt my stomach tighten 
 As the sun bloodied the sky 
 And sliced through hotel blinds 
 I closed my eyes 
 Sunlight on the Amatitlan 
 Sunlight streaming through your hair 
 In the Valle de dos Rios 
 The smell of mock orange filled the air 
 We rode with the vaqueros 
 Down into cool rivers of green 
 I was sure the work and the smile coming out 'neath your hat 
 Was all I'll ever need 
 Somehow all you ever need's 
 Never quite enough you know 
 You and I, Maria 
 We learned it's so 
 She slipped me out of her mouth 
 ""You're ready"", she said 
 She took off her bra and panties, wet her fingers, slipped it inside her 
 And crawled over me on the bed 
 She bought me another whiskey 
 Said ""here's to the best you ever had"" 
 We laughed and made a toast 
 It wasn't the best I ever had, not even close"
234,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Long Time Comin',"Out where the creek turn shallow and sandy 
 And the moon comes skimmin' away the stars 
 When the mesquite comes rushin' over the hilltops 
 Straight into my arms, straight into my arms 
 I'm ridin' hard carryin' a cache of roses 
 A fresh map that I made 
 Tonight I'm gonna get birth naked and bury my old soul 
 And dance on it's grave, and dance on it's grave 
 It's been a long time comin', my dear 
 It's been a long time comin' but now it's here 
 And now it's here 
 Well my daddy he was just a stranger 
 Lived in a hotel downtown 
 Well when I was a kid he was just somebody 
 Somebody I'd see around, somebody I'd see around 
 Well now down below and pullin' on my shirt 
 Yeah I got some kids of my own 
 If I had one wish for you in this god forsaken world, kid 
 It'd be that your mistakes will be your own, that your sins will be your own 
 It's been a long time comin', my dear 
 It's been a long time comin' but now it's here 
 And now it's here 
 Out 'neath the arms of Cassiopeia 
 Where the sword of Orion sweeps 
 It's me and you, Rosie, cracklin' like crossed wires 
 And you breathin' in your sleep, and you breathin' in your sleep 
 Well there's just a spark of a campfire left burnin' 
 Two kids in a sleeping bag beside 
 Reach 'neath your shirt, put my hands across your belly and feel 
 Another one kickin' inside, and I ain't gonna fuck it up this time 
 It's been a long time comin', my dear 
 It's been a long time comin' but now it's here 
 It's been a long time comin', my dear 
 It's been a long time comin' but now it's here"
235,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Black Cowboys,"Rainey William's playground was the Mott Haven streets 
 Where he ran past melted candles and flower wreaths 
 Names and photos of the young black faces 
 Whose death and blood consecrated these places 
 Rainey's mother said ""Rainey, stay at my side 
 For you are my blessing, you are my pride 
 It's your love here that keeps my soul alive 
 I want you to come home from school and stay inside"" 
 Rainey'd do his work and put his books away 
 There was a channel that showed a western movie everyday 
 Lynette brought him home books on the black cowboys of the Oklahoma range 
 And the Seminole scouts that fought the tribes of the Great Plains 
 Summer come and the days grew long 
 Rainey always had his mother's smile to depend on 
 Along a street of stray bullets, he made his way 
 To the warmth of her arms at the end of each day 
 Come the fall, the rain flooded these homes 
 In Ezekiel's valley of dry bones 
 It fell hard and dark to the ground 
 It fell without a sound 
 Lynette took up with a man whose business was the boulevard 
 Whose smile was fixed in a face that was never off guard 
 In the pipes 'neath the kitchen sink his secrets are kept 
 In the day, behind drawn curtains in Lynette's bedroom, he slept 
 Then she got lost in the days 
 The smile Rainey depended on dusted away 
 The arms that held him were no more his home 
 He lay at night his head pressed to her chest, listening to the ghost in her bones 
 In the kitchen Rainey slipped his hand between the pipes 
 From a brown bag pulled five hundred dollar bills and stuck it in his coat side 
 Stood in the dark at his mother's bed 
 Brushed her hair and kissed her eyes 
 In the twilight Rainey walked to the station on streets of stone 
 Through Pennsylvania and Ohio his train drifted on 
 Through the small towns of Indiana the big train crept 
 As he lay his head back on his seat and slept 
 He woke and the towns gave way to muddy fields of green 
 Corn and cotton and endless nothing in between 
 Over the rutted hills of Oklahoma the red sun slipped and was gone 
 The moon rose and stripped the earth to its bone"
236,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Maria's Bed,"Been on a barbed wire highway 40 days and nights 
 I ain't complainin', it's my job and it suits me right 
 I got a sweet soft fever rushin' 'round my head 
 I'm gonna sleep tonight in Maria's bed 
 Got on a dead man suit and smilin' skull ring 
 Lucky graveyard boots and a song to sing 
 I keep my heart in my work but trouble's in my head 
 And I keep my soul in Maria's bed 
 I been up on sugar mountain, 'cross the sweet blue seas 
 I walked the valley of love and tears and mystery 
 I got run outta luck and give myself up for dead 
 And I drank the cool clear waters from Maria's bed 
 She give me candy stick kisses 'neath a wolf dog moon 
 One sweet breath and she'll take you, mister, to the upper room 
 I was burned by the angels, sold wings of lead 
 Then I fell in the roses and sweet salvation of Maria's bed 
 I been out in the desert, yeah, doin' my time 
 Siftin' through the dust for fools gold, lookin' for a sign 
 Holy man said ""hold on brother, there's a light up ahead"" 
 Ain't nothing like a light that shines on me in Maria's bed 
 Well, I'll take my blessings at the river head 
 I'm living in the light of Maria's bed"
237,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Silver Palomino,"I was barely 13 years old 
 She came out of the Guadalupe's on a night so cold 
 Her coat was frosted diamonds in the sallow moon's glow 
 My silver palomino 
 Sixteen hands from her withers to the ground 
 I lie in bed and listen to the sound 
 Of the west Texas thunder roll 
 My silver palomino 
 I track her into the mountains she loved 
 Watch her from the rocks above 
 She'd dip her neck and drink from the winter flows 
 My silver palomino 
 Our mustañeros were the very best, sir 
 They could never lay a rope on her 
 No corral will ever hold 
 The silver palomino 
 In my dreams bareback I ride 
 Over the pradera low and wide 
 As the wind sweeps out the draw 
 'Cross the scrub desert floor 
 I'd give my riata and spurs 
 If I could be forever yours 
 I'd ride into the serrania where no one goes 
 For my silver palomino 
 Summer drought come hard that year 
 Our herd grazed the land so bare 
 Me and my dad had to blowtorch the thorns off the prickly pear 
 And mother, your hand slipped from my hair 
 Tonight I wake early the sky is pearl, the stars aglow 
 I saddle up my red roan 
 I ride deep into the mountains along a ridge of pale stone 
 Where the air is still with the coming snow 
 As I rise higher I can smell your hair 
 The scent of your skin, mother, fills the air 
 'Midst the harsh scrub pine that grows 
 I watch the silver palomino"
238,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Jesus Was An Only Son,"Well, Jesus was an only son 
 As he walked up Calvary Hill 
 His mother Mary walking beside him 
 In the path where his blood spilled 
 Jesus was an only son 
 In the hills of Nazareth 
 As he lay reading the Psalms of David 
 At his mother's feet 
 A mother prays, ""Sleep tight, my child, sleep well 
 For I'll be at your side 
 That no shadow, no darkness, no tolling bell 
 Shall pierce your dreams this night"" 
 In the garden at Gethsemane 
 He prayed for the life he'd never live 
 He beseeched his Heavenly Father 
 To remove the cup of death from his lips 
 Now there's a loss that can never be replaced 
 A destination that can never be reached 
 A light you'll never find in another's face 
 A sea whose distance cannot be breached 
 Well, Jesus kissed his mother's hands 
 Whispered, ""Mother, still your tears 
 For remember the soul of the universe 
 Willed a world and it appeared"""
239,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Leah,"I wanna build me a house 
 On higher ground 
 I wanna find me a world 
 Where love's the only sound 
 High above this road 
 Filled with shadow and doubt 
 I want to shoulder my load 
 And figure it all out with Leah 
 I walk this road 
 With a hammer and a fiery lantern 
 With this hand I've built 
 And with this I've burned 
 I wanna live in the same house 
 Beneath the same roof 
 Sleep in the same bed 
 Search for the same proof as Leah 
 I got somethin' in my heart 
 I been waitin' to give 
 I got a life I wanna start 
 One I been waitin' to live 
 No more waitin' 
 Tonight I feel the light I say the prayer 
 I open the door 
 I climb the stairs"
240,Bruce Springsteen,rock,The Hitter,"Come to the door, ma, and unlock the chain 
 Well, I was just passin' through and got caught in the rain 
 There's nothing that I want, nothing that you need say 
 Just let me lie down for a while and I'll be on my way 
 I was no more than a kid when you put me on the Southern Queen 
 With the police on my back, I fled to New Orleans 
 Well, I fought in the dockyards for the money that I made 
 I knew the fight was my home and blood was my trade 
 Baton Rouge, Ponchatoula, and Lafayette town 
 Well, they paid me their money, ma, I knocked the men down 
 I did what I did and it come easily 
 Restraint and mercy, ma, were always strangers to me 
 I fought champion Jack Thompson in a field full of mud 
 Rain poured through the tent to the canvas and mixed with our blood 
 In the twelfth, I slipped my tongue over my broken jaw 
 I stood over him, pounded his bloody body into the floor 
 Well, the bell rang and rang and still I kept on 
 'Til I felt my glove leather slip 'tween his skin and bone 
 And the women and the money came fast and the days, I lost track 
 The women red, the money green, but the numbers were black 
 I fought for the men in their silk suits to lay down their bets 
 Well, I took my good share, ma, I have no regrets 
 I took the fix at the state armory with John McDowell 
 From high in the rafters I watched myself fall 
 As they raised his arm, my stomach twisted and the sky it went black 
 I stuffed my bag with their good money and I never looked back 
 Understand, in the end, ma, every man plays the game 
 If you know me one different, then speak out his name 
 Ma, if my voice now you don't recognize 
 Well, just open the door and look into your dark eyes 
 I ask of you nothin', not a kiss not a smile 
 Just open the door and let me lie down for a while 
 Now the gray rain's fallin' and my ring fightin's done 
 So in the work fields and alleys, I take all who'll come 
 If you're a better man than me, then just step to the line 
 And show me your money and speak out your crime 
 Now there's nothin' I want, ma, nothin' that you need say 
 Just let me lie down for a while and I'll be on my way 
 Well, tonight in Stockyard, a man draws a circle in the dirt 
 I move to the center and take off my shirt 
 I study him for the cuts, the scars, the pain man nor time can erase 
 I move hard to the left and I strike to the face"
241,Bruce Springsteen,rock,All I'm Thinkin' About,"Blind man wavin' by the side of the road 
 In a flatbed Ford carryin' a heavy load 
 Sweet thing sipping on a blueberry wine 
 On a flat black highway down in Carolina 
 Blackbird slipping in a sky of blue, all I'm thinkin' about is you, baby 
 And all I'm thinkin' about is you, baby, all I'm thinkin' about is you 
 All I'm thinkin' about is you, baby, all I'm thinkin' about is you

 We hook him through the the lip and throw him off with a line 
 A sweet pair of legs got me feelin' so blue 
 And all I'm thinkin' about is you, baby, all I'm thinkin' about is you 
 All I'm thinkin' about is you, baby, all I'm thinkin' about is you

 Friday night and Daddy's shirt is torn

 Ain't nothing in this world I can do about it, all I'm thinkin' about is you 
 Field turned up, the seed is sowed 
 Rain comin' in from over across the road 
 Big black curtain comin' across the field 
 Blind will see and lame will be healed 
 Brown-eyed girl, turn my back on you, now it's lonely 
 All I'm thinkin' about is you, baby, all I'm thinkin' about is you 
 All I'm thinkin' about is you, baby, all I'm thinkin' about is you 
 Ain't nothing in this world can take away these blues, all I'm thinkin' about is you 
 All I'm thinkin' about is you, baby, all I'm thinkin' about is you 
 All I'm thinkin' about is you, baby, all I'm thinkin' about is you

242,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Matamoros Banks,"For two days the river keeps you down 
 Then you rise to the light without a sound 
 Past the playgrounds and empty switching yards 
 The turtles eat the skin from your eyes, so they lay open to the stars 
 Your clothes give way to the current and river stone 
 'Til every trace of who you ever were is gone 
 And the things of the earth they make their claim 
 That the things of heaven may do the same 
 Goodbye, my darling, for your love I give God thanks 
 Meet me on the Matamoros, meet me on the Matamoros, meet me on the Matamoros banks 
 Over rivers of stone and ancient ocean beds 
 I walk on twine and tire tread 
 My pockets full of dust, my mouth filled with cool stone 
 The pale moon opens the earth to its bones 
 I long, my darling, for your kiss 
 For your sweet love I give God thanks 
 The touch of your loving fingertips 
 Meet me on the Matamoros, meet me on the Matamoros, meet me on the Matamoros banks 
 Your sweet memory comes on the evenin' wind 
 I sleep and dream of holding you in my arms again 
 The lights of Brownsville, across the river shine 
 A shout rings out and into the silty red river I dive 
 I long, my darling, for your kiss 
 For your sweet love I give God thanks 
 A touch of your loving fingertips 
 Meet me on the Matamoros, meet me on the Matamoros, meet me on the Matamoros banks 
 Meet me on the Matamoros, meet me on the Matamoros, meet me on the Matamoros banks"

 Washed his face in a frying pan 
 Combed his hair with a wagon wheel 
 And died with a toothache in his heel 
 Get out the way! Old Dan Tucker, 
 You're too late to get your supper. 
 Get out the way! Old Dan Tucker, 
 You're too late to get your supper. 
 Old Dan Tucker, he'd come to town 
 Riding a billy goat, leading a hound 
 The hound dog barked, the billy goat jumped 
 Landed 'Ol Tucker on a stump! 
 Get out the way! Old Dan Tucker, 
 You're too late to get your supper 
 Get out the way! Old Dan Tucker, 
 You're too late to get your supper

246,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Jesse James,"Jesse James was a lad that killed many a man, 
 He robbed the Glendale train, 
 He stole from the rich and he gave to the poor, 
 He'd a hand and a heart and a brain. 
 Well it was Robert Ford, that dirty little coward, 
 I wonder now how he feels, 
 For he ate of Jesse's bread and he slept in Jesse's bed, 
 Then he laid poor Jesse in his grave. 
 Well Jesse had a wife to mourn for his life 
 Three children now they were brave 
 Well that dirty little coward that shot Mr. Howard 
 He laid poor Jesse in his grave 
 Jesse was a man, a friend to the poor, 
 He'd never rob a mother or a child 
 There never was a man with the law in his hand 
 That could take Jesse James alive 
 It was on a Saturday night and the moon was shining bright, 
 They robbed the Glendale train, 
 And people they did say o'er many miles away 
 It was those outlaws, Ther're Frank and Jesse James 
 Well Jesse had a wife to mourn for his life 
 Three children now they were brave 
 Well that dirty little coward that shot Mr. Howard 
 He laid poor Jesse in his grave 
 Now the people held their breath when they heard of Jesse's death, 
 And wondered how he ever came to fall 
 Robert Ford, It was a fact, he shot Jesse in the back 
 While Jesse hung a picture on the wall 
 Now Jesse went to rest with his hand on his breast, 
 The devil will be upon his knee. 
 He was born one day in the County Clay, 
 And he came from a solitary race. 
 Well Jesse had a wife to mourn for his life 
 Three children now they were brave 
 Well that dirty little coward that shot Mr. Howard 
 He laid poor Jesse in his grave"

252,Bruce Springsteen,rock,My Oklahoma Home,"When they opened up the strip I was young and full of zip, 
 I wanted some place to call my own 
 And so I made the race, and staked me out a place, 
 And settled down along the Cimarron 
 It blowed away, it blowed away, 
 My Oklahoma home, it blowed away 
 Well it looked so green and fair when I built my shanty there, 
 But my Oklahoma home, it blowed away 
 I planted wheat and oats, got some chickens and some shoats, 
 Aimed to have some ham and eggs to feed my face 
 Got a mule to pull the plow, got an old red muley cow 
 And I also got a fancy mortgage on the place 
 It blowed away, it blowed away, 
 All the crops I planted blowed away 
 Well you can't grow any grain if you ain't got any rain; 
 Everything except the mortgage blowed away 
 It looked so green and fair, when I built my shanty there, 
 I figured I was all set for life 
 I put on my Sunday best with my fancy scalloped vest 
 And went to town and picked me out a wife 
 She blowed away, she blowed away 
 My Oklahoma woman blowed away 
 Mister as I bent and kissed her, she was picked up by a twister; 
 My Oklahoma woman blowed away 
 Well then I was left alone a-listenin' to the moan 
 Of the wind around the corners of my shack; 
 So I took off down the road when the south wind blowed, 
 A-travelin' with the wind upon my back 
 I blowed away, I blowed away 
 Chasin that dust cloud up ahead 
 Once it looked so green and fair, now it's up there in the air; 
 My Oklahoma farm is overhead 
 Now I'm always close to home no matter where I roam, 
 For Oklahoma dust is everywhere 
 Makes no difference where I'm walkin', I can hear my chickens squawkin' 
 I can hear my wife a-talkin' in the air 
 It blowed away, it blowed away, 
 My Oklahoma home blowed away 
 But my home is always near; it's in the atmosphere, 
 My Oklahoma home that blowed away 
 Now I'm a roamin' Oklahoman, but I'm always close to home 
 And I'll never get homesick 'til I die 
 Cause no matter where I'm found, my home is all around; 
 My Oklahoma home is in the sky 
 It blowed away, it blowed away, 
 My farm down upon the Cimarron 
 Well now all around the world, wherever dust is whirled, 
 There's some from my Oklahoma home 
 It blowed away, it blowed away, 
 Yeah my Oklahoma home blowed away. 
 Yes it's up there in the sky in that dust cloud rolling by, my Oklahoma home is blowed away 
 Well its blowed away, it blowed away, 
 My Oklahoma home blowed away. 
 It's up there in the sky in that dust cloud rolling by, my Oklahoma home is in the sky"

 Above earth's lamentation. 
 I hear the real, though, far off hymn 
 That hails the new creation 
 What through the tempest loudly roars, 
 I hear the truth, it liveth. 
 What through the darkness round me close, 
 Songs in the night it giveth. 
 When tyrants tremble, sick with fear, 
 And hear their death-knell ringing, 
 When friends rejoice both far and near, 
 How can I keep from singing? 
 No storm can shake my inmost calm 
 While to that rock I'm clinging. 
 Since love is lord of Heaven and earth 
 How can I keep from singing?"

 What is this land of America, so many travel there 
 I'm going now while I'm still young, my darling meet me there 
 Wish me luck my lovely, I'll send for you when I can 
 And we'll make our home in the American land 
 Over there all the woman wear silk and satin to their knees 
 And children dear, the sweets, I hear, are growing on the trees 
 Gold comes rushing out the river straight into your hands 
 If you make your home in the American land 
 There's diamonds in the sidewalks, there's gutters lined in song 
 Dear, I hear that beer flows through the faucets all night long 
 There's treasure for the taking, for any hard working man 
 Who will make his home in the American land 
 I docked at Ellis Island in a city of light and spire 
 I wandered to the valley of red-hot steel and fire 
 We made the steel that built the cities with the sweat of our two hands 
 And I made my home in the American land 
 There's diamonds in the sidewalk, there's gutters lined in song 
 Dear I hear that beer flows through the faucets all night long 
 There's treasure for the taking, for any hard working man 
 Who will make his home in the American land

 The Blacks, the Irish, Italians, the Germans and the Jews 
 The Puerto Ricans, illegals, the Asians, Arabs miles from home 
 Come across the water with a fire down below 
 They died building the railroads, worked to bones and skin 
 They died in the fields and factories, names scattered in the wind 
 They died to get here a hundred years ago, they're dyin' now 
 The hands that built the country were always trying to keep down 
 There's diamonds in the sidewalk, there's gutters lined in song 
 Dear I hear that beer flows through the faucets all night long 
 There's treasure for the taking, for any hard working man 
 Who will make his home in the American land 
 Who will make his home in the American land 
 Who will make his home in the American land 
 (For all you travelers out there!)"
263,Bruce Springsteen,rock,When The Saints Go Marching In,"We are all trav'ling in the footsteps 
 Of those that've gone before 
 We'll all be reunited 
 On that new and sunlit shore 
 When the saints marching in 
 When the saints go marching in 
 Lord, how I want be in that number 
 When the saints go marching in 
 And when the sun refuses to shine 
 When the sun refuses to shine 
 Lord, how I want to be in that number 
 When the saints go marching in

 When the saints marching in 
 When the saints go marching in 
 Lord, how I want to be in that number 
 When the saints go marching in 
 And some say that this world of trouble 
 Is the only one we'll ever see 
 But I'm waiting for that morning 
 When the new world is revealed 
 Oh when the moon turns red with blood 
 Oh when the moon turns red with blood 
 Lord, how I want to be in that number 
 When the moon turns red with blood 
 When the saints (oh when the saints) go marching in (go marching in)

 Livin' on free food, tickets 
 Water in the milk from the hole in the roof 
 Where the rain came through 
 What can you do? hmm hmm 
 Tears from your little sister 
 Cryin' 'cause she don't have a dress without a patch 
 For the party to go 
 But she'll know she'll get by, 'cause she's 
 Livin' in the love of the common people 
 Smiles from the heart of the family man 
 Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to 
 Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can, as she can 
 It's a good thing you don't have a bus fare 
 It would fall through the hole in your pocket 
 And you'd lose it in the snow on the ground 
 Gonna be walking to town to find a job 
 Trying to keep your hands warm 
 When the hole in your shoe let the snow come through 
 And chills you to the bone 
 And you better go home where it's warm

266,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Radio Nowhere,"I was trying to find my way home 
 But all I heard was a drone 
 Bouncing off a satellite 
 Crushing the last long American night 
 This is radio nowhere 
 Is there anybody alive out there? 
 This is radio nowhere 
 Is there anybody alive out there? 
 I was staring at a dead dial 
 Just another lost number in a file 
 Dancing down a dark hole 
 Just searching for a world with some soul 
 This is radio nowhere 
 Is there anybody alive out there? 
 This is radio nowhere 
 Is there anybody alive out there? 
 Is there anybody alive out there? 
 I just want to hear some rhythm 
 I just want to hear some rhythm 
 I just want to hear some rhythm 
 I just want to hear some rhythm 
 I want a thousand guitars 
 I want pounding drums 
 I want a million different voices speaking in tongues 
 This is radio nowhere 
 Is there anybody alive out there? 
 This is radio nowhere 
 Is there anybody alive out there? 
 Is there anybody alive out there? 
 I was driving through the misty rain 
 And just searching for a mystery train 
 Bopping through the wild blue 
 Trying to make a connection with you 
 This is radio nowhere 
 Is there anybody alive out there? 
 This is radio nowhere 
 Is there anybody alive out there? 
 Is there anybody alive out there?

267,Bruce Springsteen,rock,You'll Be Comin' Down,"White roses and misty blue eyes 
 Red mornings, then nothin' but gray skies 
 A cup of coffee, a heart shot clean through 
 Jacket you bought me gone daisy gray-blue 
 You're smiling now, but you'll find out 
 They'll use you up and spit you out now 
 Your head's spinnin' in diamonds and clouds 
 But pretty soon it turns out 
 You'll be comin' down now, baby 
 You'll be comin' down 
 What goes around, it comes around and you'll be comin' down 
 Easy street, a quick buck and true lies 
 Smiles as thin as those dusky blue skies 
 A silver plate of pearls my golden child 
 It's all yours, at least for a little while 
 You'll be fine long as your pretty face holds out 
 Then it's gonna get pretty cold out 
 An empty stream of stars shooting by 
 You got your hopes on high 
 You'll be comin' down now, baby 
 You'll be comin' down 
 What goes around, it comes around and you'll be comin' down 
 For a while you'll go sparklin' by 
 Just another pretty thing on high 
 Like a thief on a Sunday morning 
 It all falls apart with no warning 
 Your cinnamon sky's gone candy-apple green 
 The crushed metal of your little flying machine 
 You'll be comin' down now baby 
 You'll be comin' down 
 What goes around, it comes around and you'll be comin' down 
 You'll be comin' down now baby 
 You'll be comin' down 
 What goes around, it comes around and you'll be comin' down"
268,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Livin' In The Future,"A letter come blowin' in on an ill wind 
 Somethin' 'bout me and you never seein' one another again 
 Yeah, well I knew it'd come, still I was struck deaf and dumb 
 Like when we kissed, that taste of blood on your tongue 
 Don't worry, darlin' 
 Now baby, don't you fret 
 We're livin' in the future and 
 None of this has happened yet 
 Don't worry, darlin' 
 Now baby, don't you fret 
 We're livin' in the future and 
 None of this has happened yet 
 Woke up Election Day, skies gunpowder and shades of gray 
 Beneath a dirty sun, I whistled my time away 
 Then just about sundown, you come walkin' through town 
 Your boot heels clickin' like the barrel of a pistol spinnin' 'round 
 Don't worry, darlin' 
 Now baby, don't you fret 
 We're livin' in the future and 
 None of this has happened yet 
 Don't worry, darlin' 
 Now baby, don't you fret 
 We're livin' in the future and 
 None of this has happened yet 
 The earth it gave away 
 The sea rose towards the sun 
 I opened up my heart to you 
 It got all damaged and undone 
 My ship Liberty sailed away on a bloody red horizon 
 The groundskeeper opened the gates and let the wild dogs run 
 I'm rollin' through town, a lost cowboy at sundown 
 Got my monkey on a leash, got my ear turned to the ground 
 My faith's been torn asunder, tell me is that rollin' thunder 
 Or just the sinkin' sound of somethin' righteous goin' under? 
 Don't worry, darlin' 
 Now baby, don't you fret 
 We're livin' in the future and 
 None of this has happened yet 
 Don't worry, darlin' 
 Now baby, don't you fret 
 We're livin' in the future and 
 None of this has happened yet 
 None of this has happened yet 
 None of this has happened yet 
 None of this has happened yet 
 None of this has happened yet"
269,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Your Own Worst Enemy,"You can't sleep at night 
 You can't dream your dream 
 Your fingerprints on file 
 Left clumsily at the scene 
 Your own worst enemy has come to town 
 Your own worst enemy has come to town 
 Yesterday the people were at ease 
 Baby slept in peace 
 You closed your eyes and saw her 
 You knew who you were 
 Now your own worst enemy has come to town 
 Your own worst enemy has come 
 Your world keeps turnin' 'round and 'round 
 But everything is upside down 
 Your own worst enemy has come to town 
 There's a face you know 
 Staring back from the shop window 
 The condition you're in 
 Now you just can't get out of this skin 
 The times they got too clear 
 So you removed all the mirrors 
 Once the family felt secure 
 Now no one's very sure 
 Your own worst enemy has come to town 
 Your own worst enemy has come 
 Everything is falling down 
 Your own worst enemy has come to town 
 Your own worst enemy has come 
 Everything is falling down 
 Your own worst enemy has come to town 
 Your flag it flew so high 
 It drifted into the sky"
270,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Gypsy Biker,"The speculators made their money on the blood you shed 
 Your momma's pulled the sheets up off your bed 
 Profiteers on Jhames Street sold your shoes and clothes 
 Ain't nobody talkin' because everybody knows 
 We pulled your cycle up back the garage and polished up the chrome* 
 Our gypsy biker coming home 
 Sister Mary sits with your colors, but Johnny's drunk and gone 
 This old town's been rousted, which side you on? 
 They would march up over the hill, this old fools parade 
 Shouting victory for the righteous for you must hear the grace 
 Ain't nobody talkin', but just waiting on the phone 
 Gypsy biker coming home 
 Whoa! 
 We rode into the foothills, Bobby brought the gasoline 
 We stood around the circle as she lit up the ravine 
 The spring hot desert wind rushed down on us all the way back home 
 To the dead, well it don't matter much 'bout who's wrong or right 
 You asked me that question, I didn't get it right 
 You slipped into your darkness, now all that remains 
 Is my love for you brother, life's still unchanged 
 To him that threw you away, you ain't nothing but gone 
 My gypsy biker's coming home 
 And now I'm out countin' white lines 
 Countin' white lines and getting stoned 
 My gypsy biker's coming home 
 Whoa!

 Down on Blessing Avenue 
 Lovers they walk by 
 Holdin' hands two by two 
 A breeze crosses the porch 
 Bicycle spokes spin 'round 
 Jacket's on, I'm out the door 
 Tonight I'm gonna burn this town down 
 And the girls in their summer clothes 
 In the cool of the evening light 
 The girls in their summer clothes 
 Pass me by 
 Kid's rubber ball smacks 
 Off the gutter 'neath the lamp light 
 Big bank clock chimes 
 Off go the sleepy front porch lights 
 Downtown the store's alive 
 As the evening's underway 
 Things been a little tight 
 But I know they're gonna turn my way 
 And the girls in their summer clothes 
 In the cool of the evening light 
 The girls in their summer clothes 
 Pass me by 
 Frankie's Diner's 
 Over on the edge of town 
 Neon sign spinnin' round 
 Like a cross over the lost and found 
 Fluorescent lights 
 Flicker above Bob's Grill 
 Shaniqua brings a coffee and asks ""fill?"" 
 And says ""penny for your thoughts now my boy Bill"" 
 She went away 
 She cut me like a knife 
 Hello beautiful thing 
 Maybe you could save my life 
 In just a glance 
 Down here on Magic Street 
 Love's a fool's dance 
 I ain't got much sense but I still got my feet 
 And the girls in their summer clothes 
 In the cool of the evening light 
 The girls in their summer clothes 
 Pass me by 
 And the girls in their summer clothes 
 In the cool of the evening light 
 The girls in their summer clothes 
 Pass me by

272,Bruce Springsteen,rock,I'll Work For Your Love,"Pour me a drink Theresa 
 In one of those glasses you dust off 
 And I'll watch the bones in your back 
 Like the stations of the cross 
 'Round your hair the sun lifts a halo 
 At your lips a crown of thorns 
 Whatever other deals goin' down 
 To this one I'm sworn 
 I'll work for your love, dear 
 I'll work for your love 
 What others may want for free 
 I'll work for your love 
 The dust of civilizations 
 And loves sweet remains 
 Slip off of your fingers 
 And come driftin' down like rain 
 The pages of Revelation 
 Lie open in your empty eyes of blue 
 I watch you slip that comb through your hair and this I promise you 
 I'll work for your love, dear 
 I'll work for your love 
 What others may want for free 
 I'll work for your love 
 Your tears, they fill the rosary 
 At your feet, my temple of bones 
 Here in this perdition we go on and on 
 Now our city of peace has crumbled 
 Our book of faith's been tossed 
 And I'm just out here searchin' 
 For my own piece of the cross 
 The late afternoon sun fills the room 
 With the mist of the garden before the fall I watch your hands smooth the front of your blouse and seven drops of blood fall 
 I'll work for your love, dear 
 I'll work for your love 
 What others may want for free 
 I'll work for your... 
 What others may want for free 
 I'll work for your... 
 What others may want for free 
 I'll work for your love"

 I can make it disappear 
 I got a card up my sleeve 
 Name it and I'll pull it out your ear 
 I got a rabbit in my hat 
 If you wanna come and see 
 This is what we'll be 
 This is what we'll be 
 I got shackles on my wrists 
 Soon I'll slip 'em and be gone 
 Chain me in a box in the river 
 And I'll rise singin' this song 
 Trust none of what you hear 
 And less of what you see 
 This is what we'll be 
 This is what we'll be 
 I got a shiny saw blade 
 All I need's a volunteer 
 I'll cut you in half 
 While you're smilin' ear to ear 
 And the freedom that you sought's 
 Drifting like a ghost amongst the trees 
 This is what we'll be 
 This is what we'll be 
 Now there's a fire down below 
 But it's coming up here 
 So leave everything you know 
 Carry only what you fear 
 On the road the sun is sinkin' low 
 There's bodies hangin' in the trees 
 This is what we'll be 
 This is what we'll be"
274,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Last To Die,"We took the highway till the road went black 
 We marked Truth Or Consequences on our map* 
 A voice drifted up from the radio 
 We saw the voice from long ago 
 Who'll be the last to die for a mistake 
 The last to die for a mistake 
 Whose blood will spill, whose heart will break 
 Who'll be the last to die for a mistake 
 The kids asleep in the backseat 
 We're just countin' the miles you and me 
 We don't measure the blood we've drawn anymore 
 We just stack the bodies outside the door 
 Who'll be the last to die for a mistake 
 The last to die for a mistake 
 Whose blood will spill, whose heart will break 
 Who'll be the last to die for a mistake 
 The wise men were all fools 
 What to do 
 The sun sets in flames as the city burns 
 Another day gone down as the night turns 
 And I hold you here in my heart 
 As things fall apart 
 A downtown window flushed with light 
 Faces of the dead at five (faces of the dead at five) 
 A martyr's silent eyes 
 Petition the drivers as we pass by 
 Who'll be the last to die for a mistake 
 The last to die for a mistake 
 Whose blood will spill, whose heart will break 
 Who'll be the last to die 
 Who'll be the last to die for a mistake 
 The last to die for a mistake 
 Darlin' your tyrants and kings form the same fate 
 Strung up at your city gates 
 And you're the last to die for a mistake"
275,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Long Walk Home,"Last night I stood at your doorstep 
 Trying to figure out what went wrong 
 You just slipped something into my palm and you were gone 
 I could smell the same deep green of summer 
 'Bove me the same night sky was glowin' 
 In the distance I could see the town where I was born 
 It's gonna be a long walk home 
 Hey pretty darling, don't wait up for me 
 Gonna be a long walk home 
 A long walk home 
 In town I pass Sal's grocery 
 Barber shop on South Street 
 I looked in their faces 
 They're all rank strangers to me 
 Well, Veteran's Hall high upon the hill 
 Stood silent and alone 
 The diner was shuttered and boarded 
 With a sign that just said ""gone"" 
 It's gonna be a long walk home 
 Hey pretty darling, don't wait up for me 
 Gonna be a long walk home 
 Hey pretty darling, don't wait up for me 
 Gonna be a long walk home 
 It's gonna be a long walk home 
 Here everybody has a neighbor 
 Everybody has a friend 
 Everybody has a reason to begin again 
 My father said ""Son, we're lucky in this town 
 It's a beautiful place to be born 
 It just wraps its arms around you 
 Nobody crowds you and nobody goes it alone"" 
 ""Your flag flyin' over the courthouse 
 Means certain things are set in stone 
 Who we are, what we'll do, and what we won't"" 
 It's gonna be a long walk home 
 Hey pretty darling, don't wait up for me 
 Gonna be a long walk home 
 Hey pretty darling, don't wait up for me 
 Gonna be a long walk home 
 It's gonna be a long walk home 
 It's gonna be a long walk home 
 Hey pretty darling, don't wait up for me 
 Gonna be a long walk home 
 Hey pretty darling, don't wait up for me

 It's gonna be a long walk home"
276,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Devil's Arcade,"Remember the morning we dug up your gun 
 The worms in the barrel, the hanging sun 
 Those first nervous evenings of perfume and gin 
 The lost smell on your breath as I helped you get it in 
 The rush of your lips, the feel of your name 
 The beat in your heart, the devil's arcade 
 You said ""Heroes are needed, so heroes get made"" 
 Somebody made a bet, somebody paid 
 The cool desert morning and nothing to save 
 Just metal and plastic where your body caved 
 The slow games of poker with Lieutenant Ray 
 In the ward with the blue walls, a sea with no name 
 Where you lie adrift with the heroes of the devil's arcade 
 You sleep and you dream, your buddies Charlie and James 
 And wake with a thick desert dust on your skin 
 Voice says ""don't worry, I'm here 
 Just whisper the word tomorrow in my ear"" 
 House on a quiet street, a home for the brave 
 A glorious kingdom with the sun on your face 
 Rising from a long night as dark as the grave 
 On a thin chain of next moments and something like faith 
 On a morning to order a breakfast to make 
 A bed draped in sunshine, a body that waits 
 For the touch of your fingers, the end of the day 
 The beat of your heart, the beat of your heart 
 The beat of your heart, the beat of your heart 
 The beat of your heart, the beat of her heart 
 The beat of your heart, the slow burning away 
 Of the bitter fires of the devil's arcade"
277,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Terry's Song,"Well they built the Titanic to be one of a kind, but many ships have ruled the seas 
 They built the Eiffel Tower to stand alone, but they could build another if they please 
 Taj Mahal, the pyramids of Egypt, are unique I suppose 
 But when they built you, brother, they broke the mold 
 Now the world is filled with many wonders under the passing sun 
 And sometimes something comes along and you know it's for sure the only one 
 The Mona Lisa, the David, the Sistine Chapel, Jesus, Mary, and Joe 
 And when they built you, brother, they broke the mold 
 When they built you, brother, they turned dust into gold 
 When they built you, brother, they broke the mold 
 They say you can't take it with you, but I think that they're wrong 
 'Cause all I know is I woke up this morning, and something big was gone 
 Gone into that dark ether where you're still young and hard and cold 
 Just like when they built you, brother, they broke the mold 
 Now your death is upon us and we'll return your ashes to the earth 
 And I know you'll take comfort in knowing you've been roundly blessed and cursed 
 But love is a power greater than death, just like the songs and stories told 
 And when she built you, brother, she broke the mold 
 That attitude's a power stronger than death, alive and burning her stone cold 
 When they built you, brother"

 A time to kill, a time to heal 
 A time to laugh, a time to weep 
 To everything 
 Turn, Turn, Turn 
 There is a season 
 Turn, Turn, Turn 
 And a time for every purpose, under Heaven 
 A time to build up, a time to break down 
 A time to dance, a time to mourn 
 A time to cast away stones 
 A time to gather stones together 
 To everything 
 Turn, Turn, Turn 
 There is a season 
 Turn, Turn, Turn 
 And a time for every purpose, under Heaven 
 A time of love, a time of hate 
 A time of war, a time of peace 
 A time you may embrace 
 A time to refrain from embracing 
 To everything 
 Turn, Turn, Turn 
 There is a season 
 Turn, Turn, Turn 
 And a time for every purpose, under Heaven 
 A time to gain 
 A time to lose 
 A time to rend 
 A time to sew 
 A time to love 
 A time to hate 
 A time for peace, I swear it's not too late"
280,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Outlaw Pete,"He was born a little baby on the Appalachian Trail 
 At six months old he'd done three months in jail 
 He robbed a bank in his diapers and his little bare baby feet 
 All he said was, ""Folks, my name is Outlaw Pete 
 ""I'm Outlaw Pete, 
 ""I'm Outlaw Pete, 
 ""Can you hear me?"" 
 At 25 a Mustang pony he did steal 
 And he rode around and 'round on Heaven's wheel 
 ""Father Jesus, I'm an outlaw, killer and a thief 
 ""And I slow down only to sow my grief. 
 ""I'm Outlaw Pete, 
 ""I'm Outlaw Pete, 
 ""Can you hear me?"" 
 He cut his trail of tears across the countryside 
 And where he went, women wept and men died 
 One night he awoke from a vision of his own death 
 Saddled his pony and rode out deep into the west 
 Met a Navajo girl and settled down on the res' 
 And as the smoke fell, he held that beautiful daughter to his chest 
 ""I'm Outlaw Pete, 
 ""I'm Outlaw Pete, 
 ""Can you hear me? 
 ""Can you hear me? 
 ""Can you hear me?"" 
 Out of the east on an Irish stallion came Bounty Hunter Dan, 
 His heart quickened and burdened by the need to get his man. 
 He found Pete peaceful and fishing by the river, pulled his gun and got the drop. 
 He said, ""Pete, you think you've changed, but you have not."" 
 He cocked his pistol, pulled the trigger, and shouted, ""Let it stop!"" 
 He drew a knife from his boot, threw it and pierced Dan through the heart. 
 Dan smiled as he lay in his own blood dying in the sun. 
 Whispered in Pete's ear, ""We cannot undo these things we've done. 
 ""You're Outlaw Pete, 
 ""You're Outlaw Pete, 
 ""Can you hear me? 
 ""Can you hear me?"" 
 For 40 days and nights Pete rode and did not stop 
 Till he sat high upon an icy mountaintop. 
 He watched a hawk on a desert updraft slip and slide. 
 Moved to the edge and dug his spurs deep into his pony's side. 
 Some say Pete and his pony vanished over the edge. 
 Some say they remain frozen high upon that icy ledge. 
 A young Navajo girl washes in the river, skin so fair 
 And braids a piece of Pete's buckskin chaps into her hair. 
 ""Outlaw Pete 
 ""Outlaw Pete 
 ""Can you hear me? 
 ""Can you hear me? 
 ""Can you hear me? 
 ""Can you hear me? 
 ""Can you hear me? 
 ""Can you hear me? 
 ""Can you hear me? 
 ""Can you hear me? 
 ""Can you hear me? 
 ""Can you hear me? 
 ""Can you hear me? 
 ""Can you hear me?"""
281,Bruce Springsteen,rock,My Lucky Day,"In the room where fortune falls 
 On a day when chance is all 
 In the dark of fierce exile 
 I felt the grace of your smile 
 Honey, you're my lucky day 
 Baby, you're my lucky day 
 Well I lost all the other bets I made 
 Honey, you're my lucky day 
 When I see strong hearts give way 
 To the burdens of the day 
 To the weary hands of time 
 Where fortune is not kind 
 Honey, you're my lucky day 
 Baby, you're my lucky day 
 Well I lost all the other bets I made 
 Honey, you're my lucky day 
 Whoa! 
 I've waited at your side 
 I've carried the tears you've cried 
 But to win, darlin' we must play 
 So don't hide your heart away

 Well I lost all the other bets I made

282,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Working On A Dream,"Out here the nights are long, the days are lonely 
 I think of you and I'm working on a dream 
 I'm working on a dream 
 Now the cards I've drawn's a rough hand, darling 
 I straighten the back and I'm working on a dream 
 I'm working on a dream 
 I'm working on a dream 
 Though sometimes it feels so far away 
 I'm working on a dream 
 And I know it will be mine someday 
 Rain pourin' down, I swing my hammer 
 My hands are rough from working on a dream 
 I'm working on a dream 
 I'm working on a dream 
 Though trouble can feel like it's here to stay 
 I'm working on a dream 
 Well our love will chase trouble away 
 (Whistling interlude) 
 I'm working on a dream 
 Though it can feel so far away 
 I'm working on a dream 
 Our love will make it real someday 
 The sun rise come up, I climb the ladder 
 The new day breaks and I'm working on a dream 
 I'm working on a dream 
 I'm working on a dream 
 I'm working on a dream 
 I'm working on a dream 
 Though it can feel so far away 
 I'm working on a dream 
 Our love will make it real someday 
 I'm working on a dream 
 Though it can feel so far away 
 I'm working on a dream 
 And our love will make it real someday 
 I'm working on a dream 
 Though it can feel so far away 
 I'm working on a dream 
 Our love will make it real someday

283,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Queen Of The Supermarket,"There's a wonderful world where all you desire 
 And everything you've longed for is at your fingertips, 
 Where the bittersweet taste of life is at your lips, 
 Where aisles and aisles of dreams await you, 
 The cool promise of ecstasy fills the air. 
 At the end of each working day she's waiting there. 
 I'm in love with the queen of the supermarket. 
 As the evening sky turns blue, 
 A dream awaits in aisle number two. 
 With my shopping cart I move through the heart 
 Of a sea of fools so blissfully unaware 
 That they're in the presence of something wonderful and rare. 
 The way she moves behind the counter. 
 Beneath her white apron her secrets remain hers. 
 As she bag the groceries, her eyes so bored and sure she's unobserved. 
 I'm in love with the queen of the supermarket. 
 There's nothing I can say. 
 Each night I take my groceries 
 And I drift away. 
 And I drift away. 
 Guidance from the gods above. 
 At night I pray for the strength to tell her 
 Why I love, I love, I love, I love her so. 
 Take my place in the checkout line 
 Till one moment, her eyes meet mine 
 And lift it up, lift it up, lift it up, lift it up. 
 I'm in love with the queen of the supermarket. 
 Though a company cap covers her hair, 
 Nothing can hide the beauty waiting there 
 The beauty waiting there. 
 I'm in love with the queen of the supermarket. 
 I'm in love with the queen of the supermarket. 
 As I lift my groceries into my car 
 I turn back for a moment and catch a smile 
 That blows this whole fuckin' place apart. 
 I'm in love with the queen of the supermarket. 
 I'm in love with the queen of the supermarket. 
 I'm in love with the queen of the supermarket."
284,Bruce Springsteen,rock,What Love Can Do,"There's a pillar in the temple where I carved your name 
 There's a soul sitting sad and blue 
 Now the remedies you've taken are all in vain 
 Let me show you what love can do 
 Let me show you what love can do 
 Darling I can't stop the rain 
 Or turn your black sky blue 
 Well let me show you what love can do 
 Let me show you what love can do 
 Well now our truth lay shattered, we stood at world's end 
 There's a dead sun rose in view 
 As if any of this matters, a kiss my friend 
 Let me show you what love can do 
 Let me show you what love can do 
 Darling we can't stop this train 
 When it comes crashing through 
 But let me show you what love can do 
 Let me show you what love can do 
 On the bench you lie all is nails and rust 
 And the love you've given's turned ashes and dust 
 When the hope you've gathered's drifted to the wind 
 It's you and I now, friend (you and I now, friend) 
 You and I now, friend 
 Here our memory lay corrupted and our city lay dry 
 Let me make this vow to you 
 Here where it's blood for blood and an eye for an eye 
 Let me show you what love can do 
 Let me show you what love can do 
 Here we bear the mark of Cain 
 But let the light shine through 
 Let me show you what love can do 
 Let me show you what love can do 
 Let me show you what love can do 
 Let me show you what love can do"
285,Bruce Springsteen,rock,This Life,"A bang then stardust in your eyes 
 A billion years for just this night 
 In a way it will be alright 
 A blackness then the light of a million stars 
 As you slip into in my car 
 The evening sky strikes sparks 
 This life, this life and then the next 
 With you I have been blessed 
 What more can you expect 
 At night at my telescope alone 
 This emptiness I've roamed 
 Searching for a home 
 The stars, a brief string of shining charms 
 Rushing in right out of our arms 
 Into the drifting dark 
 This life, this life and then the next 
 With you I have been blessed 
 What more can you expect 
 This life, this life and then the next 
 I finger the hem of your dress 
 My universe at rest 
 We reach for starlight all night long 
 But gravity is too strong 
 Chained to this earth we go on and on and on and on and on 
 Then a million sighs cresting were you stood 
 A beauty in the neighborhood 
 This lonely planet never looked so good 
 This life, this life and then the next 
 With you I have been blessed 
 What more can you expect 
 This life, this life and then the next 
 I finger the hem of your dress 
 My universe at rest"
286,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Good Eye,"Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! 
 I was standing by the river 
 Where the cold black water runs 
 I was standing by the river 
 Where the cold black water runs 
 I had my good eye to the dark 
 And my blind eye to the sun 
 I had all of the riches 
 I had each and every one 
 I had all of the riches 
 I had each and every one 
 I had my good eye to the dark 
 And my blind eye to the sun 
 Well I swore you were my darling 
 Yeah, you were the only one 
 Since I swore you were my darling 
 You were the only one 
 Had my good eye to the dark 
 And my blind eye to the sun 
 Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!"
287,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Tomorrow Never Knows,"Where the cold wind blows 
 Tomorrow never knows 
 Where your sweet smile goes 
 Tomorrow never knows 
 You and me we've been standing here, my dear 
 Waiting for that time to come 
 Where the green grass grows 
 Tomorrow never knows 
 In the field your long hair flows 
 Down by the tail end of the tracks 
 Beneath the water tower 
 I carried you on my back 
 Over the rusted spikes of that highway of steel 
 When no more thunder sounds 
 Where the turn goes 
 Tomorrow never knows 
 Well he who waits for the day's riches will be lost 
 In the whispering tide 
 Where the river flows 
 Tomorrow never knows"
288,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Life Itself,"We met down in the valley, where the wine of love and destruction flows 
 There in that curve of darkness where flowers of temptation grow 
 I left the rest for the others it was you and nothing else 
 You felt so good to me baby, as good as life itself 
 You were life itself, rushing over me 
 Life itself, the wind in the black elms 
 Life itself, in your heart and in your eyes 
 I can't make it without you 
 I knew you were in trouble, anyone could tell 
 You carried your little black book from which all your secrets fell 
 You squandered all your riches, your love, your beauty and your wealth 
 Like you had no further use for, for life itself 
 You were life itself, rushing over me 
 Life itself, the wind in the black elms 
 Life itself, in your heart and in your eyes 
 I can't make it without you 
 Why the things that we treasure most slip away in time 
 'Til to the music we grow deaf and to god's beauty blind 
 Why do the things that connect us slowly pull us apart 
 'Til we fall away in our own darkness, stranger to our own hearts 
 And to life itself, rushing over me 
 Life itself, the wind in the black elms 
 Life itself, in your heart and in your eyes 
 I can't make it without you 
 So here's one for the road 
 Here's one to your health 
 And to life itself, rushing over me 
 Life itself, the wind in the black elms 
 Life itself, in your heart and in your eyes 
 I can't make it without you 
 Life itself 
 Life itself 
 Life itself 
 Life itself"
289,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Kingdom Of Days,"With you I don't hear the minutes ticking by 
 I don't feel the hours as they fly 
 I don't see the summer as it wanes 
 Just a subtle change of light upon your face 
 Walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away 
 This is our kingdom of days 
 I watched the sun as it rises and sets 
 I watched the moon trace its arc with no regret 
 My jacket 'round your shoulders, the falling leaves 
 The wet grass on our backs as the autumn breeze drifts through the trees 
 Walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away 
 This is our kingdom of days 
 This is our kingdom of days 
 I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I do 
 You whisper ""Then prove it, then prove it, then prove it, to me baby."" 
 When I count my blessings and you're mine for always 
 We laughed beneath the covers 
 And count the wrinkles and the grays 
 Sing away, sing away, sing away, sing away 
 Sing away, sing away, my darling, we'll sing away 
 This is our kingdom of days 
 This is our kingdom of days 
 This is our kingdom of days 
 This is our kingdom of days 
 This is our kingdom of days"

 They're taking all the tents down. 
 Where have you gone my handsome Billy? 
 Sundown, sundown. 
 The carnival trains leave town 
 Where are you now darling Billy? 
 We won't be dancing together on the high wire 
 Facing the lions with you at my side anymore. 
 We won't be breathing the smoke and the fire 
 On the midway. 
 Hanging from the trapeze, 
 My wrists waiting for your wrists. 
 Two daredevils high upon the wall of death. 
 You throw the knife, it lands inches from my heart. 
 Sundown. 
 Moonrise, moonrise 
 The light that was in your eyes is gone. 
 Daybreak, daybreak 
 The thing in you that made me ache is gone 
 We'll be riding the train without you tonight 
 The train that keeps on moving, 
 Its black smoke scorching the evening sky. 
 Millions of stars shining above us like every soul living and dead 
 It's been gathered together by God 
 To sing a hymn over your bones 
 Sundown, sundown 
 Empty are the fairgrounds 
 Where are you now handsome Billy?"

 Outside the Seven-Eleven store

 And he rides with me from town to town 
 We only run for the money got no strings attached 
 We shut 'em up and we shut 'em down 
 Tonight tonight the strips just right 
 I wanna blow 'em all out of their seats 
 Well come on out around the world 
 We're goin' racin' in the street 
 Well we take all the action we can meet 
 And we cover all the northeast states 
 And when the strip shuts down we run 'em in the street 
 From the back roads to the turnpike gates 
 Well now some guys they do it for the money 
 Other guys do it 'cause they don't know what else they can do 
 Well and they just hang around in an empty home 
 Waking up in a world that somebody else owns 
 And tonight tonight the strip's just right 
 I wanna blow 'em off in my first heat 
 Well now summer's here and the time is right 
 For racin' in the street 
 Well I met her on the strip three years ago 
 In a Camaro with this dude from L.A. 
 And I blew that Camaro off my back 
 And I stole that little girl away 
 But now there wrinkles round my baby's eyes 
 And she cries herself to sleep at night 
 And when I come home the house is dark 
 She sighs ""hey baby did you make it all right?"" 
 She sits on the porch of her daddy's house 
 Oh but honey your pretty dress is torn 
 She stared off alone into the night 
 With the eyes of one who hates for just being born 
 For all the blown-off strangers and hot rod angels 
 Stumbling through this promised land 
 Tonight my baby and me we're gonna ride to the sea 
 And wash these sins off our hands 
 Tonight tonight the strip's just right 
 I wanna blow 'em off in my first heat

 But we were walking on the wild side, running down a one way street. 
 In the night, I see only ... the fire in your eyes 
 The morning light brings the shadows of your lies 
 And so the change has come today 
 And for our wrongs, well, we must pay 
 We were walking on the wild side, running down a one way street. 
 Oh, my darling, I must, I must confess 
 This can't be love, no, I am just a man possessed

 You got the look and you own your world 
 But here you better check your diamonds and your pearls

 Come here, pretty baby, and rest your head upon my shoulder. 
 Just one kiss and we started 
 Now don't leave me to the brokenhearted, the brokenhearted, the brokenhearted 
 And tell me that you need me. 
 Well, now baby, the lonely nights keep growing longer 
 And my love for you just keeps growing stronger 
 Like a wheel of chance so endlessly turning 
 My fate lay in your hands, my heart forever burning. 
 In a sweet fire your kiss started 
 Now don't leave me to the brokenhearted, the brokenhearted, the brokenhearted 
 And tell me that you love me 
 Tell me that you want me, girl. 
 The cruel mistakes I've made, the hard price that I've paid 
 For the good times and for laughter 
 Girl, I should've known for the indifference that I've shown 
 I'd pay forever after. 
 And, darling, now all I'm trying to say is passion 
 And, love, they have a way of slipping into blackness 
 Uncared for of slipping away 
 The deck is cut, the cards turned, the hand is played 
 And all we ever hope for, burns to ashes and drifts away. 
 Now don't let our love slip into this darkness 
 Don't leave me to the brokenhearted, the brokenhearted, the brokenhearted 
 And tell me that you love me 
 Tell me that you need me 
 Tell me that you love me 
 Tell me that you want me 
 Tell me that you need me 
 Tell me that you want me 
 Tell me that you love me 
 Yeah, tell me that you love me 
 Tell me that you love me 
 Tell me that you want me 
 And come on now, darling 
 Say it right now, baby 
 Say it right now, darling 
 Tell me that you love me."
300,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Candy's Boy,"In Candy's room their are pictures of her saviour on the wall 
 But to get to Candy's room, you got to walk the darkness of Candy's hall 
 Strangers from the city call my baby's number and they bring Candy toys 
 But when I come knockin', she smiles pretty, she knows tonight I'm gonna be Candy's boy. 
 Well, in the olden days when the Mongolian gangs rode herd out on Route 9 
 We go ridin' in the rain, runnin' south, way down through the pines 
 Weekends in the sun in that cheap motel down by the Dynamo 
 We loved each other till their was nothing left and drove that old car as hard and fast as she would go. 
 Well, I got a cold winter wind blowin' behind me and you 
 But Candy's got a man who takes care of her better than I do. 
 Well there's machines and there's fire waiting for us on the edge of town* 
 And there's some boys for hire and there waiting to blow me and Candy down 
 And that's all right 'cause they can't touch us now babe it seems 
 'Cause I know that I will forever be Candy's boy 
 Mmmmm, I will forever be Candy's boy, all right. 
 Let's do the intro. 
 Once more."
301,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Save My Love,"Now there's something coming through the air that softly reminds me 
 Tonight I'll park out on the hill and wait until they find me 
 Here slipping through the ether, a voice is coming through 
 So keep me in your heart tonight and I'll save my love for you. 
 So turn up your radio and, darling, dial me in close 
 We're riding on the airwaves and we're traveling coast to coast 
 Over river and highway, your voice comes clear and true 
 Though we're far apart tonight, I'll save my love for you. 
 Hold me in your arms and our doubts won't break us 
 If we open up our hearts, love won't forsake us 
 Let's let the music take us and carry us home. 
 There's a prayer coming through the air like a shot straight through my heart 
 Tearing open the evening sky, tearing me apart 
 Now I'll ride that signal down the line till I'm home again with you 
 So turn up your radio and I'll save my love for you 
 Turn up your radio and I'll save my love for you."
302,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Ain't Good Enough For You,"Well, you don't like, don't like the way I walk 
 And you don't like, don't like the way I talk 
 You criticize about me endlessly 
 Logic defies how you get stuck with me. 
 And you complain about the clothes I wear 
 And you explain there's other boys out there 
 You complain my car makes too much noise 
 And you cry, I'm always out with the boys. 
 Whoa whoa (whoa whoa whoa whoa) 
 I give up, little darling (whoa whoa, little darling) 
 Yeah, no matter what I do, girl, you know it's true 
 Ain't good enough for you. 
 You complain the way I love you at night 
 You explain I'm really not your type 
 If we go out, you say I'm such a bore 
 If we stay in, you say what are we living for. 
 I don't understand, there's nothing I can do 
 There ain't no way I can satisfy you 
 End of the night, I lean in for a kiss 
 Here comes the pitch, a swing and a miss. 
 Whoa whoa whoa whoa (whoa whoa, whoa whoa) 
 I quit, little darling (whoa whoa, little darling) 
 Yeah, no matter what I do, well, you know it's true 
 Ain't good enough for you, hey!, hey! 
 Whoa whoa whoa whoa (whoa whoa whoa whoa) 
 Hey hey, little darling (whoa whoa, little darling) 
 No matter what I do, girl, you know it's true 
 Ain't good enough for you. 
 I tried to change, I got a job in sales 
 I bought a shirt uptown in Bloomindales 
 And, babe, I tried to make the latest scene 
 Hitting cool just like Jimmy Iovine. 
 I bought a record with all the latest grooves 
 A book of love with all the latest moves 
 I bought some flowers and I waited at your door 
 And you came out, didn't want to see me no more. 
 Whoa whoa whoa (whoa whoa whoa whoa) 
 I quit, little darling (whoa whoa little darling) 
 Yeah, no matter what I do, girl, you know it's true 
 Ain't good enough for you, hey! hey! hey! 
 No matter what I do, girl you know it's true 
 Ain't good enough for you 
 Oh, no matter what I do, girl, you know it's true 
 Ain't good enough for you."
303,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Spanish Eyes,"Springsteen 
 Hey, little girl, is your daddy home 
 Did he go away and leave you all alone? 
 Baby, I been watching you for a long, long time. 
 Come close, we could have us some fun 
 And after the burning is done 
 Our ruins will shine through the night 
 Where you took me with your Spanish eyes. 
 He's your Saturday night special, baby, is he good to you? 
 Does he have money, honey, like I do? 
 Can he do the things that I'll do for you? 
 If your answer it isn't so clear 
 Then maybe you should stay right here 
 And let your doubts slip away 'neath you sighs 
 Let me kiss your Spanish eyes. 
 When the music it plays and the dancers sway with sweet emotion 
 And the dance floor is filled with promises of complete devotion 
 Close to feel your motion, yeah, bring it on in. 
 Come on and stretch out, baby, and call your daddy home 
 I'm running tonight, I won't be long 
 I got something special, baby, just meant for you. 
 Here where the road narrows and turns 
 The only light's from the fire that burns 
 Here 'neath the coal black skies 
 When I look into your Spanish eyes 
 Into your Spanish eyes 
 Into your Spanish eyes 
 Into your Spanish eyes."
304,Bruce Springsteen,rock,It's A Shame,"Well, I walk the way you want me to 
 And I've talk the way you want me to 
 And I've tried to do all I can just to please you. 
 Well, I work hard every day for you 
 And I brought home all my pay for you 
 And I've cried my tears through the rain night and again. 
 And, oh girl, it's a shame 
 Oh girl, it's a doggone shame 
 We worked so hard but it's all in vain 
 Oh girl, it's a shame. 
 Now I bought your gold and diamond rings 
 And I brought you home your pretty things 
 And I thought I'd shown all the love I had for you, yes I did. 
 But as hard as I try it all falls through 
 Well, maybe I was born to be just your fool 
 Trying to satisfy your every desire, each need you require. 
 Well, oh girl, it's a shame 
 Oh girl, it's a doggone shame 
 I worked so hard, but it's all in vain 
 Oh girl, it's a shame. 
 Someone now! 
 Oh girl, it's a shame 
 Oh girl, it's a doggone shame 
 We worked so hard, but it's all in vain 
 Oh girl, it's a shame.

 Oh, girl it's a shame."
305,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Come On (Let's Go Tonight),"Put on your black dress, baby, and put your hair up right 
 There's a party way down in Factory Town tonight 
 I'll be going down there if you need a ride 
 Come on, come on, let's go tonight. 
 How many men fail, their dreams denied 
 They walk through these streets with death in their eyes 
 Now the man on the radio says : 'Elvis Presley died' 
 Come on, come on, let's go tonight. 
 Well, now some came to witness, now some came to weep 
 Drawn by death's strange glory, they stood in the street 
 Drawn together forever in the promise of an endless sleep 
 Come on, come on, let's go tonight 
 Baby, come on, come on, let's go tonight. 
 Da da da da ..."

 The way she gives her love to me 
 I been felt by the graces and angels up above 
 The little things my baby does 
 The little things my baby does 
 The little things my baby does that make me love her. 
 The way she sighs when I hold her tight 
 Good times and bad will be alright 
 Faces on the street they push hard and they shove 
 Disappear with the little things my baby does 
 The little things my baby does 
 The little things my baby does, I know I love her. 
 The soft summer breeze fills her every sigh 
 Her eyes are bluer than the summer sky. 
 I been felt by the graces and angels up above 
 The little things my baby does 
 The little things my baby does 
 The little things my baby does that make me love her. 
 And when the night closes in 
 I'm drifting and I can't find a friend 
 On the wings of the angels I'm saved by her love 
 The little things my baby does 
 The little things my baby does 
 The little things my baby does that make me love her. 
 The little things my baby does 
 The little things my baby does 
 The little things my baby does

308,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Breakaway,"Sonny abandoned his car last night 
 Had a meeting on the docks with a light blue Monterrey 
 To breakaway. 
 Sonny was playing all his cards last night 
 In a hotel room he dealt his life away 
 To breakaway. 
 Now the promises and the lies they demand it 
 Let the hearts that have been broken stand as the price you pay 
 To breakaway, oh, breakaway, oh Ronde, Ronde, Ronde, Ronde Ray 
 To breakaway. 
 Janie slipped from behind the bar last night 
 Cashed out and walked onto streets rainy and grey 
 To breakaway. 
 Janie slid into a car last night 
 In a parking lot she gave her soul away 
 To breakaway. 
 Now the promises and the lies they demand it 
 Let the hearts that have been broken stand as the price you pay 
 To breakaway, oh, breakaway, oh Ronde, Ronde, Ronde, Ronde Ray 
 To breakaway. 
 Bobby lay 'neath a sheet of stars last night 
 His back on blacktop still warm from the heat of the day 
 From breakaway. 
 Bobby went down hard last night 
 Saw a shooting star as the evening light slipped away 
 From breakaway. 
 Now the promises and the lies they demand it

 I ain't in no hurry so just take your time. 
 Some people wanna die young and gloriously 
 But, Taxi Cab driver, well, that ain't me 
 I got a cute little baby down at 12th and Vine 
 And she opens for business just about closing time. 
 Ah hey hey, ah hey hey 
 City of night, city of night.

 I got my money, I can take my fare. 
 Ah hey hey, ah hey hey

 The way you warm me baby when I'm cold 
 The way you make me want you body and soul 
 The way the rivers run to the sea 
 Well, hey, that's the way you belong to me. 
 The way you soothe me when I'm in pain 
 The way you make the blood rush in my veins 
 The way the winds rush through the trees 
 Well hey, that's the way you belong to me. 
 When I lose faith you take my hand 
 The way you make me feel like I'm a man 
 The way the sun belongs to the sea 
 Well, hey, that's the way you belong to me. 
 The way you make me feel like I belong 
 And if I could, girl, though I know it'd be wrong 
 I'd lock you deep inside till the last rains fall 
 And hide you from the emptiness of it all. 
 Sometimes at night I lie awake 
 I pull you close and feel each breath you take

 Well, hey, that's the way you belong to me."

 We take care of our own 
 We take care of our own 
 Wherever this flag's flown 
 We take care of our own 
 From Chicago to New Orleans 
 From the muscle to the bone 
 From the shotgun shack to the Super Dome 
 There ain't no help, the cavalry stayed home 
 There ain't no one hearing the bugle blowin' 
 We take care of our own 
 We take care of our own 
 Wherever this flag's flown 
 We take care of our own 
 Where're the eyes, the eyes with the will to see 
 Where are the hearts that run over with mercy 
 Where's the love that has not forsaken me 
 Where's the work that'll set my hands, my soul free 
 Where's the spirit that'll reign, reign over me 
 Where's the promise from sea to shining sea 
 Where's the promise from sea to shining sea

 Shackled and drawn, shackled and drawn 
 Pick up the rock, son, and carry it on 
 Trudging through the dark in a world gone wrong 
 Woke up this morning shackled and drawn 
 Whoa! 
 Alright, yeah! 
 I always love the feel of sweat on my shirt 
 Stand back, son, and let a man work 
 Let a man work, is that so wrong 
 I woke up this morning shackled and drawn 
 Shackled and drawn, shackled and drawn 
 Pick up the rock, son, and carry it on 
 What's a poor boy to do in a world gone wrong 
 Woke up this morning shackled and drawn 
 Freedom, son, is a dirty shirt 
 The sun on my face and my shovel in the dirt 
 The shovel in the dirt keeps the devil gone 
 I woke up this morning shackled and drawn 
 Shackled and drawn, shackled and drawn 
 Pick up the rock, son, and carry it on

 The banker man grows fatter, the working man grows thin 
 It's all happened before and it'll happen again 
 It'll happen again, they'll bet your life

 Here we stood the drought, now we'll stand the flood

 No dictators were crowned 
 I awoke from a quiet night, I never heard a sound 
 Marauders raided in the dark and brought death to my hometown, boys 
 Death to my hometown 
 They destroyed our families' factories and they took our homes 
 They left our bodies on the plains, the vultures picked our bones 
 So listen up, my sonny boy, be ready for when they come 
 For they'll be returning sure as the rising sun 
 Now get yourself a song to sing and sing it 'til you're done 
 Yeah, sing it hard and sing it well 
 Send the robber barons straight to hell 
 The greedy thieves who came around 
 And ate the flesh of everything they found 
 Whose crimes have gone unpunished now

 Sun's in the heavens and a new day's rising 
 You use your muscle and your mind and you pray your best 
 That your best is good enough, the Lord will do the rest 
 You raise your children and you teach 'them to walk straight and sure 
 You pray that hard times, hard times, come no more 
 You try to sleep, you toss and turn, the bottom's dropping out 
 Where you once had faith now there's only doubt 
 You pray for guidance, only silence now meets your prayers 
 The morning breaks, you awake but no one's there 
 We've been traveling over rocky ground, rocky ground 
 There's a new day coming 
 We've been traveling over rocky ground, rocky ground 
 (I'm a soldier!) 
 We've been traveling over rocky ground, rocky ground 
 There's a new day coming 
 We've been traveling over rocky ground, rocky ground 
 (I'm a soldier!) 
 We've been traveling over rocky ground, rocky ground 
 There's a new day coming 
 We've been traveling over rocky ground, rocky ground 
 (I'm a soldier!) 
 We've been traveling over rocky ground, rocky ground 
 There's a new day coming 
 We've been traveling over rocky ground, rocky ground 
 We've been traveling over rocky ground, rocky ground 
 We've been traveling over rocky ground, rocky ground 
 We've been traveling over rocky ground, rocky ground 
 We've been traveling over rocky ground, rocky ground"
320,Bruce Springsteen,rock,We Are Alive,"There's a cross up yonder up on Calvary Hill 
 There's a slip of blood on a silver knife 
 There's a graveyard kid down below 
 Where at night did come to life 
 And above the stars, they crackle in fire 
 A dead man's moon throws seven rings 
 Well, we put our ears to the cold grave stones 
 This is the song they'd sing 
 We are alive 
 And though our bodies lie alone here in the dark 
 Our spirits rise to carry the fire and light the spark 
 To stand shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart 
 A voice cried out, I was killed in Maryland in 1877 
 When the railroad workers made their stand 
 Well, I was killed in 1963 one Sunday morning in Birmingham 
 Well, I died last year crossing the southern desert 
 My children left behind in San Pablo 
 Well they left our bodies here to rot 
 Oh please let them know 
 We are alive 
 Oh, and though we lie alone here in the dark 
 Our souls will rise to carry the fire and light the spark 
 To fight shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart 
 Let your mind rest easy, sleep well my friend 
 It's only our bodies that betray us in the end 
 I awoke last night in a dark and dreamy deep 
 From my head to my feet, my body had gone stone cold 
 There were worms crawling all around me 
 Fingers scratching at an earth black and six foot low 
 And alone in the blackness of my grave 
 Alone I'd been left to die 
 Then I heard voices calling all around me 
 The earth rose above me, my eyes filled with sky 
 We are alive 
 And though our bodies lie alone here in the dark 
 Our souls and spirits rise 
 To carry the fire and light the spark 
 To fight shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart 
 To stand shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart 
 We are alive"
321,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Swallowed Up (In The Belly Of The Whale),"I fell asleep 
 On a dark and starless sea 
 With nothing but the cloak 
 Of God's mercy over me 
 I come upon strange earth 
 And to a great black cave 
 I dreamt I awoke 
 As if buried in my grave 
 We've been swallowed up 
 We've been swallowed up 
 Disappeared from this world 
 We've been swallowed up 
 Bones of sailors from the north 
 And sailors from the east 
 Lay high and up high 
 In the in the belly of a beast 
 A beast should you wander in its path 
 On your ship and your flesh you serve 
 You disappear from this world 
 Till you've been swallowed up 
 We've been swallowed up 
 We've been swallowed up 
 Disappeared from this world 
 We've been swallowed up 
 Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah 
 Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah 
 Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah 
 Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah 
 We trusted our skills 
 And our good selves 
 Put our faith that with God 
 The righteous in this world prevail 
 But we've been swallowed up 
 We've been swallowed up 
 Disappeared from this world 
 We've been swallowed up 
 We've been swallowed up 
 We've been swallowed up

 Down in the kitchen, working in the coal mine

 Messy little problem, maybe baby need a new dress 
 Razor-back diamond, you shine too hard 
 Need a hammer help you handle a little trouble in your backyard 
 (Bring it on down to Harry's Place) 
 When Harry speaks, it's Harry's streets, in Harry's house it's Harry's roads 
 You don't wanna be around, brother, when Harry scolds 
 It's Harry's car, Harry's wife, Harry's dogs run Harry's town 
 Your blood and money spit shines Harry's crown 
 You don't fuck with Harry's money, you don't fuck Harry's girls 
 These are the rules, this is the world

 You need a little shot of something, dear, to improve your health 
 A taste of that one little weakness you allow yourself 
 You're looking for the key of that box you locked yourself in 
 Just stood up to the line and be one of Harry's friends 
 Shadow on the corner, no light, no sign 
 Nobody on the street 'cept the deaf, dumb and blind 
 Now Connor's on the couch, Father McGowan's at the bar 
 Chief Horden's at the door checking who the fuck you are 
 C saw Bobby dressed in drag and Mr. Nice 
 Carry me into a back room and dim the lights 
 My arms strapped to the table, a thousand angels spinning up the room 
 A voice whispers in my head, 
 ""We do what we must do.""

323,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Just Like Fire Would,"One night in a motel room 
 Eyes cast like steel 
 I drank the wine that they left on my table 
 Knew the morning was too far 
 I smoked my last cigarette 
 Stay only to defy 
 The night was dark and the land was cold 
 And I was frozen right to the bone 
 Just like fire would I burn up 
 Just like fire would 
 Just like fire would I burn up 
 500 miles I've gone today 
 Tomorrow's 500 more 
 Outside my window the world passes by 
 It's stranger than a dream 
 Just like fire would I burn up 
 Just like fire would 
 Just like fire would I burn up 
 I go to work and I earn my pay, Lord 
 And the sweat it falls to the ground 
 I see you now but we may never meet again, child 
 The ice is hangin' on the door 
 One night in a motel room 
 Eyes cast like steel 
 I drank the wine that they left on the table 
 Knew the morning was too far 
 Just like fire would I burn up 
 Just like fire would 
 Just like fire would I burn up 
 Just like fire would I burn up

 Sun comes every morning but it ain't no friend 
 I get dressed and I go back again 
 The rain it keeps on falling on twisted bones and dirt 
 I'm buried to my heart here in this hurt 
 Fire keeps on burning, you're waiting in the cold 
 Down in the hole 
 (down in the hole) 
 Dark and bloody autumn pierces my heart 
 The memory of your kiss tears me apart 
 The sky above is turning, the world below's gone gray 
 I thought that I could turn and walk away 
 The fire keeps on burning and I'm working in the cold 
 Down in the hole 
 (down in the hole) 
 Radio's crackling with the headlines, wind in the phone lines 
 The sun upon your shoulder, empty city skylines 
 The day rips apart, a dark and bloody arrow pierced my heart 
 I got nothing but heart and sky and sunshine, the things you left behind 
 I wake to find my city's gone to black 
 The days just keep on falling, your voice it keeps on calling 
 I'm gonna dig right here until I get you back 
 Fires keep on burning, I'm here with you in the cold 
 Down in the hole

 You drunken choir boys, shake it up 
 Our Juliet says her Romeo's been found

 Sitting having a beer 
 Einstein trying to figure out the number that adds up to this 
 Shakespeare said, 
 ""Man, it all starts with a kiss."" 
 Einstein is scratching 
 Numbers on his napkin 
 Shakespeare said, 
 ""Man, it's just one and one make three. 
 Ah, that's why it's poetry.""

 From here on in we're eating take out 
 She ain't gonna be cooking for the likes of us 
 Somebody call mama and just tell her 
 Frankie fell in love 
 Glory, glory, it's the same old story 
 Kid, there ain't nothing anybody can do 
 It's gonna happen to you

327,Bruce Springsteen,rock,This Is Your Sword,"Now brothers and sisters, listen to me 
 These are the few things that I leave to thee 
 The sword of our fathers with lessons hard taught 
 The shield strong and sturdy from battles well fought 
 Well, this is your sword, this is your shield 
 This is the power of love revealed 
 Carry them with you wherever you go 
 And give all the love that you have in your soul 
 At times there are dark, dark must cover the earth 
 This world's filled with the beauty of God's work 
 Hold tight to your brawn, stay righteous, stay strong 
 When the days of miracles will come along 
 Now this is your sword, this is your shield 
 This is the power of love revealed 
 Carry it with you wherever you go 
 And give all the love that you have in your soul 
 In the days of despair you can grow hard 
 Till you close your mind and empty your heart 
 If you find yourself staring in the abyss 
 Hold tight to your loved ones and remember this 
 This shield will protect your secret heart 
 The sword will defend from what comes in the dark 
 Should you grow weary on the battle field 
 Well, do not despair, our love is real 
 This is your sword, this is your shield 
 This is the power of love revealed 
 Carry it with you wherever you go 
 And give all the love that you have in your soul 
 And give all the love that you have in your soul

328,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Hunter Of Invisible Game,"I hauled myself up out of a ditch 
 I built me an ark out of gopher wood and pitch 
 Sat down by the roadside and waited on the rain 
 Honey, I'm the hunter of invisible game 
 Well, I woke last night to the heavy clicking and clack 
 And a scarecrow on fire along the railroad tracks 
 There were empty cities and burning plains 
 Honey, I'm the hunter of invisible game 
 We all come up a little short and we go down hard 
 These days I spend my time skipping through the dark 
 Through the empires of dust I chant your name 
 I am the hunter of the invisible game 
 Through the bone yard we rattled and black smoke we rolled on 
 Down into the valley where the beast has his throne 
 I sing my song and I sharpen my blade 
 I am the hunter of the invisible game 
 Strength is vanity and time is illusion 
 I feel you breathing, the rest is confusion 
 Your skin touches mine, what else to explain 
 Honey, I'm the hunter of invisible game 
 Now pray for yourself and that you may not fall 
 When the hour of deliverance comes on us all 
 When high hope and faith and courage and trust 
 Can rise or vanish like dust and dust 
 Now there's a kingdom of love waiting to be reclaimed 
 I am the hunter of the invisible game 
 I am the hunter of the invisible game 
 I am the hunter of the invisible game"
329,Bruce Springsteen,rock,The Wall,"Cigarettes and a bottle of beer 
 This poem that I wrote for you 
 This black stone and these hard tears 
 Are all I got left now of you 
 I remember you in your Marine uniform laughing 
 Laughing at your shipping out party 
 I read Robert McNamara says he's sorry 
 Your high boots and strap T-shirt 
 Ah, Billy you looked so bad 
 Yeah, you and your rock and roll band 
 It was the best thing this shit town ever had 
 Now the men that put you here eat with their families 
 In rich dining halls 
 And apology and forgiveness 
 Got no place here at all, at the wall 
 Well, I'm sorry I missed you last year 
 I couldn't find no one to drive me 
 If your eyes could cut through that black stone 
 Tell me would they recognize me? 
 For the living time that must be served 
 As the day goes on 
 Cigarettes and a bottle of beer 
 Skin on black stone 
 On the ground, dog tags and wreaths of flowers 
 With the ribbons red as the blood 
 Red as the blood you spilled 
 In the Central Highlands mud 
 Limousines rush down Pennsylvania Avenue 
 Rustling the leaves as they fall 
 And apology and forgiveness 
 Got no place here at all, here at the wall"

 Hot and bloody summer, drifting blue eyes 
 We're in the high grass, I finger your hemline 
 Boot heels click clacking, honey, when you shine 
 Autumn blue skies, hair sweet as the southern pines 
 American beauty forever in time 
 Out on this highway counting white lines 
 Your hand cups your breast, pledging your time 
 Things we carried, shining skylines 
 Falling sparrow, sky torn apart 
 Dark shining arrow, your kiss pierces my heart 
 American beauty forever mine 
 Out on this highway counting white lines"

 This town's a secret shared and shattered in a sad song 
 Just torn and tattered pieces of a love gone wrong 
 Hearts of stone and eyes gone deep blue 
 Lonely houses filled two by two 
 Mary, Mary, where have you run to 
 (Mary, Mary, where have you run to) 
 Summer storm blew in soft and cool 
 Onto slinky town streets where love ruled 
 Now there's just a misty sidewalk with the rain drifting through 
 Lipstick case and one lonely red shoe

 I try and try, you treat me like a fool 
 It makes me wanna cry, it makes me feel so blue

 My little candy girl, so hard-hearted and cruel 
 I think that's what keeps me coming back

 I came to get you last night, Cindy, at quarter to six 
 Your daddy came to the door, he said Cindy got sick 
 She got sent home from work with a note from the nurse 
 And that my very own presence would make your condition worse 
 But it ain't your health, 'cause honey you sure look fine 
 Little girl it's something else that's on my mind 
 But whatever you've got, well you can give it to me 
 'Cause if it's good enough for you, it's good enough for me

 I'm just searching, girl 
 For the blood, for the bone, for the muscle, for what's real 
 I was busted for feeling no pain 
 Charged with doing things I can't explain 
 Picked up for parole violation 
 Locked with the boys in the subway station 
 I pushed my way through the heart of the crowd 
 I shoved my way through the heart of the crowd 
 Past the sign saying this is not allowed 
 To where someone's standing straight and shouting out loud 
 Handcuffed to the jailhouse door 
 Transmitting from the gallows floor 
 And if you're sick, if you're tired, if you're bored 
 Check the line, check the time, check the action, check the score

337,Bruce Springsteen,rock,The Man Who Got Away,"Last night I went to the Coronado 
 I bought my ticket and I found my seat 
 It was a new adventure straight from Hollywood 
 Lights went down as I felt the heat 
 They went tearing from the final scene 
 Burning rubber, spilling gasoline 
 As the credits rolled away 
 They were still chasing the man who got away 
 Well, every night for weeks and weeks now 
 I beat the traffic, I beat the heat now 
 For two hours I can believe now 
 The man who got away was me 
 I went tearing from the final scene 
 Burning rubber, spilling gasoline 
 As the credits rolled away 
 They were still chasing the man who got away 
 Drove into Stockton, my radio went dead 
 That's when I heard what the newsman said 
 Said, ""armed robbery on the ten-hundred block 
 Was two men involved and one man shot 
 Well, while his accomplice made the payday 
 With a 45 he blew the cashier away way 
 Last seen headed on the State Highway 
 Driving a late model Chevrolet 
 I went screaming from the final scene 
 In a hail of bullets and flaming gasoline 
 As the credits rolled away 
 They were still chasing the man who got away 
 Man that got away 
 Man that got away 
 Man that got away 
 Whoa!"
338,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Little White Lies,"We met on open streets where we both had no place to go 
 I remember how my heart beat when you said ""Oh Billy I love you so"" 
 Now, standing in the doorway, did you ever think that we could look this old 
 Victims of the little white lies that we told 
 We did not count tomorrows, we took what we could and ran 
 There was no time for sorrow, every place you went I held your hand 
 And when the night closed in I was sure your kisses told me all I had to know 
 But they never whispered the little white lies that we told 
 It was so good at the start, nothing could ever pull it apart 
 Running hand in hand through the rain, but soon the heart break, soon the pain, girl 
 There were no cold denials, nobody really lied 
 It wasn't in the things we said, girl, just time spent, promises implied 
 And when it began to fall apart eaten quietly away from the inside 
 Bit by bit by those little white lies 
 Hey! 
 Hey! 
 Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, hey hey hey! 
 Now standing in the doorway, did you ever think, ever think that we could look this old 
 Victims of the little white lies that we told 
 Now lying here in the dark, did you ever think, ever think that we could be this cold 
 Just as cold as the little white lies that we told 
 Little white lies 
 Little white lies 
 Little white lies 
 Little white lies 
 Little white lies"
339,Bruce Springsteen,rock,The Time That Never Was,"Oh whoa whoa 
 Oh whoa 
 Oh whoa 
 Sometimes I wake up in the morning 
 And it cuts me like a knife 
 I come face-to-face with my longing 
 For another world, another life 
 And a time that never was 
 Oh a time that never was 
 We drove on, fueled not by the future 
 But by a past we could never touch 
 Forced to run head-on collisions 
 Till we vanished in the dust 
 Of a time that never was 
 Whoa whoa whoa, the time that never was 
 Whoa whoa whoa whoa 
 So kiss me once more baby 
 One more kiss baby you must 
 Don't ever let me forget, girl 
 A time that never was 
 A time that never was 
 Oh whoa whoa, the time that never was 
 Oh whoa whoa, the time that never was 
 Oh whoa whoa, that never was 
 Oh whoa whoa whoa 
 Oh whoa whoa 
 Oh whoa whoa whoa"
340,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Night Fire,"Now you're running with the right crowd 
 Well you better watch the friends you're choosing 
 Girl I know you're a walking winner now 
 But you better keep your eye on who's doing the losing 
 All the faces staring down your throat 
 All the eyes, darling, that never closed 
 In your sadness, girl, maybe there's something that you ought to know 
 Night fire, the night fire is out in the dark burning 
 Night fire, the night fire is down in the street yearning 
 You're running with the right crowd 
 Money and the wine are flowing 
 You found a place with the right crowd 
 But you forgot about that storm, that storm that's blowing 
 (Dance on) Let the music play 
 (Dance on) Let the night roll to day 
 (Dance on) Don't listen to what they say 
 Just keep moving to the beat, to the beat, to the big beat 
 Night fire, the night fire is out in the dark burning 
 Night fire, the night fire is down in the street yearning 
 Well they punch your ticket as you grow old 
 Do you really get used to being bought and sold 
 Does a brand new dress keep out the cold 
 Do your brand new friends help you to keep 
 Your pretty eyes from seeing what they shouldn't see 
 The sound of breaking glass and running feet 
 The sound of breaking glass and running feet 
 Won't you tell me, baby, I got to know 
 Won't you tell me, baby, I got to know 
 Won't you tell me, baby, I got to know 
 Won't you tell me, baby, I got to know 
 Won't you tell me, baby, I got to know

341,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Whitetown,"Mary Ann on the avenue 
 Girl all dressed up in Kensington blue 
 Down where the hammer falls 
 She's born and bred within Whitetown walls 
 Each and every thing slowly passes away 
 She moves alone along the narrow street 
 From a passing car she hears the music play 
 Beneath the ""El"" she starts to sway 
 Down in Whitetown, oh yeah 
 Down in Whitetown, oh yeah 
 Down in Whitetown 
 Johnny's just trying to make his way 
 He's got a job but mister it don't pay 
 He sits and counts the scars 
 On a stool down the end of a Whitetown bar 
 And the old men here piss their lives away 
 Drinking and joking about their cop-fighting days 
 Ain't no answers here, just the past and fear 
 Of spending the rest of your days 
 Down in Whitetown, oh yeah 
 Down in Whitetown, oh yeah 
 Down in Whitetown 
 Hoo hoo, hoo hoo 
 Da da da 
 Hoo hoo, hoo hoo 
 Ah ah ah 
 In a dream salvation comes with a beat 
 Or the sound of breaking glass and running feet 
 The beat that echoes down through the streets 
 Mary Ann dances on 
 Down in Whitetown, oh yeah 
 Down in Whitetown 
 Down in Whitetown, oh yeah 
 Down in Whitetown, oh yeah 
 Down in Whitetown 
 Hoo hoo, hoo hoo

 Well there's a rumble in the park, there's a thunder in the dark 
 The night's so quiet, it's chain lightning 
 Beneath a street light two boys bopping in the night 
 They have something in 'em called chain lightning 
 Though you never hear a sound, there's a fire underground 
 Rambling through the town, you can't keep it from coming down 
 Lovers walking through the mist, Romeo he steal a kiss 
 Caught up in the moment of chain lightning 
 Hey, hey! 
 Now I don't know about romance, but baby it's the latest thing 
 Everybody's getting up, doing it, chain lightning 
 All along the strand baby down in jungleland 
 Everybody's caught up in chain lightning 
 Ever hear the sound of a fire underground 
 Rumbling through the town, the big cold is coming down 
 Sitting at the light, I'm a rider in the night 
 Streaking light to light for chain lightning 
 Hey! 
 Hey! Hey! Hey hey hey! Hey! Hey! 
 Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! 
 I ain't into style, baby, ain't into fashion 
 I just got a passion for chain lightning 
 Sitting at the light, I'm a rider in the night 
 Streaking light to light for chain lightning 
 Yeah

343,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Party Lights,"I know the girls well they grow up fast where you come from 
 You left behind what was asked and you were married baby oh so young 
 Now that little girl of yours looks like she's growing up overnight 
 But do you miss the party lights 
 Do you miss the party lights 
 Do you miss the party lights when you're lying in bed at night 
 He was gonna be your Romeo, you were gonna be his Juliet 
 These days you don't wait on Romeos, you just wait on that welfare check 
 While other girls your age are out with lovers taking in the night 
 Do you miss the party lights 
 Do you miss the party lights 
 Do you miss the party lights when you're lying in bed at night 
 Sometimes I see you on the street and you look so tired 
 I know that job you've got leaves you so uninspired 
 When I stop by to take you out to eat 
 I find you lying, all dressed up on the bed, baby, fast asleep 
 Go! 
 Then as I lean across the bed, darling, to switch out the light 
 I wonder if you miss the party lights 
 Do you miss the party lights 
 Do you miss the party lights when you're lying in bed at night 
 Grab your coat and grab your hat, go in the bathroom, put that make up on 
 We're gonna take that little brat, we're gonna drop her off at your mom's 
 Yeah just give me a sign, I'm waiting on the line tonight 
 If you miss the party lights 
 If you miss the party lights 
 If you miss the party lights when you're lying in bed at night 
 Do you miss the party lights when you're lying in bed at night

344,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Stray Bullet,"In the tall grass we held hands 
 Down by the river we made plans 
 Of what would and would not be 
 It was impossible to see 
 Their black boots shone in the sun 
 They were waiting on the Annandale train when my baby come 
 Little girl with the long black hair 
 Do you know what lies 'neath the long coats that they wear 
 Once I swore you'd ride with me (to some far and distant shore) 
 Down where this river meets the sea (I'll make you mine forevermore) 
 Over these dark hills I'd walk along (just to hold you in my arms) 
 To lie with you on a bed of stone 
 River blood red with the years 
 You can flood this valley with a thousand tears 
 Wash away all that's been found 
 But you'll never wash away the sound 
 Of the stray bullet that shot my baby down, (stray bullet shot my baby down) 
 Of the stray bullet that shot my baby down, (stray bullet shot my baby down) 
 Of the stray bullet that shot my baby down, (stray bullet shot my baby down) 
 Of the stray bullet that shot my baby down"

 Drink from a magic fountain 
 Give your woman all the love you can give her 
 Don't you want to be an outlaw 
 Don't you want to ride the range 
 Don't you want to be an outlaw, children 
 Just like Jesse, like Jesse James, like Jesse 
 Don't you want to swim the ocean 
 Don't you want to climb the highest tree 
 Drink some of Mama's love potion 
 Kiss your woman till she just can't see 
 Don't you want to be an outlaw 
 Just a poor boy out on the skids 
 Don't you want to be an outlaw, children 
 Just like Billy, like Billy the Kid 
 Jesse was a bad boy 
 He roamed the wild west 
 And many notches on his gun, as the year of '21 
 Someone laid him to an early rest 
 Don't you want to climb a mountain 
 (Well) Don't you want to ride the river 
 Drink from a magic fountain 
 Give your woman all the love that you can give her 
 Don't you want to be an outlaw 
 Don't you want to ride the range 
 Don't you want to be an outlaw, children 
 Just like Jesse, like Jesse James, like Jesse

350,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Henry Boy,"They broke your toys this morning, Henry 
 Rode your board right into dust 
 Surrounded you with strangers who you could not trust 
 And then they had the gall 
 To write your name up on the girls' room wall 
 And send you out to Maria 
 Who spoke of babies and all 
 And wanted to shoot your joy 
 It's a hard world when you're the new kid in town 
 Ain't it, Henry Boy 
 Well the North side is for diamond-studded woman 
 Subtly selling their wares 
 And the West side is for debutantes 
 And would be millionaires 
 Oh the East side is for lost boys 
 Who know their moves too well 
 The South side is for gamblers, Henry Boy 
 The train stops once for Hell 
 It's a hard world when they're forcing you 
 To live your life out on Broadway 
 But Henry I'm sure you're gonna like it well 
 The constellation she points to Gate Eleven 
 That's where you got your connections 
 Let me take a look inside my magic book 
 I don't think you're beyond my inventions 
 Oh these doctor's appendages I'm giving you for wings 
 I'm sure it'll meet the occasion 
 I'm gonna mix you some magic, you'll spittin' sparks 
 And ready for the invasion 
 Oh and the Milky Way's a trip for dippers 
 They saw ya coming a mile away 
 In the amusement park you'll get clipped by rippers 
 Hiding behind candy 'cades 
 In the alleyway you'll get ripped by strippers 
 All who know your name 
 In the stalls sit the soldier-boy kissersOn leave for just a day 
 And Henry couldn't take it 
 He's gonna be a submariner 
 Riding underground for the Pope 
 Gonna stand on the corner of Broadway 
 And scream: ""Up 'scope"""
351,Bruce Springsteen,rock,I Ain't Got No Home,"I ain't got no home, I'm just a-ramblin' 'round 
 Work when I can get it, I roam from town to town 
 The police make it hard, boys, wherever I may go 
 I ain't got no home in this world anymore 
 I was farmin' shares and always I was done 
 My debts they was so many they wouldn't go around 
 Drought got my crops and Mr. Banker's at my door 
 And I ain't got no home in this world anymore 
 Six children I have raised, they're scattered and they're gone 
 And my darling wife to heaven she has flown 
 She died of the fever upon the cabin floor 
 And I ain't got no home in this world anymore 
 I mined in your mines and I gathered in your corn 
 I been workin' mister since the day that I was born 
 I worry all the time like I never did before 
 'Cause I ain't got no home in this world anymore 
 Well, now I just ramble 'round to see what I can see 
 This wide wicked world is a funny place to be 
 The gamblin' man is rich and the workin' man is poor 
 I ain't got no home in this world anymore 
 I'm stranded on this road that goes from sea to sea 
 A hundred thousand others are stranded here with me 
 A hundred thousand others, yes, a hundred thousand more 
 I ain't got no home in this world anymore"
352,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Stay,"Now the seats are all empty 
 Let the roadies take the stage 
 Pack it up and tear it down 
 They're the first to come and last to leave 
 Working for that minimum wage 
 They'll set it up in another town 
 Tonight the people were so fine 
 They waited there in line 
 And when they got up on their feet they made the show 
 And that was sweet 
 But I can hear the sound 
 Of slamming doors and folding chairs 
 And that's a sound they'll never know 
 Now roll them cases out and lift them amps 
 Haul them trusses down and get'em up them ramps 
 'Cause when it comes to moving me 
 You know you guys are the champs 
 But when that last guitar's been packed away 
 You know that I still want to play 
 So just make sure you got it all set to go 
 Before you come for my piano 
 But the band's on the bus 
 And they're waiting to go 
 We've got to drive all night and do a show in Chicago 
 Or Detroit, I don't know 
 We do so many shows in a row 
 And these towns all look the same 
 We just pass the time in our hotel rooms 
 And wander 'round backstage 
 Till those lights come up and we hear that crowd 
 And we remember why we came 
 Now we got country and western on the bus 
 Are and be, 
 We got disco in eight tracks and cassettes in stereo 
 We've got rural scenes and magazines 
 We've got truckers on the CB 
 We've got Richard Pryor on the video 
 We got time to think of the ones we love 
 While the miles roll away 
 But the only time that seems too short 
 Is the time that we get to play 
 People you've got the power over what we do 
 You can sit there and wait 
 Or you can pull us through 
 Come along, sing the song 
 You know that you can't go wrong 
 'Cause when that morning sun comes beating down 
 You're going to wake up in your town 
 But we'll be scheduled to appear 
 A thousand miles away from here 
 People stay just a little bit longer 
 We want to play, just a little bit longer 
 Now the promoter don't mind 
 And the union don't mind 
 If we take a little time 
 And we leave it all behind and sing 
 One more song 
 Oh won't you stay 
 Just a little bit longer 
 Please please please, say you will 
 Say you will 
 Oh won't you stay 
 Just a little bit longer 
 Oh please please please stay 
 Just a little bit long 
 I bet promotors don't mind 
 And the roadies don't mind 
 If we take a little time 
 And we leave this all behind 
 Singing one more song"
353,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Remember When The Music,"Remember when the music 
 Came from wooden boxes 
 Strung with silver wires 
 And as we sang 
 The words would set our hearts on fire 
 To believe in things 
 So we'd sing 
 Remember when the music 
 Brought us all together 
 To stand inside the rain 
 And as we'd join hands 
 We'd meet in the refrain 
 With dreams to live 
 And hope to give 
 Remember when the music 
 Was the best that we'd dream of 
 For our's children's time 
 And as we'd worked we'd sing 
 'Cause we knew time 
 Was just a lie 
 A gift to say 
 A gift that future gave 
 Remember when the music 
 Was a rock we could cling to 
 So we would not despair 
 And as we sang we'd knew 
 We'd hear an echo in the air 
 And if we weren't smiling then 
 We'd smile again 
 And all the times I listened 
 And all the times I heard 
 And all the melodies I'm missing 
 And all the magic words 
 All the beautiful words 
 All the beautiful voices 
 And all the choices we had theni hope you find you got 
 Those kind of choices once again 
 Remember when the music 
 Brought the night 
 Across the valley 
 And as we hum the melody 
 We'd be safe within the sound 
 So we'd sleep 
 To awake with dreams 
 And promises to keep"

 Stormy days, we pass the time away 
 Sleeping in some good warm place 
 A cop come along we give him a little race 
 Say was that a vigilante man? 
 Well tell me why does a vigilante man 
 Tell me why does a vigilante man 
 Carry that sawed off shotgun in his hands 
 To shoot his brothers and sisters down that no good vigilante man 
 Well I ramble around from town to town 
 Yeah I ramble around from town to town 
 Yeah and they run us around like a wild herd of cattle lord 
 Is that your vigilante man? 
 Well tell me why does a vigilante man 
 Tell me why does a vigilante man 
 Carry that club in his hands 
 Would he beat an innocent man down that no good vigilante man"

 Well I'm six days runnin' but I'm 30 days out

 You got me mostly waitin' for that other shoe to drop

 You keep me six days runnin' but I'm 30 days out

 With every kiss you leave a little shadow of doubt

 You just smile and tell me ""Baby there ain't nothin' wrong"" 
 In your smile there's a sign in red 
 It said ""Thousand miles of hard road dead ahead""

358,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Angelyne,"(Cover: gary u.s. bonds. written by springsteen) 
 He was a bouncer in a joint called tony's body shop 
 She was a night cashier down at the stop 'n' shop 
 He was kinda good-lookin' 
 And she was kinda fun 
 They met 'neath that big oak tree 
 Out where the river runs 
 Little angelyne, little angelyne 
 As the sun goes down and the moonlight shines 
 Back of a greyhound bus sit two lovers entwined 
 Just big bill and little angelyne 
 She was just in from Texas, didn't know her way around 
 So he took her to a roadhouse on the edge of town 
 In the beerhall light she looked so fine 
 And so he popped the question that was on his mind 
 It was a simple affair, only a friend or two 
 Preacher asked if they did, they said they do 
 She bought two tickets with her daddy's American express 
 And hopped a greyhound bus in her wedding dress 
 Little angelyne, little angelyne 
 As the sun goes down and the moonlight shines 
 Back of a greyhound bus sit two lovers entwined 
 Just big bill and little angelyne 
 In a six dollar motel with the honey bun 
 With seven glorious days in the nevada sun 
 He played the tables, she pumped the slots full of dimes 
 They came back broke but they had a good time 
 Now many fell apart in the years come and gone 
 But big bill and little angel they'd last on and on 
 They held together when the times grew thin 
 A little boy that looked like her, and a girl that looked like him 
 So mister don't you pay it no mind 
 Let the sun go down and the moonlight shine 
 Back of a greyhound bus sit two lovers entwined 
 Just big bill and little angelyne 
 Little angelyne, little angelyne 
 As the sun goes down and the moonlight shines 
 Back of a greyhound bus sit two lovers entwined 
 Just big bill and little angelyne

 As the sun goes down and the moonlight shines 
 Back of a greyhound bus sit two lovers entwined 
 Just big bill and little angelyne"
359,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Dedication,"Well way back in the Bible time 
 A cat named noah built an ocean liner 
 Everybody laughed when they told him why 
 But when the rain came, noah was high and dry 
 'Cause he had 
 Dedication baby through and through 
 Dedication like I give to you 
 Dedication girl every way 
 Dedication girl every day 
 Well admiral byrd and some eskimos

 When they said it was a miracle they made it back 
 Well they said that wasn't any miracle, jack 
 Dedication baby through and through

 Dedication girl every way 
 Dedication girl every day 
 Well now there was a movie star out in Hollywood 
 He met a little girl, they got along real good 
 He tried to split but the chick said ""buddy, not so fast 
 Ain't gonna wrap me on your arms, then wrap me in some cash"" 
 Now it was on TV every word they said 
 If you didn't see it man, you must have been late 
 She got on the witness pedestal without care 
 She turned to the judge and this is what she said 
 Dedication judge every way 
 Dedication judge in every way 
 I need some 
 Dedication judge that can't be spent 
 A little dedication judge to pay the rent 
 Dedication baby through and through

 And I know our love's on the line 
 Love's on the line, our love's on the line 
 Love's on the line, our love's on the line

 Love's on the line, our love's on the line 
 Love's on the line, our love's on the line 
 I watch our kids 
 Growin' up, going to school 
 Is there anything else for us now 
 Are we both just fools 
 Wasting our precious time 
 At night we lay in bed 
 But it's like you're not even there 
 There's something real bad 
 Going wrong somewhere 
 Last night I heard you cry 
 And I know our love's on the line 
 Love's on the line, our love's on the line

362,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Your Love,"She promises to be yours forever and always 
 And you're too young to know it don't work out that way 
 When she kisses you and your heart skips 
 And you're ten feet off the ground 
 Soon you'll be crying and that when you'll have found 
 That 
 Your love is gonna let you down, boy 
 Your love is gonna let you down 
 Your love is gonna let you down, boy 
 Your love is gonna let you down 
 Well it's kisses and sweet talk 
 When she first starts coming round 
 But soon tears start falling down 
 You say every day she makes your dreams come true 
 But soon those very dreams will be the death of you 
 Well 
 Your love is gonna let you down, boy 
 Your love is gonna let you down 
 Your love is gonna let you down, boy 
 Your love is gonna let you down 
 No cold denials, no-one really lied 
 It was time spent, promise implied 
 And suddenly you see something new in her eyes 
 And in that moment you realize 
 Lately you've been walking the streets at night 
 Like an empty shadow in the morning light 
 Like an empty shadow that's suddenly found 
 That your love is gonna let you down 
 Your love is gonna let you down, boy 
 Your love is gonna let you down 
 Your love is gonna let you down, boy 
 Your love is gonna let you down"
363,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Achy Breaky Heart,"You can tell the world you never was my girl 
 You can burn my clothes up when I'm gone 
 You can tell your friends just what a fool I've been 
 And laugh and joke about me on the phone 
 You can tell my arms go back to the farm 
 You can tell my feet to hit the floor 
 Or you can tell my lips to tell my fingertips 
 They won't be reaching out for you no more 
 But don't tell my heart 
 My achy breaky heart 
 I just don't think he'd understand 
 And if you tell my heart 
 My achy breaky heart 
 He might blow up and kill this man 
 You can tell your Ma I moved to Arkansas 
 You can tell your dog to bite my leg 
 Or tell your brother Cliff whose fist can tell my lip 
 He never really liked me anyway 
 Or tell your Aunt Louise, tell anything you please 
 Myself already knows I'm not O.K. 
 Or you can tell my eyes to watch out for my mind 
 It might be walking out on me today 
 (Repeat chorus to end)"
364,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Across The Borderline,"(Ry Cooder/John Hiatt/Jim Dickinson) 
 There's a place, so I've been told, 
 Every street is paved with gold 
 And it's just across the borderline 
 And when it's time to take your turn 
 There's a lesson that you must learn 
 You may lose more than you'll ever hope to find. 
 And when you reach that broken promised land 
 And all your dreams slip though your hand 
 You have learned it's too late to change your mind 
 Cause you pay the price to come so far 
 Just to wind up where you are 
 And you're still just across the borderline. 
 Up and down The Rio Grande 
 A thousand foot prints in the sand 
 Reveal a secret no one can define 
 The river rolls on like a breath 
 In between our life and death 
 Tell me who is next to cross that borderline. 
 And when you reach that broken promised land 
 And all your dreams slip though your hand 
 You'll know it's too late to change your mind 
 Cause you pay the price to come so far 
 Just to wind up where you are 
 And you're still just across the borderline."
365,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Action In The Streets,"Well don't move 
 Why don't you listen to what I'm saying 
 And hey you

 Get loose

 Oh tonight 
 There's action in the street all night 
 We're bopping to the big beat, go 
 Get up off your seat and roll 
 At school 
 The girls you know their dancing, mister 's just my speed 
 And hey cool 
 If action is the thing you need 
 Well don't fool 
 The kid's satisfaction guaranteed 
 Oh tonight 
 There's action in the street all night 
 We're bopping to the big beat, go 
 Get up off your seat and roll 
 Well hey man 
 Yeah don't let the little girl sigh 
 Understand 
 If you just move your body side to side 
 Raise your hand 
 Shout until you're satisfied 
 Oh tonight 
 There's action in the street all night 
 We're bopping to the big beat, go 
 Get up off your seat and roll"
366,Bruce Springsteen,rock,A Love So Fine,"(Paradise by the sea) 
 Well there's sparklin' angels on your fire-escape tonight 
 They line them up for you trying to keep you safe 
 But with them fire alley burglars on a midnight vamp 
 You lost your heart on Main Street to a beautiful tramp 
 That's all right, I don't mind 
 'Cause I got (you got) a love so fine 
 A love so fine, me and my baby 
 A love so fine, me and my baby 
 A love so fine 
 The rat's traps are filled with soul crusaders 
 Everybody's popping and hopping and jumping 
 At Little Melvin and The Invaders 
 You're out on the floor and you can't get up 
 Your baby's out there dancing and struttin' that Continental Strut 
 She looks so good, she looks so fine (she blows your mind) 
 Oh we (you) got a love so fine 
 A love so fine 
 A love so fine 
 A love so fine 
 Everybody's reeling when the band hits the ceiling 
 Don't you know you just wanna go 
 The boys start (joint gets) rockin', your knees start knockin' 
 Everybody party, go 
 Let's go 
 The bar's closed down (It's 3 o'clock and the bar's closed) 
 You walk to the shady side of town all alone (Well you walk along with your) 
 Papa's screaming at you, he wants some cash (baby to the dirty side of town) 
 Mama's chewing you (me) off about hanging out with (alley) trash 
 That's all right, oh you don't mind 
 'Cause you've got a love so fine, oh me and my baby 
 A love so fine 
 A love so fine

367,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Angel Eyes,"The angel rides with hunchbacked children, poison oozing from his engine 
 Wieldin' love as a lethal weapon, on his way to hubcap heaven 
 Baseball cards poked in his spokes, his boots in oil he's patiently soaked 
 The roadside attendant nervously jokes as the angel's tires stroke his precious pavement 
 The interstate's choked with nomadic hordes 
 In Volkswagen vans with full running boards 
 Dragging great anchors, followin' dead-end signs into the sores 
 The angel rides by humpin' his hunk metal whore 
 Madison Avenue's claim to fame in a trainer bra with eyes like rain 
 She rubs against the weatherbeaten frame and asks the angel for his name 
 Off in the distance the marble dome reflects across the flatlands with a naked feel off into parts unknown 
 The woman strokes his polished chrome and lies beside the angel's bones"
368,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Bad Moon Rising,"I see a bad moon rising 
 I see troubles on the way 
 I see earthquakes and lightning 
 I see bad times today 
 Don't go 'round tonight 
 Well, it's bound to take your life 
 There's a bad moon on the rise 
 I hear hurricanes a-blowin' 
 I know the end it's coming soon 
 I fear rivers overflowing 
 I hear the voice of rage and ruin 
 Don't go 'round tonight 
 Well, it's bound to take your life 
 There's a bad moon on the rise 
 Hope you got your things together 
 Hope you're quite prepared to die 
 Looks like we're in for nasty weather 
 One eye is taken for an eye 
 Don't go 'round tonight 
 Well, it's bound to take your life 
 There's a bad moon on the rise 
 Don't go 'round tonight 
 Well, it's bound to take your life 
 There's a bad moon on the rise"
369,Bruce Springsteen,rock,The Ballad Of The Architect Angel,"The architect angel held <? > juda ranch. 
 Just a dirty mile down on the borderline. 
 Where he mastered blastin' and hustled young cattle for slaughter 
 And dated juda's daughter. 
 From the cellar aways to the attics and all across the plains 
 Broke electric static of religious strain, 
 And though he was never an addict, he wore scars on his veins. 
 Like a young girl holds her first pimp, he held his Bible in. 
 From desert bars and church bazaars, the hunger slowly came 
 With vulgar faces from vulgar places lookin' for a game. 
 Well, ivory gun handles and chamber grease 
 And souped-up hydroplanes. 
 The bullets burn from tv silver, bearin' great cowboys' names. 
 Now with 14 inches of gun barrel, smokin' from the lid, 
 Spurs on straight black bootheels, he said ""they call me the brooklyn kid."" 
 And in his lonely zenith nightmares, well that's just what they did. 
 Oh, how he played out his scenes, loaded on <? > dreams. 
 Well, his holster slung low like a hot kid-sister 
 Tied back to his leg like he gonna do. 
 He was stompin' the step he called the quickman twister. 
 His six-guns were pumpin' through. 
 His tongue hung low like sawdust scrapin' across the plains. 
 He crawled up outside the juda ranch. 
 And started callin' the angel names. 
 And now the architect angel stood, in one hand a staff, the other a gun. 
 He held the staff high in the wind. the gun was like a piece in the sun. 
 He started howlin' like a monsoon wind. drew fast. the job was done. 
 At night the moon stretched tight light 'cross the plains, 
 As real cowboys sat around real campfire flames, 
 And the county wolf called as if to explain to his son 
 The way the west was won. 
 The west was finally won. 
 The way the west was won."
370,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Blowin' In The Wind,"How many roads must a man walk down 
 Before you call him a man? 
 Yes, 'n' how many seas must a white dove sail 
 Before she sleeps in the sand? 
 Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly 
 Before they're forever banned? 
 The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind, 
 The answer is blowin' in the wind. 
 How many times must a man look up 
 Before he can see the sky? 
 Yes, 'n' how many ears must one man have 
 Before he can hear people cry? 
 Yes, 'n' how many deaths will it take till he knows 
 That too many people have died? 
 The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind, 
 The answer is blowin' in the wind. 
 How many years can a mountain exist 
 Before it is washed to the sea 
 Yes, 'n' how many years can some people exist 
 Before they're allowed to be free? 
 Yes, 'n' how many times can a man turn his head, 
 Pretending he just doesn't see? 
 The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind, 
 The answer is blowin' in the wind."

 Bless on the border guard so cold and alone 
 Bless on the child so far from his home 
 Pity the border guard who feels like a woman to cry 
 Pity the border guard whose life guards the line 
 A light is a funny thing 
 A border sometime 
 A light is a hurting thing 
 Use only to divine 
 I pity the refugee whose home lies behind 
 I pity the border guard and his border line 
 He keeps his machine gun nose pointed to the sky 
 The night time is his master 
 And you know the dawn light brings his captor 
 And I pity the border guard as he walks, well as he walks his own 
 The echo of his foot steps is all a friend would know 
 A home is a funny thing 
 You get tied to the earth 
 Like a love is a crazy thing 
 In the eye of a child 
 I Pity the border guard whose soul taken captive at birth 
 May the sweet brace of his grief and show him how to be so wild 
 Yes a light is a funny thing 
 A border sometimes 
 A light is a hurting thing 
 Used only to divine 
 He who made the open plains and the world one and all 
 Could not have conceived with a barbed wire brain 
 For the building of the wall and at night I keep my fire bright 
 So that I may be safe when I sleep 
 Till I wake on that wonderful morning with no more light well ooh"

 Our work contract's out and we have to move on 
 Six hundred miles to the Mexican border 
 They chase us like rustlers, like outlaws, like thieves. 
 We died in your hills. we died on your deserts. 
 We've died in your mountains, and died on your plains. 
 We've died 'neath your trees, and we've died in your bushes. 
 Both sides of the river, we've died just the same. 
 Good-bye to my juan, good-bye rosalita

 You won't have a name when you ride the big airplane 
 And all they will call you will be ""deportee"" 
 The skyplane caught fire over los gatos canyon 
 A fireball of lightning that shook all our hills 
 Who were all these dear friends all scattered like dry leaves? 
 The radio says they were just deportees. 
 Is this the best way we can grow our big orchards? 
 And is this the best way we can grow our good fruit? 
 To fall like dry leaves and rot on the top soil, 
 And be known by no name except ""deportee"".

 Rosalita, jump a little higher 
 Senorita, come sit by my fire 
 I just want to be your lover, ain't no liar 
 Rosalita, you're my stone desire 
 Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knee Willie, don't you know they're gonna be there 
 Sloppy Sue and Big Bone Billy, they'll be coming up for air 
 We're gonna play some pool, skip some school 
 Act real cool, stay out all night, it's gonna feel all right 
 So Rosie, come out tonight, little baby, come out tonight 
 Windows are for cheaters, chimneys for the poor 
 Closets are for hangers, winners use the door 
 So use it, Rosie, that's what it's there for 
 Now, I know your mama, she don't like me, 'cause I play in a rock and roll band 
 And I know your daddy, he don't dig me, but he never did understand 
 Your papa lowered the boom, he locked you in your room-- I'm comin' to lend a hand 
 I'm comin' to liberate you, confiscate you, I want to be your man 
 Someday we'll look back on this and it will all seem funny 
 But now you're sad, your mama's mad 
 And your papa says he knows that I don't have any money 
 Your papa says he knows that I don't have any money 
 Oh, your daddy says he knows that I don't have any money 
 Well, tell him this is his last chance to get his daughter in a fine romance 
 'Cause a record company, Rosie, just gave me a big advance 
 And my tires were slashed and I almost crashed, but the Lord had mercy 
 And my machine, she's a dud, out stuck in the mud somewhere in the swamps of Jersey 
 Well, hold on tight, stay up all night, 'cause Rosie, I'm comin' on strong 
 By the time we meet the morning light, I will hold you in my arms 
 I know a pretty little place in Southern California, down San Diego way 
 There's a little cafe, where they play guitars all night and day 
 You can hear them in the back room strummin' 
 So hold tight, baby, 'cause don't you know Daddy's comin' 
 Everybody sing 
 Rosalita, jump a little higher 
 Senorita, come sit by my fire 
 I just want to be your lover, ain't no liar 
 Oh Rosie, you're my stone desire 
 Hey hey hey hey 
 Hey hey hey hey 
 Hey hey hey hey 
 Hey hey hey hey"
382,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Heartbreak Hotel,"Since my baby left me 
 I found a new place to dwell 
 Down at the end of Lonely street at Heartbreak Hotel 
 I get so lonely baby 
 I get so lonely 
 I get so lonely I could die 
 Although it's always crowded 
 I still can find some room 
 Where those broken hearted lovers 
 Cry away their gloom, oh! 
 I get so lonely 
 I get so lonely 
 Get so lonely I could die 
 Bellhop's tears keep flowing 
 Desk clerk dressed in black 
 They been so long on lonely street 
 They ain't never comin' back 
 I get so lonely 
 I get so lonely 
 Get so lonely I could die 
 If your baby leaves you 
 And you have a tale to tell 
 Just take a walk 
 Down Lonely street to Heartbreak Hotel 
 I get so lonely baby 
 I get so lonely 
 I get so lonely I could die"
383,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Heart Full Of Soul,"Sick at heart and lonely 
 Deep in dark despair 
 Thinking one thought only 
 Where is she, tell me where 
 And if she says to you 
 She don't love me 
 Just give here my message 
 Tell her of my plea 
 And I know, if she had me back again 
 I would never make her sad 
 I got a heart... full of soul 
 And I know... 
 She's been gone such a long time 
 Longer than I can bear 
 But if she says she wants me 
 Tell her that I'll be there 
 And if she says to you 
 She don't love me 
 Just give her my message 
 Tell her my plea 
 And I know..."
384,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Highway 61 Revisited,"Oh God said to Abraham, ""Kill me a son"" 
 Abe says, ""Man, you must be putting me on"" 
 God say, ""No"". Abe say, ""What?"" 
 God say, ""You can do what you want Abe, but 
 The next time you see me comin' you better run"" 
 Well Abe says, ""Where do you want this killing done?"" 
 God says, ""Out on Highway 61"". 
 Well Georgia Sam he had a bloody nose 
 Welfare Department they wouldn't give him no clothes 
 He asked poor Howard where can I go 
 Howard said there's only one place I know 
 Sam said tell me quick man I got to run 
 Ol' Howard just pointed with his gun 
 And said that way down on Highway 61. 
 Well Mack the Finger said to Louie the King 
 I got forty red white and blue shoe strings 
 And a thousand telephones that don't ring 
 Do you know where I can get rid of these things 
 And Louie the King said let me think for a minute son 
 And he said yes I think it can be easily done 
 Just take everything down to Highway 61. 
 Now the fifth daughter on the twelfth night 
 Told the first father that things weren't right 
 My complexion she said is much too white 
 He said come here and step into the light he says hmm you're right 
 Let me tell the second mother this has been done 
 But the second mother was with the seventh son 
 And they were both out on Highway 61. 
 Now the rovin' gambler he was very bored 
 He was tryin' to create a next world war 
 He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor 
 He said I never engaged in this kind of thing before 
 But yes I think it can be very easily done 
 We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun 
 And have it on Highway 61."
385,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Hold On,"I worked hard, baby, night and day 
 The things I had somebody took away 
 They took away everything I earned 
 But there's one lesson that'a I have learned 
 You got to hold on, little girl, to what you've got (4x) 
 I been pushed and I been knocked down 
 But I picked myself right back up off the ground 
 And baby there's one thing that I have found 
 Fighting's the only way's to stand your ground 
 You got to hold on, little girl, to what you've got (4x) 
 I've been used, I've been abused 
 I've had, baby, my regrets 
 I've been lost, I paid the cost 
 But there's one thing I ain't gonna forget 
 I've heard some hard lines, I've seen some cryin' times 
 Bad luck and trouble they been friends of mine 
 Got to stand straight and stare right at your face (fate?) 
 And play it hard before it's too late 
 You got to hold on, little girl, to what you've got (8x)"
386,Bruce Springsteen,rock,I'm A Coward,"I ain't afraid of no lions 
 I ain't afraid of no grizzly bear 
 I got in a wrestlin' match with old king kong 
 He didn't even muss my hair 
 There's just one thing in the whole wide world 
 That make me doubt my stuff 
 I'm a coward when it comes to love 
 Now bring down old hulk hogan 
 King kong bundy too 
 Bring down old big mike tyson 
 I'll show them what a real man can do 
 They say the tougher' get goin' 
 Now baby that's when the goin' get tough 
 But I'm a coward when it comes to love 
 I'm a coward when it comes to love 
 I'm a coward when it comes to love 
 You can bring on a different sexy girl 
 At every night of the week 
 Buddy that's okay 
 But I start tremblin', my knees get weak 
 Whenever I hear her say 
 ""Do you love me baby? "" 
 ""Do you love me baby? "" 
 ""Do you love me baby? "" 
 I got a muscle of iron 
 I got another muscle made of steel 
 But when we start kissin' 'n' huggin' 
 You may be the bravest man in the whole wide world 
 But buddy, that ain't enough 
 I'm a coward when it comes to love 
 I'm a coward when it comes to love 
 I'm a coward when it comes to love"
387,Bruce Springsteen,rock,In Freehold,"I was born right here on Randolph Street in Freehold 
 Here, right behind that big red maple in Freehold 
 Well, I went to school right here, got laid, and had my first beer in Freehold 
 Well, my folks both lived and worked right here in Freehold 
 I remember running up the street past the convent and church here in Freehold 
 Chased my daddy down in these bars, first fell in love with this guitar 
 Here in Freehold 
 Well, I had my first kiss at the YMCA canteen on Friday night 
 Maria Espinosa, tell me, where are you tonight 
 You were 13 but way ahead of your time, I walked home with a limp but I felt 
 Fine that night in Freehold 
 Well, the girls at Freehold Regional they looked pretty fine 
 Had my heart broke at least a half dozen times 
 I wonder if they miss me, if they still get the itch 
 If they'd dump me if they knew I'd strike it rich 
 Straight out of Freehold 
 Well, Tex rest in peace, and Marion gave us kids a hand in Freehold 
 George and I started up a little rock and roll band in Freehold 
 Well, we learned pretty quick how to rock, I'll never forget the feeling 
 Of that first 5 bucks in my pocket that I earned in Freehold 
 I got outta here really hard and fast in Freehold 
 Everyone wanted to kick my ass back there in Freehold 
 Well, if you were different, black or brown 
 It was a bit of a redneck town back then in Freehold 
 Well, something broke my daddy's back in Freehold 
 In '69 he left and he never come back to Freehold 
 Said, once he drove to California, 3000 miles in 3 days 
 Called my relatives some dirty names and drove straight out of Freehold 
 My sister had her first little baby at 17 in Freehold 
 Well, people they can be pretty mean 
 Honey, you had a rough road to go, but you ain't made of nothin' but soul 
 I love you more than you'll ever know 
 We both survived Freehold 
 Well, my buddy Mike, he's the mayor now in Freehold 
 I remember when we used to have a lot more hair in Freehold 
 Well, I left and swore I'd never walk these streets again, Jack 
 Tonight all I can say is, holy shit I'm back, back in Freehold 
 Well, this summer everything was green in Freehold 
 Rode my kids on the fire engine through the streets of Freehold 
 I showed 'em where Daddy was born and raised, and first felt the sun on his face 
 There in Freehold 
 I still got a lot of good friends right here in town 
 I can usually find me a free beer somewhere, with offers of free meals I am blessed 
 Should I go crazy, blow all my money and ruin my life 
 Well at least I'll never go hungry, I guess, here in Freehold 
 Well, I got a good Catholic education here in Freehold 
 Led to an awful lot of masturbation here in Freehold 
 Father, it was just something I did for a smile 
 Hell, I still get a good one off once in a while 
 And dedicate it to Freehold 
 Don't get me wrong, I ain't puttin' nobody down 
 Hell, in the end it all just goes and comes around 
 It's one hell of a town 
 Freehold"

390,Bruce Springsteen,rock,It's The Little Things That Count,"She said we could just sleep together, 
 There'd be nothing wrong. 
 We could just hold each other with our clothes on. 
 I went to answer, I don't think we should. 
 Then I heard a voice say, yeah, I guess we could. 
 She kissed me lightly and said you know sometimes when you're down, 
 It's the little things that count 
 It's the little things that count 
 It's the little things... 
 She said it was too late, I really shouldn't try to drive. 
 She unbuttoned my shirt and whispered just close your eyes. 
 Here, let me take your boots off, you know sometimes when your luck's run out 
 It's the little things that count 
 It's the little things that count 
 It's the little things... 
 Bridge: Her dress rode lightly as she walked 
 Then she pulled the covers down. 
 (Harmonica break) 
 Well I was so dry, she held a water glass to my lips, 
 And the polish on her nail was chipped. 
 She said she had a boyfriend that I reminded her of. 
 His hair was the same muddy brown; she stuck her tongue in my mouth..."
391,Bruce Springsteen,rock,I Want You,"The guilty undertaker sighs 
 The lonesome organ grinder cries 
 The silver saxophone says 
 I should refuse you 
 The cracked bells and washed out horns 
 Blow into my face with scorn 
 But it's not that way 
 I wasn't born to lose you 
 I want you I want you 
 I want you so bad 
 Honey I want you 
 The drunken politician leaps 
 Upon the streets where mothers weep 
 And the saviors who are fast asleep 
 They wait for you 
 And I wait for them to interrupt 
 Me drinking from my broken cup 
 And ask me to open up 
 The gate for you 
 Now all my fathers 
 They've gone down 
 True love 
 They've been without it 
 But all their daughters 
 Put me down 
 'Cause I don't 
 Think about it 
 Well I return to the queen of spades 
 And talk with my chamber maid 
 She knows that I'm not afraid to 
 Look at her 
 She is good to me and there's 
 Nothing she doesn't see 
 She knows where I'd like to be 
 But it doesn't matter 
 Now your dancing child with the Chinese suit 
 He spoke to me I took his flute 
 No I wasn't very cute to him 
 Was I 
 But I did it because he lied 
 Because he took you for a ride 
 And because time was on his side 
 And because I 
 Want you I want you 
 I want you so bad 
 Honey I want you"

393,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Like A Rolling Stone,"Once upon a time you dressed so fine 
 You threw the bums a dime in your prime 
 Didn't you 
 People called say beware doll 
 You're bound to fall 
 You thought they were all 
 Kidding you 
 You used to laugh about 
 Everybody that was hanging it out 
 Now you don't talk so loud 
 Now you don't seem so proud 
 About having to be scrounging 
 For your next meal 
 How does it feel 
 How does it feel 
 To be without a home 
 Like a complete unknown 
 Like a rolling stone 
 You've gone to the finest school 
 All right miss lonely 
 But you know you only used to get 
 Juiced in it 
 Nobody's ever taught you 
 How to live in the street 
 And now you're gonna have to get 
 Used to it 
 You say you never compromise 
 With the mystery tramp 
 But now you realize 
 He's not selling any alibis 
 As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes 
 And say do you want to do 
 Make a deal 
 How does it feel 
 How does it feel 
 To be on your homewith no direction home 
 A complete unknown 
 Like a rolling stone 
 You never turned around to see the frowns 
 On the jugglers and the clowns 
 When they all did tricks for you 
 You never understood that it ain't no good 
 You shouldn't let other people 
 Get your kicks for you 
 You used to ride on the chrome horse 
 With your diplomat 
 Who carried on his shoulder a siamese cat 
 Ain't it hard when you discover that 
 He really wasn't where it's at 
 After he took from you everything 
 He could steal 
 How does it feel 
 How does it feel 
 To hang on your home 
 With no direction home 
 Like a complete unknown 
 Like a rolling stone 
 Princess on the steeple 
 And all the pretty people 
 They're drinking thinking 
 That they got it made 
 Exchanging all precious gifts 
 But you'd better 
 Take a diamond ring 
 You'd better pawn it babe 
 You used to be so amused 
 At napoleon in rags 
 And the language that he used 
 Go to him now he calls you 
 You can't refuse 
 When you ain't got nothing 
 You got nothing to lose 
 You are invisible nowyou got no secrets to conceal 
 How does it feel 
 How does it feel 
 To be on your home 
 With no direction home 
 Like a complete unknown 
 Like a rolling stone"

 And dance on it's grave 
 Dance on his grave

 My daddy was a stranger 
 Lived in a hotel downtown 
 When I was a kid 
 He was just somebody I'd see around 
 Somebody I'd see around

 That your mistakes would be your own 
 Your sins would be your own

 A long time coming my dear 
 But now it's here 
 I am laying under the arms of Cassiopeia 
 The sword of Orion sweeps 
 It's me and you Rosie 
 Crackling like crossed wires 
 I listen to you breathing in your sleep 
 The sparks of the fire are left burning 
 Lie 2 kids in sleeping bags 
 I reach under your shirt and feel your belly 
 There's another one kicking inside 
 I promise I ain't going to fuck it up this time"

 But I can't seem to find my way over 
 Wandering, I'm lost 
 As I travel along the white cliffs of Dover 
 Many rivers to cross 
 And it's only my will that keeps me alive. 
 I've been hurt, washed up for years 
 But I mearly survive because of my pride 
 And this loneliness won't leave me alone, 
 It's such a drag to be on your own 
 My baby left, and she wouldn't say why, 
 Now all I do is cry... 
 I've got many rivers to cross 
 And it's only my will that keeps me alive 
 I've got so many rivers to cross, 
 Oh, so many rivers to cross..."

398,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Pilgrim In The Temple Of Love,"It was Christmas Eve, I was standin' in the parking lot 
 Of ""Fabulous Girls, Nude - Nude - Nude"" 
 In the car next to me there was a young lady givin' a blow-job 
 To a man in a Santa Claus suit 
 His beard was crooked, his hat askew 
 Embarrassed, I turned to go 
 When from the back seat of that Mazda I heard somebody shout ""Oh Baby, don't 
 Stop"" 
 And a merry ""Ho-ho-ho"" 
 When I walked inside, I ordered a beer and a double shot of whisk 
 And in three minutes I had fallen in love 
 The DJ announced ""Ladies and gentlemen, from Forth Worth, Texas: Lady Godiva"" 
 And I sat and worshipped 'neath the angel above 
 At the end of her set she brushed her hair 
 Came and sat on the stool to my right 
 And said ""Will you buy me a drink?"" 
 My heart beats fast, my trousers grew tight 
 And wittily I replied ""Uh..."" 
 She showed me a picture of her kid 
 Said during the day she's an art student 
 She dances six nights a week for slobs and idiots like this 
 Of course, present company excluded. 
 On Donner, on Dancer, on Comet, on Blitzen 
 I'm lost in the valley of the supervixens 
 Worshippin' at the feet of the goddess above 
 I'm a pilgrim in the temple of love, ma, just a pilgrim in the temple 
 Of love 
 Well then Santa came stumblin' in, and somebody shouted 
 ""Hey Santa, where's your elves?"" 
 He sat down on the stool to my left 
 And the bartender took a vodka bottle of the shelf 
 He asked if Mrs. Claus had called 
 To tell her he worked on the late shift at the mall 
 And he was sorry, but he just got through 
 I turned and I asked him: 
 ""How's the kid this year, Santa?"" 
 Beneath his breath he whispered ""A merry fuck you"" 
 Well then the owner come over and he was a short gfat ugly guy 
 With a funny kind of pushed-in face 
 He shook my hand and said it was the first time 
 They'd ever had a real superstar in this place 
 Lady Godiva bought me a few drinks 
 And words came out of my mouth 
 What they were, I couldn't guess 
 But it was something about showgirls, lapdancing, motley crue 
 You can guess the rest 
 Well I walked outside, snow was falling 
 I had some toys to put together - it was Christmas time 
 Santa followed me into the parking lot 
 And threw up on the hood of the car next to mine 
 I gave him my handkerchief, pulled out onto the highway 
 And as I sat at the light 
 I swear I saw a sleigh with a dozen of reindeers 
 Pull up out of the parking lot and cut across the mall 
 And a voice shouted ""Merry Christmas to all you assholes 
 And to all a good fucking night!"""
399,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Purple Rain,"I never meant to cause you any sorrow 
 I never meant to cause you any pain 
 I only wanted to one time to see you laughing 
 I only wanted to see you 
 Laughing in the purple rain 
 Purple rain, purple rain 
 Purple rain, purple rain 
 Purple rain, purple rain 
 I only wanted to see you 
 Bathing in the purple rain 
 I never wanted to be your weekend lover 
 I only wanted to be some kind of friend 
 Baby, I could never steal you from another 
 It's such a shame our friendship had to end 
 Purple rain, purple rain 
 Purple rain, purple rain 
 Purple rain, purple rain 
 I only wanted to see you 
 Underneath the purple rain 
 Honey, I know, I know 
 I know times are changing 
 It's time we all reach out 
 For something new, that means you too 
 You say you want a leader 
 But you can't seem to make up your mind 
 I think you better close it 
 And let me guide you darling to the purple rain 
 Purple rain, purple rain 
 Purple rain, purple rain 
 Purple rain, purple rain 
 I only wanted to see you 
 Underneath the purple rain"

402,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Sell It And They Will Come,"I fell asleep on the couch last night, woke up with the TV on. 
 There was a woman in tight cotton exercise shorts 
 And a big plastic machine she was climbing on. 
 She said ""The Abacycle guarantees ten inches off your waist, 
 And 50 pounds in just 3 minutes a day."" 
 I went to bed knowing the revolution had been postponed 
 And everything was OK. 
 You can buy it, you can try it, go right ahead. 
 But don't be fooled folks, there's only one. 
 I forget the guy's name but I know somebody must have said 
 Sell it and they will come boys, sell it and they will come. 
 I switched the channels and there was Evel Knievel, I thought that he was 
 Dead. 
 I found myself sitting there quietly, hanging on every word he said. 
 ""Now folks, the Stimulator removes all pain from your life. 
 And the best day of your life will be when you try this little thing out."" 
 The camera moved in as he said, ""Now let me tell you ladies and gentlemen, 
 Pain is something old Evel knows a little about"" 
 You can buy it, you can try it, that's what I said. 
 But don't be fooled folks, there's only one. 
 I forget that guy's name but I know somebody must have said 
 Sell it and they will come boys, sell it and they will come. 
 And a fellow comes on shouting ""Free haircuts for life!"", 
 Somehow you cut your hair with a vacuum cleaner. 
 And then I switched the channels and there was Dionne Warwick, communing 
 With her psychic friends. 
 I watched for hours, taking warmth, comfort, 
 And pleasure in the things that I despise. 
 Touched by how much they needed me, and that gleeful desperation in their 
 Eyes. 
 You can buy it, you can try it, it'll help you in bed. 
 But don't be fooled folks, there's only one. 
 I forget that guy's name but I know somebody said 
 Sell it and they will come boys, sell it and they will come. 
 So Dionne, Cher, and all my late-night friends, I drink to your health. 
 And Tony Little, America's personal trainer, please kill yourself. 
 Now I've sold a few things myself in my time, and by the way folks, 
 There's some t-shirts on your way outside. 
 Well last night I dreamed of lipstick and tight little cotton shorts 
 ""Harder, faster"", she breathed. 
 ""One, two, three, four, five"" 
 Ride, Sally ride, girl, ride Sally ride. 
 You can buy it, you can try it, it'll help you in bed. 
 But don't be fooled folks, there's only one. 
 I forget that guy's name but somebody said 
 Sell it and they will come boys, sell it and they will come."
403,Bruce Springsteen,rock,She's So Fine,"Hey baby 
 Well she's vicious as a razor 
 Resting on your mainline 
 She's brutal as an ace 
 Laid on the table at just the right time 
 She's like a devil-woman 
 But she's locked in over-drive 
 Her eyes are cold stone 
 But she's backed by a power-glide 
 She's sweet, she's educated 
 She knows about history, geometry 
 She's so fine 
 Oh she says I ain't got the love 
 I ain't got the time 
 Ain't gonna give you no kiss 
 Ain't gonna hand ya 
 All I want's a ride, Sweet William 
 All I want's a ride 
 And it's oh baby, oh baby 
 Won't you come, don't you wanna go for a ride? 
 I'll get in my car and burn it up 
 Now switch on the radio and turn it up 
 And we're gonna be burning down a straight load 
 I want some love and I got to truck along 
 Well she's vicious as a razor 
 Resting on your mainline 
 She's brutal as an ace 
 Laid on the table at just the right time 
 She's like a devil-woman 
 But she's locked in over-drive 
 Her eyes are cold stone 
 But she's backed by a power-glide 
 She's so educated 
 She's got a nice mama, she got a nice pop 
 She's so fine 
 Oh and the boys say she swings a silver rodThe kids call her angel 
 Some kids call her god down on Lover's Lane 
 Be my baby 
 Won't you be my lover 
 Come on baby 
 I said hey baby"
404,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Spanish Harlem,"There is a rose in Spanish Harlem 
 A rose that grows in Spanish Harlem 
 It's never seen the sun 
 It only comes up when the moon is on the run 
 And all the stars are leaving 
 Well, it grows right in the street 
 Up between the concrete 
 But soft and sweet, and (breathing??) 
 There is a rose in Spanish Harlem 
 A rose that grows in Spanish Harlem 
 Oh, with eyes as black as coal 
 That reach down in my soul 
 And start a fire I can't control 
 I beg your pardon 
 Well, I want to pick that rose 
 And watch her as she grows 
 In my garden 
 There is a rose in Spanish Harlem 
 There is a rose in Spanish Harlem"
405,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Sugarland,"They're grazin' the field 
 Covered with tar 
 Can't get a price 
 To see my way clear 
 I'm sitting down 
 At the Sugarland Bar 
 It might as well bury 
 My body right here 
 Tractors and combines 
 Out in the cold 
 Sheds piled high 
 With the wheat we ain't sold 
 Silos filled with 
 Last year's crops 
 If something don't break me 
 We'll gonna drop 
 Well my wife got another 
 Coming in July 
 She's just laid up in bed 
 All she does is cries, cries, cries 
 Tommy, oh Tommy 
 I'm so alone 
 Tommy, oh Tommy 
 Oh! Won't you stay home 
 Pa' don't say nothing 
 Except when it rains 
 He sits by the window 
 Listening to the sound of passing trains 
 Roaring out of the night 
 Carrying an empty load 
 We got a whole lot of grain 
 That ain't got nowhere to go 
 Well, if prices 
 Don't get no higher 
 I'll fill this dustbin with gasAnd set these fields on fire 
 Sit out on a ridge 
 Where the bluebirds fly 
 And watch the flame rise up 
 Against this sugarland sky"
406,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Sweet Soul Music,"Do you like good music? 
 Sweet soul music? 
 How must I strike her 
 Sometime

407,Bruce Springsteen,rock,There Will Never Be Another For Me But You,"Princess di did find another man 
 Prince charles may want to live as a tampon in another woman's 
 Underpants 
 I know what he feels like 
 I've been there too 
 But there'll never be any other for me but you 
 Will elizibeth taylor get married again? buddy, that's the question 
 Poor larry fortenski got busted on his harly for illegal weapons 
 Possession 
 I've been that down, I've been that crazy 
 I've been that much of a fool 
 But there'll never be any other for me but you 
 Man, a love that's real 
 Is a love that's hard 
 Like a pit bull on your ass, in a very small back yard 
 A love that's hard can be a love that's true 
 But I swear there'll never be any other for me but you 
 Elvis and priscilla 
 Jim baker and tammy fay

408,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Tokyo,"The moon hung like a shadow on a rung over Shanghai 
 And the soldier boys were returning home screaming ""Bonzai!"" 
 And the kids are still playing their games, 
 Getting hustled and rustled out in the rain 
 As I sat inside listening to the broadcast. 
 Oh save my soul sweet rock and roll 'cause I'm sinking fast. 
 And then the band played. 
 (Out of nowhere) 
 (Everybody) 
 (Everybody) 
 Well now the legendary chaplain of the fighting 51st 
 Was getting ready to go. 
 I said ""Padre do you know a cheap virgin who likes to tango?"" 
 He said ""You can try Linda Lee; 
 Around the corner and across the sea. 
 Oh word is out, word is out she's fast."" 
 Oh blow me down now Linda, 'cause I'm sinking fast. 
 Yes and them cats are sure getting fat down in the trainyard. 
 And the sandman brings them dreams they ship out in boxcars. 
 The union says hold; break out the dice, break out the gold. 
 It's lunchtime at last. 
 And old big mama said George Raff's tonight on the late show. 
 She sits straddling the kitchen chair really gung-ho 
 She shivers with chills, wet with slotcar thrills 
 Hypnotically lost in the glass 
 And we all sighed... 
 With the sunrise 
 As we watched the credits pass. 
 And the little blue dot went away. 
 And then the morning cloak fell down like a hoax over sleepytown 
 And garbage truck Big Lenny's out drinking the last round 
 He hurriedly sipped his beer, and poking fun of the queer 
 And threatened to kick his ass. 
 And the bell rang 
 And the horn blows 
 And he's outside pumping gas 
 But things were moving so slow tonight 
 So the kid goes back inside the station 
 And turns on the radio to his local AM station 
 And the band played 
 Right on the radio 
 It's on the radio 
 And he listened to the bass line 
 And the boys in the band sang 
 Whoa, whoa whoa-wo 
 Whoa, whoa whoa-wo 
 (They're so excited about it) 
 Whoa, whoa whoa-wo 
 (Everybody all right) 
 Whoa, whoa whoa-wo 
 (And the band played) 
 Whoa, whoa whoa-wo 
 (And the band played) 
 Whoa, whoa whoa-wo 
 (Everybody) 
 Whoa, whoa whoa-wo"

 I hear the music rocking everywhere 
 When you dance 
 I see the lights shining through your hair 
 When you dance 
 The band is blowing like a hurricane 
 When you dance 
 You look so fine but you don't know my name 
 Come near baby, don't be afraid 
 Just one taste won't do 
 I can't hold back one more day 
 Sugar I know I got to dance with you 
 When you dance 
 Your smile ain't hiding what you're thinking of 
 When you dance 
 Your body trembles like you're making love 
 When you move, baby 
 My soul is aching and my blood runs hot 
 Run into me now 
 My heart is breaking, shaking what you got 
 Come near baby, don't be afraid 
 Just one taste won't do 
 I can't hold back one more day 
 Sugar I know I got to dance with you 
 Shake 'em down now 
 Come near baby, don't be afraid 
 Just one taste won't do 
 I can't hold back one more day

410,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Who'll Stop The Rain,"Long as I remember 
 The rain been falling down 
 Clouds of myst'ry pourin' 
 Confusion on the ground 
 Good men through the ages 
 They try to find the sun 
 But I wonder, still I wonder 
 Who'll stop the rain 
 I went down Virginia 
 Seekin' shelter from the storm 
 Just caught up in the fable 
 I watched the tower grow 
 Five-year plan and new deals 
 Wrapped in golden chains 
 Still I wonder, yes I wonder 
 Who'll stop the rain 
 Heard the singers playin' 
 How we cheered for more 
 The crowd had rushed together 
 Tryin' to keep warm 
 Still the rain keeps falling 
 Fallin' through the years 
 And I wonder, still I wonder 
 Who'll stop the rain 
 I wanna know, baby I wanna know"

 I just can't face myself alone (in that mirror) again tonight

 You know you drive me crazy 
 You mean so much to me, baby

 All you little pretty things better learn to sleep alone tonight 
 It was down in the cool dirty living 
 With the man with the master plan 
 Some girl who can beg forgiveness 
 And a ticket to the promised land 
 Down where they'll tear your guts out 
 Making out what you're all about 
 Making while we were blasting like a ? ?

 Want out to the outside 
 Well I'm a small fool 
 I want to shout I'm bound for nothing 
 I want to shout about something too

416,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Chevrolet Deluxe,"I had a wife and kid, and I tried to settle down 
 I just wanted to live an honest life on the edge of an honest town. 
 But in the end they left me danglin' danglin (in the night?) 
 And I went crazy tryin', tryin' to walk that thin line. 
 Oh Chevrolet Deluxe, I bought you with all your accessories, 
 Oh Chevrolet Deluxe, I bought you with all your accessories, 
 But mister, I can't keep my payments up 
 I lie awake at night and wonder if I'm tough enough 
 To win back the hand of Chevrolet Deluxe. 
 ... 
 They shut the power off down at the mill (the count the third time?) 
 And these days when you ride down Main Street 
 It's just whitewashed windows and vacancy signs 
 Did you ever think till the end your kids you would never believe 
 That if you would leave this old town, that it would leave me. 
 My brother's down in Ft Bragg, been there for half a year 
 Man he just got into too much trouble around here. 
 Chevrolet Deluxe, I bought her with all the accessories, 
 But mister, I can't keep those payments up 
 Chevrolet Deluxe, I lost my heart, I lost my guts... 
 ... 
 She was sittin' down at Highway Chevrolet out on Route 3 
 She was lookin'g like she was waitin' just for me 
 I worked all summer long and I saved my money up 
 And I went down and I put that money down 
 In the fall, Billy, (...?) 
 I drove him down rode down together down to Fort Bragg 
 In the years that he was gone (...?) 
 (...?) In the refinery (...?) go along 
 Chevrolet Deluxe, I bought her with all the accessories, 
 (...?) 
 Another year end gone, and Billy he came home 
 (...?) 
 But it was like all of a sudden there was a curse 
 Things got band and things got worse 
 Hmmm... went the power there down at the mill 
 Hmmm... the thrill when they shut the power down at the mill 
 (...?) 
 Chevrolet Deluxe, I bought her with all the accessories, 
 But I can't keep those payments up 
 Chevrolet Deluxe 
 (...?) You were so clear to see 
 Now when I wake in the mornging I don't know what's happening to me 
 Chevrolet Deluxe, I bought her with all the accessories, 
 Mister I can't keep those payments up 
 Chevrolet Deluxe you let me down took the heart right out of me 
 I saw her when I was 17 down at Hansen's Chevrolet 
 I made up my mind to get her any how, any way. 
 That whole summer I worked until I had enough 
 Then I went and put my money down on that Chevrolet Deluxe. 
 Chevrolet Deluxe, I bought her with all the accessories, 
 But mister, I can't keep those payments up 
 Chevrolet Deluxe, I lost my heart, she took my gut... 
 It don't matter what you want, it don't matter what you say, 
 Are you tough enough not to play the way they play."

 I ate it all in bed 
 I asked her what she put in it 
 And this is what she said 
 ""Oh, chicken lips and lizard hips 
 And alligator eyes 
 Monkey legs and buzzard eggs 
 And salamander thighs 
 Rabbit ears and camel rears 
 And tasty toenail pies 
 Stir 'em all together 
 And it's mama's soup surprise"" 
 I went into the bathroom 
 And I stood beside the sink 
 I said, ""I'm feeling slightly ill 
 And I think I'd like a drink"" 
 Mama said, ""I've just the thing 
 I'll get it in a wink 
 It's full of lots of protein 
 And vitamins, I think"" 
 ""Oh, chicken lips and lizard hips 
 And alligator eyes

 And salamander thighs

 And tasty toenail pies 
 Stir 'em all together

418,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Child Bride,"A lovely, poignant song 
 About a man fated to be kept apart from his true love 
 ""Well, sometimes I dream of gettin' outta here, 
 Headin' down towards them old tracks 
 I swore I'd come and get her 
 But I know I ain't never goin' back 
 ""There's nights I can't sleep 
 No matter how hard I try 
 So from my window I watch the moonlight 
 Fall on the far hillside 
 ""I imagine I put on my jacket, 
 Go down to this little roadside bar 
 Pick a stranger and spin around the dance floor 
 To a Mexican guitar"""
419,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Club Soul City,"Pack up your bags

 But they got a place down there that's just for you 
 Club Soul, Club Soul City, yeah yeah yeah 
 Club Soul, Club Soul City, oh yeah 
 There's a waitress at the back bar 
 Goes with the the guy that runs the place

 She's seen a lot of guys like you coming around 
 Looking for something that they've lost 
 Or trying to lose something that they've found 
 Down at

 In there with them 
 Oh don't make us some little girl's dream 
 That can not ever really ever come true 
 Baby don't do it to me 
 I won't do it to you

 You dream and take the boy's home

 ---------To see the late late show

 ---Make you cry like you do girl 
 Now every night you go out looking 
 For true love's satisfaction 
 But in the morning you always end up 
 Settling for just lights, camera, action 
 In another cameo role 
 With some bit play you're befriending 
 You're gonna go broken hearted 
 Looking for that happy ending 
 Well girl you're gonna you're gonna end up 
 Just another lonely ticket sold 
 Crying alone in the theater 
 At the end of the show

 On the other side of the street. 
 Yeah, the light on your portrait and the light in your face 
 And you'll be looking for another pretty place 
 Baby, this side of the street. 
 Well, keep dreaming baby that your desire brings and girl 
 I know the sadness that you find in things, it's true 
 Well, baby if you can't take the heat, what can I do? 
 Well, you and your poetry and your boku (?!) world 
 Behind the face you hide the face of a modern girl 
 On the other side of the street. 
 Yeah, you've got the look as if you owe the world 
 Therefore, you go out there and say what you can earn 
 On the wrong side of the street. 
 Well, you tire of every day bringing the same and so you 
 Go out looking for some strange new games 
 Well, pretty soon you don't know the score anymore. 
 All right now... (guitar break) 
 I know the danger that your desire brings 
 And I know the strangeness that you'll find 
 Wait and it will seem straighter for you and for me. 
 Well, turn on the end and baby turn off the lamps 
 There'll be an end darling to this endless night 
 On the other side of the street. 
 Yeah, and everyday - well- it just brings the same 
 You started looking for some very strange new games 
 On the wrong side of the street. 
 Well, you and your desires lead to confusion 
 Well, walk away as I don't follow your illusions 
 And see, open your eyes and see, girl.

422,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Evacuation Of The West,"Was on the day the cowboys were band from the range 
 Metal touched the world as a master 
 They rode their ponies down into cities of gold 
 To leave them forever after 
 Now the sun was swollen red and old 
 The earth it was windy, dark and cold 
 Where the highway ends the desert takes it toll 
 So dusty, red and angry 
 It was a time when men died out on the prairie 
 From not having a decent friend 
 At night the ghost to the mode of riders 
 Was a howlin' canyon winds 
 You can hear em' cryin' 
 Good God, I think they're dyin' 
 When them rangers down in Dallas 
 Had all but all given' it up and left 
 And those that hung on hopin' 
 Was trying their best to, to forget 
 The way those outlaws and desperados 
 Right from the cheapest to the best 
 Rode in on ponies made of skin and bones 
 Gave up their rusty guns and went back home 
 And the governor was sent down from population control 
 And Marshall law was passed 
 Riverboat gamblers put their money on faith 
 For the time for hope had passed 
 In the cold blue light of the desert night 
 There was a thousand starry ships 
 And men came down from still I don't know where 
 With death on their fingertips 
 Now there's no more kings in Texas 
 I swear they rounded up each and every one 
 And old Atlanta Canastoga 
 Reached from the Rocky Mountains into the old dead sun 
 Now Anna Maria walks the plains alone 
 The last of a struggling people 
 She thinks of all those outlaws who wanted to reach for the skies 
 And got stuck up on the steeple 
 Oh, you can hear them cryin' 
 Good god, I think they're dying' 
 In the wind lord, you can hear em' sigh"

424,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Fade To Black,"Sunday matinee 
 In a one dog town 
 You're two seats away 
 I move two seats down 
 Wipe the tears from your eyes 
 The first kiss I stole 
 I walk you home 
 The credits roll 
 Fade to black 
 Fade to black 
 Fade to black 
 Fade to black 
 I hear my voice 
 On the telephone 
 But I'm just running 
 The same old business 
 I feel like I'm off 
 Somewhere so alone 
 Just watching us both 
 Running the distance 
 Watching us both 
 Slowly pull back 
 Fade to black 
 Fade to black 
 Fade to black 
 I come home 
 Clothes all over the place 
 You're crying in the corner 
 Makeup running down your face 
 Your case is packed 
 The fight starts 
 I (?????) cursin' 
 Baby is this the scene 
 Which we been rehearsin' 
 Is this the one 
 Or have I lost track 
 Waitin' for us 
 To fade to black 
 Fade to black 
 Fade to black 
 Fade to black 
 A face wet with shame 
 Eyes filled with hurt 
 I scream out your name 
 You rip my shirt 
 A small bungalow 
 A late afternoon 
 The sunlight falls 
 Like a bright veil 
 A camera pans 
 An empty room 
 The picture dissolves 
 Slowly pulls back 
 Fade to black 
 Fade to black 
 Fade to black"
425,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Follow That Dream,"If your heart is restless from waiting too long 
 When you're tired and weary, and you can't go on 
 Well if a distant dream is a callin' you 
 Then there's just one thing that you can do 
 Yeah, you gotta follow that dream wherever that dream may lead you 
 You gotta follow that dream to find the love you need 
 Now baby, I walk in dreams 
 And I talk in dreams 
 I need someone with a love I can trust 
 And together we'll search for the things that come to us 
 In dreams, baby in dreams 
 And I'm gonna follow that dream wherever that dream may lead me 
 I'm gonna follow that dream to find the love I need 
 Now every man has the right to live 
 The right to a chance to give what he has to give 
 The right to fight for the things he believes 
 For the things that come to him in dreams 
 Baby in dreams, I walk in dreams 
 I talk in dreams 
 I live in dreams"

427,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Gypsy Woman,"From nowhere through the caravan 
 Round the campfire light 
 Lovely woman in motion 
 With hair as dark as night 
 Her eyes were like that of a cat in the dark 
 That hypnotized me with love 
 She was a gypsy woman 
 She was a gypsy woman 
 She was a gypsy woman 
 She was a gypsy woman 
 She was a gypsy woman 
 She danced around and round 
 Guitar's melody 
 From the fire her face was aglow 
 How she enchanted me 
 I'd like to hold her near 
 And kiss her hair and whisper in her ear 
 I love you gypsy woman 
 I love you gypsy woman 
 I love you gypsy woman 
 I love you gypsy woman 
 All through the caravan 
 She was dancing with all the men 
 Waiting for the rising sun 
 Everyone was having fun 
 Hated to see her go 
 Knowing that she'll never know 
 That I love her 
 That I love her 
 I love you gypsy woman 
 I love you gypsy woman 
 I love you gypsy woman 
 I love you gypsy woman 
 Whoever compared it to Part Monkey Part Man hit the nail on the head. It has that same kind of dark, mysterious sound. The vocals are soft and understated, somewhat reminiscent to those on If I should fall behind or Pony Boy. The song is sung with that nasally twang Bruce has grown so fond of lately."
428,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Let's Go Tonight,"Hey little girl with the red dress on 
 There's a party tonight down in ... 
 Yeah and I'm goin' if you need a ride 
 Come on, come on, let's go tonight

 They ride down the streets with death in their eyes 
 And the new world's defeat, baby, it eats your eyes 
 Come on, come on, let's go tonight 
 I said come on, come on, let's go tonight 
 Well a man ... 
 And he lost his wife 
 He walks down the streets babe, with death in his eyes 
 Well everybody wants heaven 
 But nobody wants to die

 I got a date with the preacher's daughter 
 She give me life she bring me water. 
 Every Sunday I watch her work 
 Pretty little (siff?) in a pretty little church 
 Daddy gives her nod she takes collection 
 Daddy gives her nod she kneels by her side. 
 Well I'd sell my soul for just one touch 
 The Lord would too if he loved her half as much. 
 Well I got a date with the preacher's daughter. 
 Her Daddy say that the boy's no good 
 Just want to raise some (coons?) out through the back woods 
 Well baby better believe what your Daddy say 
 Just wanna ramrod baby my life away. 
 It's a long walk to heaven and a road filled with sin 
 And they better open up the freeway to let me in. 
 'Cause I got a date with the preacher's daughter 
 Well now I don't care what the preacher say 
 Hay

 Well now I don't care what the preacher do 
 Hay 
 I don't care what the preacher like

 I don't care what the preacher think 
 Hay 
 Leads me to water but won't let me drink. 
 He leads me to water but won't let me drink.

 (Maracas start, music picks up, Bruce starts yelling) 
 And now it's (whole little world?) on Saturday night 
 Two boys fighting in a halo of light 
 Car door flung open and a radio loud 
 And everybody shouting and running around. 
 Two guys bloody and one I don't know 
 And all little girls shouting ""Go Billy go"" 
 Go Billy go. 
 Well just as I got the preacher's daughter ready for a light 
 And (missed a VH fire?) and something ain't right. 
 And like a she-devil howlin' from the gates of hell 
 Goddam here come the preacher in his Coupe DeVille 
 Burnin' up the backroad kicking in the dirt 
 And oh baby preacher thinks he is church 
 Well now your lips they shine in the willow mist 
 And I swear I'd take you down (young croft?) for just one kiss 
 I got a date with the preacher's daughter

430,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Say Sons,"Well, I got a little girl down by the river 
 Now she keeps ? ? ? tight 
 I got a little girl, she every night 
 She says ""I'm feeling like a wild, hands on ? ? ? 
 Then she keeps me all night. 
 So come on, down by the river 
 Come on, come on now. 
 Just come on, down by the river

 Well baby, let me protect you little darling 
 If you let me ? ? ?

431,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Walking In The Street,"Oh billy stares at cherry in the hall 
 And walks out into the rain so blessed and tall 
 Standin' on the corner with a gun underneath his coat 
 Beneath the stars on the street 
 Oh on lexington avenue they stand 
 Velvet aces they case the promised land 
 Reachin' out across the hoods with both hands 
 Oh, tryin' to catch a ride 
 Tonight we're lovers in the cold 
 Running past the graveyards in the snow 
 Walking in the street with nowhere to go 
 And it's no, no, no 
 Oh and the getaway driver waits outside the store 
 He pulls away just as billy runs out the door 
 Oh and billy won't run anymore, no, no, no 
 Oh baby I can't lay the stars at your feet 
 Oh but I think we could take it all, just you and me 
 Oh come on, you'll see, there's a lot of room 
 For you baby, in this front seat 
 Tonight we're lovers on that road (in the snow) 
 Running past the graveyards in the snow 
 Walking in the street with nowhere to go 
 And it's oh, oh, oh"
432,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Winter Song,"From their northeast source the sour wind roars 
 Bear gifts fresh from the valley waters. 
 Hallow echoes strip Pennsylvania mountain walls 
 With their corsets and their old Betsy ruffles 
 And their slips with pearly white. 
 They stand bulging up against the screen door, 
 And bid you ""Good night."" 
 Summer's sweet and she brings me water, 
 But give me Winter, that old icy whore. 
 While Summer lies meek and follows orders, 
 Winter cries ""Me!"" and pulls you through the door. 
 The limp milk tramp cries metal-flake tears. 
 They drip like honey down the (soot?) of Momma's leg. 
 He lay watchin' a moth eat a hole in his cloth. 
 He'll ask, but he don't beg. 
 Said I'd like to the mademoiselle 
 Who holds the keys to all these doors around her waist 
 And rings the bells. 
 Summer's sweet and she brings me water, 
 But give me Winter, that old icy whore. 
 Summer lies meek and follows orders, 
 Winter cries ""Me!"" and pulls you through the door. 
 With scufflin' sound, the knot-voiced matron makes her rounds, 
 Knockin' on each and every door. 
 With a look like white heat, she sways, salty, sweet 
 And leads me 'cross her Persian floor. 
 She squeezed my hand and before her I stood. 
 I was scared. It was dark, but it was good. 
 Summer's sweet and she brings me water, 
 But give me Winter, that old icy whore. 
 While Summer lies meek and follows orders, 
 Winter cries ""Me!"" and pulls me through her door."
433,Bruce Springsteen,rock,You Gotta Fight,"Little girl in these changing times 
 You got to move on or left behind 
 Every day is a battle again 
 And the state of future looks so damned 
 ... All right 
 And if you get it right 
 ... 
 ... 
 ... 
 Well you just got to fight for what you want 
 You got to fight for what you want 2x 
 For what you want 
 ... 
 Every guide (or better 'guy'?) leaves you so confused 
 ... Which way to turn 
 ... 
 Oh yeah ... 
 All night ... 
 ... With that stone 
 Remember that 
 You got to fight for what you want 3x 
 For what you want

 Got to fight for what you want

434,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Arabian Nights,"Shrieks of Sheiks as they run across the movie screen 
 A thousand sand-dune soldiers led by an Arabian Queen 
 And the harem girls move like fancy (Clancy's) dancers 
 In my dirty dreams 
 And I wake up on the floor clutching the bed-lamp 
 And Mama comes in, she screams 
 ""Hey you been out with that tramp again last night 
 You know that silver-sequined Arab black bitch 
 The one that Mama don't like ?"" 
 But Mama she sings me moontime melodies 
 With this great Top 40 hook 
 She shrugs her shoulders, she don't care 
 Papa just stares and says ""Mary, look the girl's all right 
 The girl's all right"" 
 And there's a tenseness in the air-------He turns and says 
 Don't you know, can't you feel it--------""Tell me son, what's the word ?"" 
 Because there's something hanging there--'Cause you know he can't hear it 
 Pull back the mist and reveal it---------But don't go near it 
 And even if you fear what you near-------It's criticized as too absurd 
 Don't conceal it-------------------------Even the animals fear it 
 'Cause if what Mama feels is too real------Papa says ""Fetch me my flashlight, 
 Son"" 
 She just claims she don't feel it--------And she stumbles out the front door 
 So come out from behind your bunkers 
 'Cause the lift-off's been a bust 
 Oh Papa's Gone and Mama's dead 
 And buried in my rocket dust 
 You're alone now for the first time 
 Don't worry, 'cause that's all right 
 All fear will completely disappear 
 Come the Arabian Night 
 Well the soundman smiles and turns the dials 
 To set the meter readin' rising 
 He pulls the singer's voice from out of his pocket 
 To see if the audience likes it 
 Oh and in the very first row sits sweet Jenny Rue 
 With a bell on her shoe and she wants him to make it 
 He flicks a switch but Jenny moves too fast 
 And the audience sways to the sound of her shotgun blast 
 The manager comes running out from behind stage and says 
 Check the band's arms for bullet holes 
 Make that man roll up his sleeves"" 
 The drummer shoots himself with cyanide 
 And then asks to be relieved 
 And me, I say ""Well, it's too crazy in here 
 Which is the stage door out, I gotta get up tomorrow morning for work"" 
 And the promoter says ""Man, once you're in they all lead out 
 What's the matter man, ain't you heard? 
 There's a war going on on the outside 
 And I'm paying you to sing like a bird 
 So get in and get tough or get up and get out 
 Because things aren't too tight"" 
 I said ""Don't worry, man, everything's gonna loosen up 
 Come the Arabian Night"" 
 Come the Arabian Night 
 So I get back in my bed 
 But outside my window I hear another gang fight 
 It's Duke and the boys against the Devil's best man 
 And both sides have drawn their knives 
 And Duke he's a well-known knife-fighter 
 And with one quick jab he brings the Devil down 
 He smiles 'cause he knows there's a high bounty on Devils 
 In any God-fearin' town 
 Well they say Duke sold the Devil to some priest in Pennsylvania 
 To exhibit on his altar Christmas Night 
 But the Devil's eyes they still burn red with fire 
 As long as Duke walks upright 
 And he swears there's a going to be a showdown 
 Come sundown on the Arabian night"

 But I knew they were wrong 
 You're just a silent one 
 Oh Baby Doll 
 They tried to tell me you could not feel 
 But I found out they tried to conceal 
 From you, that you were a woman 
 Well they brought you into their laboratory 
 And tried to get you to show and tell 
 They wanted to hear you say that you were sorry 
 And then they told you that you were conceived in hell 
 But Baby Doll, you knew 
 You knew that wasn't true 
 You knew that it was them 
 It wasn't you 
 Oh baby doll 
 It was so hard to know you 
 I could not tell, I couldn't show you 
 But I didn't have to, 'cause you already knew 
 Oh baby doll 
 They had to see by touching hands 
 We had to dance to a silent band 
 And you surprised me, being so graceful 
 I know you can't hear these songs I sing 
 But then they're more for me than they are for you 
 Because you don't need these songs, babe, like I do 
 Yeah, you knew the first time that I held you babe 
 You didn't have to hear how I love 
 Oh baby doll 
 They tried to tell me you were deaf and dumb 
 But I knew that they were wrong

436,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Ballad Of The Self-Loading Pistol,"Father, I have come. 
 To tell you about somethin' I done. 
 Well as the night reared it's light head 
 Into a baby's sun, 
 We rolled down into the town 
 From where the black throats come. 
 And you know there was a robb'ry. 
 There was a holdup. 
 Ooh, there was a shootout. 
 And there was a killin'. 
 And there's blood on my hands. 
 Today I killed a man. 
 Well now, sister, you know me well. 
 And you ask me well, how it was I felt. 
 Well, she had an appetite for lovin' 
 Only a fadin' beauty could posses. 
 She knew just what she wanted 
 And she wouldn't take less. 
 I figured it was a small town. 
 It was at sundown. 
 It was just a small crowd of people around. 
 Oh! but he wouldn't put his guns down. 
 No, he wouldn't put his guns down. 
 Oh, he wouldn't put his guns down. 
 Now his blood's on my hands. 
 Today I killed a man. 
 And, papa, you showed me the beauty of buckshot. 
 Well, that song a bullet sings as she whistles. 
 And showed me the story of the self-loading pistol. 
 Well now, father. I have come. 
 To tell you about somethin' I done. 
 He had a widow, runnin' through town screamin'. 
 He had a brother, and his tears were streamin'. 
 Now I'm movin' on the border 
 With a rifle on my shoulder. 
 'Cause, daddy, you showed me the beauty of buckshot. 
 The love song a bullet sings as she whistles. 
 And showed me the glory of the self-loading pistol. 
 And I just come to tell ya, 
 That it don't hurt no more. 
 No, it don't hurt no more, 
 'Cause your son, he's an outlaw. 
 Oh, your son, he's an outlaw. 
 Yes, your son, he's an outlaw. 
 Oh, your son, he's an outlaw. 
 Now, your son, he's an outlaw. 
 Oh, your son, he's an outlaw.

 Today I killed a man."
437,Bruce Springsteen,rock,California,"Well ya know when you're young, 
 There's such a distance between you and your family. 
 Just can't see things from the same point of view. 
 Papa wants a lawyer and mama she wants an author, 
 And all you want is for them to want you. 
 Well, I saw lot of bad signs and we had some real bad timesback on the east coast. 
 And I guess you could say it took California to bring us close. 
 There was a lot of hard livin' and some stone cold women on the east coast. 
 And I saw my papa turn away when I need him the most. 
 And California, she's an angel. 
 Lo, so heavenly dressed 
 And the pacific she's a woman 
 The lord must have loved her best. 
 I got a California rainbow to come give them thunder clouds a rest 
 And the mountain is my friend now, she put me to her test 
 Well you know every father has dreams and schemes fo his own kid. 
 And dreaming it ain't been declaired no capital crime 
 But I just hope when I grow up to have my own kids 
 I'll love them all I can and let 'em make their own minds 
 Now you know how a mother can hold the son through understanding. 
 And my father he once held me close by crying. 
 Whoa, and my mama's love it don't ever leave me standing. 
 And papa's love it just leaves me smiling. 
 Whoa, and my mama she's a rainbow, 
 Gotta see hen on Sunday when she's dressed 
 Whoa, and my papa he's a good man, he gives me and mama his best. 
 Whoa, my mama she's a rainbow, come to give them thunder clouds a rest. 
 And my family is my friend now California put us through her test."

 She Came From Germany to the U.S.A. 
 And was acclaimed as the next Garbo. 
 They came to her on their knees, to bless them, caress them and 
 Tell them what they need. 
 But oh, oh, she did not know. 
 And so she took her place at the bar. 
 Just another fallen star."

 At the bottom of the sea 
 In the dead of night, alive in sleep 
 I hear them calling me 
 Them deep sea desperadoes 
 Them midnight maelstrom freaks 
 The cowboy of the sea 
 So on wings of sleep I pierce the deep 
 And ride like a hurricane 
 At midnight still I paid my bill 
 And turned my back on the land 
 With the help of Old Paint, that seaweed nag 
 It's just Jesse James and me 
 We ride the depths and rob the banks 
 At the bottom of the sea 
 With a seaman's grip on navigation 
 And some fired, hired hands 
 We set forth to confront the nation 
 And lend a cowboy's hand 
 We do the Dolphins' Dance duet 
 My mermaid babe and me 
 Then I ride of into the blue sunset 
 At the bottom of the sea 
 And with the seaman's grip on submarining 
 And some aqualung outlaws 
 Our guns are made of solid dreamin' 
 And bullets from a broken cause 
 And with hand held high to touch the sky 
 A good Texas Ranger I'll beBut sometimes I feel like a lone stranger 
 'Midst the cowboys of the sea 
 Oh and men above he cannot make love 
 He's got to rape his mother the sea 
 And because of his greed 
 We're a vanishing breed 
 We cowboys of the sea"
440,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Elouise,"Well, what power of God does a nun use to hold up parish priests 
 And what makes a good cop let go a beautiful thief 
 Oh, and how does the queen know she got hold that manna honey 
 Oh and what makes an old woman give a young man all her money 
 Well late in the night 'neath that pale moonlight the power comes over me 
 And it's all elouise yeah 
 I'm turning into elvis (and there's nothing I can do) 
 ...Kissed the babysitter. she screamed and I told her it was just the beast in me. 
 And on my way out of the house I shot out my TV 
 I went down to the corner luncheonette and said sally ""fried peanut butter and banana will do (?)"" 
 I'm turning into elvis and there's nothing I can do 
 I threw out my wife and family I took off my wedding ring 
 I told my friends and neighbors to refer to me now as ""king"" 
 I put a chainlink fence around my ranch house and on the gate a sign that reads ""graceland ii"" 
 I'm turning into elvis and there's nothing I can do 
 I visited my mama's grave and I headed out to Hollywood and I signed a picture with mgm 
 I play a rebellious beachboy racecar driver who fucks a nun in the end 
 In the last scene I whip out my big guitar and show her a little memphis-style kung-fu 
 I'm turning into elvis and there's nothing I can do 
 But I drove on straight to vegas and I stopped in the first old stripper bar. 
 Found me a little hooker that looked just like ann-margaret and we rumba'd in my sports car. 
 Well me and my drinking buddies turned my lovin' home into a frikkin' zoo. 
 I'm turning into elvis and there's nothing I can do 
 Well he came to me last night in a dream looking just like he did in '57. 
 He said ""son that guitar is a wonderful thing but it can be the living devils' friend. 
 On the other hand there's sex-starved women, millions of dollars, and anything you want to do."" 
 I'm turning into elvis and there's nothing I can do"
441,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Hollywood Kids,"They're the Hollywood kids each and every one 
 With a high class smile and a little baby's tongue 
 Lonely hard head losers dressed in the tinsel of the times 
 And learn all the latest lines and the order in which they come 
 So perfumed sweet and so obscene 
 Like the fancy dancers of our dirty green 
 Oh they knew hello and good bye but not what goes in between 
 Yeah and its such a scene on Saturday night 
 Fifth avenue freaks strait off the racks 
 They swear you can buy and sell your soul on a good dat outside 
 They're the Hollywood kids each and everyone 
 And on Sunday back into their holes they run 
 And on Monday here I stand alone on this littered stage like an animal who 
 Forgot he was in a cage 
 Just a restless soul 
 Just waiting for 'em to come 
 They're Hollywood kids each and everyone"
442,Bruce Springsteen,rock,If I Were The Priest,"Part of the Hammond demos. 
 (Recorded by Allan Clarke on solo album in 1975) written by Bruce 
 Well there's a light on yonder mountain 
 And it's calling me to shine 
 There's a girl over by the water fountain 
 And she's asking to be mine 
 And ain't that Jesus, he's standing in the doorway 
 With a buckskin jacket, boots and spurs, so really fine 
 He says ""We need you up in Dodge City, son 
 'Cause there's oh so many bad boys (just too many outlaw) 
 Tryin' to work the same line"" 
 Well now if Jesus was the sheriff and I were the priest 
 If my lady was an heiress and my mama was a thief 
 Oh and Papa rode shotgun for the Fargo line 
 There's still too many outlaws 
 Tryin' to work the same line 
 Now old sweet Virgin Mary 
 She runs the Holy Grail saloon 
 Where for a nickel they'll give you whisky 
 And the personally blessed balloon 
 And the Holy Ghost, he's the host with the most 
 He runs the burlesque show 
 Where they let you in for free 
 But oh hit you for your soul when you go 
 And Mary serves Mass on Sunday 
 And then she sells her body on Monday 
 To the bootlegger who will pay the highest price 
 But he don't know he got stuck with a loser 
 Mary's a stone junkie, what's more she's a boozer 
 And she's only been made once or twice 
 By some kind of magic 
 Well things ain't been the same in Heaven 
 Ever since big bad Bobby came to town 
 He's been known to down eleven 
 And then ask for another round 
 And me I got scabs on my knees 
 From kneeling way too long 
 I gotta take a stand, be the man, up where you belong 
 And forget about the old friends and the old times 
 Because there's just too many new boys 
 Tryin' to work the same line 
 Well now if Jesus was the sheriff and I were the priest 
 If my lady was an heiress and my mama was a thief 
 Oh and Papa rode shotgun for the Fargo line 
 There's still too many bad boys 
 Tryin' to work the same line 
 Now there's a light on yonder mountain 
 And it's calling me to shine 
 There's a girl by the water fountain 
 And she's asking to be mine 
 And Jesus, he's standing in the doorway 
 With his six-guns drawn, and ready to fan 
 He says ""We need you son, up in Dodge City"" 
 But I'm already overdue in Cheyenne"
443,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Janey Needs A Shooter,"Well janey's got a doctor who tears apart her insides. 
 He investigates her and he silently bates her sighs 
 He probes with his fingers but he knows her heart only through his stethoscope. 
 Hands are cold and his body's so old 
 Janey turns him down like dope. 
 Janey needs a shooter jack 
 A shooter like me on her side 
 Janey needs a shooter jack 
 A shooter man who knows her style 
 The way that I know her style 
 Well janey's got a priest from his marble pulpit he smiles 
 He provides concilation and confessions at anytime 
 Through the pages of his Bible he holds from what janey hides 
 With her doors open wide she begs come inside 
 But he's frozen in the clear on the outside 
 Janey needs a shooter jack 
 A shooter like me on her side 
 Janey needs a shooter jack 
 A shooter man who knows her style, 
 The way that I know her style 
 Well janey's got a cop who lives round the block and checks on her everynight 
 From at through the jail outside her house his siren roars when he knows that I'm inside 
 Well janey's small and sometimes he scares her 
 So I held her real close she flowed like a ghost 
 And I told her bye, so long, I can't play that dope. 
 Well janey needs a shooter jack 
 A shooter like me on her side 
 Janey needs a shooter jack 
 A shooter man who knows her style, 
 Janey needs a shooter jack 
 A shooter man on her side 
 Janey needs a shooter man 
 A shooter man who knows her style

444,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Jazz Musician,"Well it's Saturday night in New Jersey 
 And you're feeling kinda wet 
 Now the summer heat is getting you worried 
 So you try to look as innocent as you can as you sweat 
 And you've got a woman on the other side of the law 
 But it ain't cool to go see her yet 
 Because her ex-old man's a city cop 
 Who thinks he's auditioning for Dragnet 
 So you stand on the corner looking kinda torn 
 And in the Blue Light Lounge 
 Where death was born 
 The jazz musician blows his horn 
 You pop a letter to your baby in Richmond 
 'Cause you're feeling pretty down 
 She's kinda small but at least she's a rich one 
 Oh, and she needs you real bad 
 And sometimes that's all that counts 
 You had a teenage band and flying hands 
 And oh, you was pretty big, you were pretty big in the 
 South 
 But you passed out on stage and flew into a rage 
 And someone tried to revive you 
 Mouth to mouth 
 You felt a pain in your chest 
 As you passed the crown 
 And in the Blue Light Lounge 
 The lights went down 
 And the audience slipped silently out of town 
 Well now the atheist he burns you for laughing out loud 
 Because he can't understand what you're saying 
 And the word's out when they pushed him in the hole 
 Everybody knows that he went out praying 
 Oh, now the park is dark but the sidewalk's bright 
 And alive with the light of the living 
 Oh and mama can I walk you home tonight 
 'Cause it's a big bad city 
 And this boy's got a lot for the givingI'm stranded in the jungle 
 First stage witness at a company killing 
 I'm clutching my high school diploma, shuffling my feet 
 Promised sixty bucks a week 
 And guaranteed top billing 
 Well you can live a life of love in New York 
 Only if you don't, if you don't love living 
 And I met this taxi driver who drives me around town 
 Telling tales of his back seat women 
 And out on the corner there's no room to move 
 'Cause everybody's trying so hard to groove 
 And in the Blue Light Lounge 
 The jazz musician plays his blues"
445,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Jesse,"Oh Jesse, you better start thinkin' about saving your neck 
 Oh Jesse, you put on that leather jacket like you put on respect 
 You got cleats on your boots and a woman who shoots every time you shuffle out the stage door 
 And darling Jesse, do you know what it's all for? 
 Ah Jesse, your manager brought by them eight by ten glossies of your band 
 Oh Jesse, he says you wear cross around your neck and come on with nails in your hands 
 With your insides showing and your New York band blowin' them old Chicago blues 
 Ah Jesse, can't you see you're the one Jesse 
 Ah Sonny, this time it's you 
 Well Jesse, your child is slobbering all over your pants 
 And Jesse, your wife has fallen into a trance 
 She's got eyes that tell no lies 
 She's seen so many wars 
 Ah be a good boy Jesse, tell her she don't have to look no more. 
 Well Jesse, he knows all the tricks to get the crowd reeling 
 Oh and Jesse, ya he rocks 'em with that old soul feeling 
 And he walks off the stage in a self-adoring haze 
 And gets shoved right out the door 
 Whoa Jesse, can't you see now boy that that's what it's all about Jesse 
 Not even time to do that old played out encore 
 Whoa Jesse"
446,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Lady And The Doctor,"The lady keeps the doctor in a place inside her pocket 
 The circle made her circle like a wheel 
 The doctor gives a strange love, but the lady she don't knock it 
 She's glad to get a piece of anything 
 Because the lady needs the medicine ???????????? 
 Doctor needs the lady to see 
 The doctor keeps the lady in a page in a book 
 On the history of communicable diseases 
 The lady's been to school, she lets the doctor play it cool. 
 He writes the script, she follows his lead. 
 'Cause the doctor writes love story so fine 
 The lady's learned to read between the lines 
 Sometime 
 The doctor, he takes housecalls where he visits the animals 
 In their stalls, shoots them full of juice and then goes home. 
 The lady hits the supermarket where she rides the aisles in a shopping cart 
 Till she feels she's played enough of the part to set by ooh, 
 The lady feels its enough to just be good. 
 But the doctor has his need to be understood. 
 The doctor feels he's so abused and the lady feels she's so unused 
 And demands the doctor tends her daily parts. 
 Ooh, but the doctor just can't do it because so long ago the lady 
 Blew it, they're too old now to make another start. 
 The lady feels the doctor's made of stone. 
 The doctor' heart, it just ain't fond of ?home?"
447,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Marie,"Marie, she comes to me in the twilight 
 When the wind blows down across the river 
 So cold, the fishermen cry 
 She rapes me in a rage of rainbow violence 
 Till my bare nerves, they sing 
 Like the strings of a violin 
 And the room seeps into a savage silence 
 Soaked in colours, red as blood, blue as night 
 And Marie she skins me alive 
 Carves her initials in my side 
 Lures me with her purrs and cuts me with her knife 
 And the horses pound like thunder 
 They bolt like lightning on her range 
 She feels she's going under and she zeros in the rein 
 She's so strange 
 Well, Marie, you know, she's the queen of all the stallions 
 And I'm her prince of mules 
 And one of her principal fools 
 Marie, she's got the claws of a falcon 
 And she's perched on my shoulder, and slowly digging in 
 But she, oh she can be so strange sometimes 
 Like at night ... 
 Or when the neighbors come to dine 
 Marie, she skins me alive 
 Burns her initials in my hide and then leaves me all alone 
 Branded to the bone 
 And my heart pounds like her horses 
 Oh, stampeding on the range 
 Marie knows all the sources 
 And she shoots me with her pain 
 And for her, I take it, Lord, down in my veins 
 And I watch her dance like some berserk fairy 
 All across the concrete prairies of Bleecker Street 
 Marie, she can be so strangeBut she's the only lonely cowgirl on my range"
448,Bruce Springsteen,rock,No Need,"She's a broken winged angel 
 Refugee from things her mama knew 
 And she's done everything the Bible say not to do 
 Well I don't know if she believes in Jesus 
 The good book, or even Satan you see 
 I'm just trying to get her to believe in me 
 Oh, 'cause when I see her face 
 No matter where I am I'm in the right place 
 And the girls I left behind 
 Oh, they never satisfied me, it's so true 
 But baby, baby, you do 
 She's the belle of eighth street 
 High society's midnight vamp 
 Oh, she's my queen and I'm her tramp 
 Yes she's a free falling flyer 
 And she flows whichever way that the wind blows 
 And she's the only woman I never knew 
 Who could teach me more about me, bind me in chains 
 And still let me be free 
 My heart swells up inside 
 Starts beating like I'm gonna die 
 And my body breaks in pain 
 As she falls down on me like the rain 
 It's only her and my songs that keep me from going insane 
 And I guess I'm one of those people 
 Who measures love in pain 
 You see, I never had too much personal success 
 And to me there's nothing sweeter 
 Than a teardrop of rain 
 I just love that feeling of sadness 
 Oh and it worries me so ... 
 She's my west side angel 
 She looks so funky in her Hollywood wing 
 And she knows how I stumble when I talk 
 So she says: ""don't talk, babe, just sing"" 
 And I have seen her body in candle glow 
 In the deep heart of the night 
 When you finally let loose of everything 
 Oh, and she loves me like such a good woman 
 And still, oh, she's just a sweet young thing 
 And I know this might sound crazy 
 Or just the words of a young fool 
 But I swear I'd be on the floor 
 And she ever walked out the door 
 I swear I'd wish that she would shoot me first 
 And I know that sounds insane but sometimes I believe it's true 
 And that's what scares me worst 
 'Cause I dance for her 
 Take any chance for her 
 And I play for her 
 Lord God knows I play for her 
 And I need for her 
 And I bleed for her"
449,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Prodigal Son,"In a place where outlaws abound from the range 
 ???On a day mountains has fallen to falls??? 
 In a land where boys are forbidden to grow 
 And Mell is the only master 
 Were the highway ends and the desert breakes 
 And buildings are bendt from great earthquackes 
 And statesmen crawl on their bellys like snakes 
 And feed of the public hunger 
 In a land were sky-scrapers scratch the sky 
 And delinquent daughters to their mothers still lie 
 Papa stands on the corner he ???waitin' to beat the drum??? 
 Welcome Home My Prodigal Son 
 When Rivers run raging through city streets 
 And great eagels have fallen from their loofty peaks 
 And policemen moonlight the sideshow freeks 
 For the final crime is committed 
 When Presidents ride in Ford Mustangs 
 And the Black man releases his Caddilac ???fangs??? 
 And your chech died in bed as the landlord thanks the young girl next door 
 For the rent 
 Where telegraph wires are atached to your mind 
 Delinquent daughters to their mothers still lie 
 Papa stands on the corner ???waitin to beat the drum??? 
 Welcome Home My Prodigal Son 
 When the telephone rings and falls of the hook 
 And your legs have been stolen by some defense department crook 
 And you startin' to think about writing a book 
 But now you won't pledge allingence to anything 
 And the maid comes in with coffee and cake 
 In a low-cut dress she wore just for your sake 
 You explain your not dead and she takes it as a compliment 
 And sticks out her tongue and asks for requests 
 In a land were skyscrapers scrapes the sky 
 And delinquent daughters to their mothers still lie 
 Papa stands on the corner ???waitin' to beat the drum??? 
 Welcome Home My Prodigal Son"
450,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Randolph Street,"I remember yesterday and I'd sit and watch the hound dogs play 
 Howlin' at the china moon 
 ? ? Now yesterday is the busted blues 
 Life was young, things were easy, 
 Days were short, nights were warm 
 Time were good. hate was shallow 
 ? ? The horse crazy behind the ? ? ? ? 
 I swear that I've seen your face somewhere back in that time 
 And I'm in theat place. do you remember? 
 The old house stood like world war two with just rooms 
 And a hall to be used. 
 The lady was mean. 
 Just slightly unclean with a heart of cold silver and gold. 
 Kitchen smelled of kerosene. 
 Celing hung down on ? veil? and rotted beams 
 And the man, they said, his work could of hung in the room 
 Now he sits around all day because his left arm won't move 
 He was a master of the art of electricity 
 He lectured on tours and circuitry. 
 He was self-employed, but he could never see his way into the light 
 He had a room full of switches and dials and lights and 
 A head full of clouds and eyes full of sight. 
 And when it got dark, 
 I could hear his heartbeat like a mother in the night. 
 She stood like a guardian ready to give everything up. 
 If I had asked for a sword and her blood in a cup. 
 But there was just time when I asked for too much. 
 She sighed because she could not give it. 
 We used to sit beneath the tree just the lady, the radio man and me. 
 And I think it was the winter of '63 the man went away and let us be 
 It was early on an august day that the lady decided she must go away. 
 Her heart it seems could not pay the price for what her body was buying 
 I came home from school and I found the note went into the kitcken 
 And lit the old stone with songs set on overload. 
 I turned on the TV, spent the rest of the sfternoon watching 
 All my cartoons through the hall 
 And across the porch was the sun surrendered like a crying torch."
451,Bruce Springsteen,rock,She's Leaving,"She's leaving, she's leaving 
 Everybody knows 
 She's leaving, she's leaving 
 And I feel like such a fool 
 She left me standing here just two feet tall 
 I just don't know how she could do it 
 In front of our friends and all 
 She had better things to do and bigger plans 
 I thought we could make it with just us two 
 But I guess we can't 
 'Cause she can't 
 And I'm only one man 
 But I love her 
 It's winter 
 Suddenly it's winter 
 And I feel so cold inside 
 It's different 
 It could've been so different 
 If only she didn't feel that need to lie 
 What's the matter girl 
 Didn't you think I was that strong 
 That you couldn't tell me 
 What was going on"
452,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Song To The Orphans,"The moltitude assembled and tried to make the noise 
 The black blind poet generals 
 And restless loud white boys 
 But time grew thin and the axis 
 Was left somehow incomplete 
 Where instead of child lions 
 We found aging junkie sheep 
 How many wasted have I seen signed ""Hollywood or bust"" 
 Left to ride them ever ghostly arizona gusts 
 Oh, cheerleader tramps and kids with big amps 
 Sounding in the void 
 High society vamps and ex-heavyweight champs 
 Mistaking soot for soil 
 So break me now big mama 
 As old faithful breaks the day 
 Believe me, my good linda, 
 The aurora will shine your way 
 The confederacy, she's in my name now 
 And the hounds are held at bay 
 The axis needs a stronger arm 
 Do you feel your muscles play? 
 The doorstep blanket weaver 
 Madonna she's pushing bells 
 From house to house to house to house 
 Giving last kisses and wishing well 
 To every gypsy, mystic and all star hero 
 That the kids might find the place 
 Who've been lost forever to papa and mama 
 On their weekends out in space 
 Now the sons they search for fathers 
 But their fathers have all gone 
 The lost souls search for saviors 
 But saviours don't last long 
 Those aimless, questionless renegade brats 
 Who live their lives in songs 
 They run the length of a candle 
 In a goodnight whisper and a puff they're gone 
 So break me now big mama 
 As old faithful breaks the day 
 Believe me, my good linda, 
 The aurora will shine your way 
 The confederacy, she's in my name now 
 And the hounds are held at bay 
 The axis needs a stronger arm 
 Do you feel your muscles play? 
 The missions are filled with hermits looking for a friend 
 The terraces are filled with cat-men looking for a way in 
 There are orphans junked on silver mountains 
 Lost in celestial alleyways 
 They wait for that old tramp dog man moses 
 He takes in all the strays 
 ""Now, don't grow on empty legends 
 Or lonely cradle songs 
 'Cause billy the kid was just a bowery boy 
 Who made his living twirling his guns"" 
 The night she's long, she's lanky 
 She speaks in her mother tongue 
 And lullabies the refugees 
 With an amplifier's hum 
 So break us now big mama 
 As old faithful breaks the day 
 Believe me, my sweet linda, 
 Oh, help is sure on the way 
 The confederacy, she's in my name now 
 And the hounds are held at bay 
 The axis needs a stronger arm 
 Do you feel your muscles play? 
 The confederacy, she's in my name now 
 And the hounds are held at bay 
 The axis needs a stronger arm 
 Do you feel your muscles play?"
453,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Southern Son,"Born on the Hudson, twenty-two years gone 
 Bred and raised in the City 
 From my daddy's knee I learned the Union songs 
 But Grandma sang lullabies of Dixie 
 And though the Northern winter fills my heart with joy 
 Oh it's a Southern sun that shines down 
 On this Yankee boy 
 Mama dreamed of Paris nights 
 And boatin' on the Seine 
 She said, we're gonna make it there too 
 Soon as Papa comes home again 
 And she'd speak to me in broken French 
 Dressed like a painting of Lautrec's 
 In the night she'd clutch me to her breast 
 And say, we'll make it outta here yet 
 And though Parisian women 
 Strut so fine down the Eiffel mall 
 It's a Southern one I sing my songs for 
 Well with the local bunch of do-good boys 
 And an old man from the West 
 We crossed the land in the caravan 
 Yes we traveled with the best 
 With circus acts and vaudeville hacks 
 And the Mississippi Delta Queen 
 She told me the news and sold me her blues 
 In an alley in New Orleans 
 And though the Western plains are still stained 
 With the blood of great cowboys 
 It's a Southern sun 
 That shine down on this Yankee boy"
454,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Street Queen,"She got high class, 
 She rides around in a cut down Chevy machine. 
 Her eyes are plate glass, 
 Oh and legs like a limousine. 
 She comes stocked with sass, 
 And pride ain't there to be mean. 
 She's the baddest thing this town's ever seen. 
 Oh, Street Queen. 
 Well, she got a turbine engine, mama, 
 With maximum thrust. 
 Cadillac hips, she's got the best on the strip, 
 She knows how to use a clutch. 
 She comes on shiny and black, 
 And, boys, if you hit her you better be tough. 
 Oh she's the slickest thing that I've ever seen. 
 Oh, Street Queen. 
 And you can always tell a moment she's around, 
 You can hear the loud engine roaring. 
 She says, ""Come on, get in. Hey baby, you want to go for a ride?"" 
 I know she sets your mind soaring. 
 Oh and the boys, they jump back, 
 As that engine unwinds. 
 I'm glued to my seat, mama, 
 As I watch that speed-o-meter climb. 
 Oh she moves so fast she's almost obscene. 
 Street Queen. 
 Well, if you're going to come streakin' down my street, baby, 
 Like an angel with them Chevy Wings. 
 If you're going to come streakin' down my street, baby, 
 Like an angel with them Chevy Wings. 
 You better watch out, Street Queen, 
 'Cause you're messing with the king."

 It was for me, for me that she died 
 That's What you get for loving me (repeated 4 times)

 True Love, unhappiness 
 I fall down on my knees and I cry 
 It's my way of saying goodbye 
 That's what you get for loving me (repeated 5 times)

456,Bruce Springsteen,rock,The Word,"Well you flash your tongue like diamonds 
 You tied me to your wildcat schemes 
 And you forced me into a power dive 
 And left your mark on my jeans 
 And I hear the word on your soldiers 
 And I hear the word on Jesus too 
 I heard the word on the country 
 But I never heard the word on you 
 Your love was like a machine gun 
 I wore your bugle in my belt 
 And I was your kid glove lover 
 All the cards were yours 
 You always dealt 
 And I stood before your soapbox 
 Noiseless and shoeless 
 Playing my pantry boy's games 
 You had your hands raised up to the sky 
 Shouting oh Sunday deity 
 Oh big daddy longlegs 
 Come down and bless your sister please 
 You were shoutin' orders about the construction 
 Going on down the highway 
 You were namin' names, blamin' blames 
 And you blamed me 
 You wore your heart like a challenge 
 Far and apart for anyone who came 
 Open and wide like the river 
 With rocks on both sides to keep the water tame 
 But I heard the word on your high tides 
 And I felt the pain when I tried 
 To rip your flood gates wide 
 And pull your body on over to my side 
 Where we both could hide 
 But you heard about the freedom ride 
 And you heard about the highway crew 
 Who could cut the light a little bit faster than you 
 So you left me just your shoes 
 And I hear the word on Jesus 
 And I hear the word on his marching troop 
 And I hear the word on the country 
 But I never heard the word on you"
457,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Two Hearts In True Waltz Time,"Well the first frame finds her running

 She camouflages herself in dayglo paint 
 And she sings her love songs through a funnel 
 And she clings to the walls like a cat who calls 
 The shots for life and for death 
 Wearing nothing but the make-up she uses 
 To try and cover up for herself 
 Well if she can't hide her sword 
 She gives no terms for surrender 
 'Cause she's living the Third World War 
 The Tunnel Police, they steadily increase 
 The search for where she hides her kid 
 She swings on a vine across the State Line 
 They measured the length of her skid 
 She never goes back to do something she didn't 
 Or undo something she did 
 Smoke streams from the street 
 And the night is complete 
 With a long and fiery belch 
 She's just another Orphan Annie cartoon and a Raquel Welch 
 She rides like Caesar, brandishing a whip 
 On the hood of his squad car 
 As the siren wails she silently sails 
 Leaving footprints in the tar 
 Oh she breaks with the dawn 
 And by morning she's gone 
 Leaving nothing but another night 
 She returns to her home 
 Like a dog returns to a bone 
 Another unsatisfied wife 
 And there's little Booth 
 Secure from the truth 
 He wants her more than he's got the guts to say 
 'Cause as she needs to be real 
 He needs to conceal 
 The realness of his place 
 So he sings a little song 
 And in a chiffon sarong 
 She performs a black ballet in space 
 But she's another flop with a fancy name 
 And he's just another cop with a pretty face 
 So together they commit the ultimate crime 
 Two hearts locked in true waltz time"
458,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Vibes Man,"Vibes man in the alley, play me your spitball serenade, 
 And a deeper blue and you'll be playing in your grave. 
 Save your notes, spend them on your blues, boy. 
 Help your darlin' yearlin' blues, boy. 
 Hit the church note, ring it! 
 Vibes man sing the trashcan hear your junkman singing. 
 Fish lady, don't you bait those tenement walls. 
 Don't take corner boys because they're too easy. 
 You were born black and blue, 
 You didn't have to wait for somebody to hit you. 
 Take my arm, I'll move with you down Broadway. 
 Take my arm, oh honey, I'll walk with you down Broadway. 
 I'm the young man and I'll be proud, 
 And I can talk real loud. 
 And I'm from out of town, too. 
 Won't you come home with me. 
 Won't you come home with me. 
 But no, 'cause she won't take a train, 
 Oh, she won't take that train. 
 Oh, she won't take a train. 
 Oh, she won't take that train. 
 She won't take a train. 
 Oh, she won't take that train. 
 Oh, she won't take a train. 
 Oh, she won't take that train. 
 You won't take the train. 
 She won't take the train. 
 'Cause she's afraid those tracks are gonna slow her down. 
 And when she turns around, 
 I'm gonna be gone like the ???????"
459,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Visitation At Fort Horn,"Behind the walls where heat lightning falls 
 On five starred gnat-faced princess 
 The buffalo man shoots at the tin cats 
 Turns and shouts ""children, blow your bridges"" 
 On death row halls where dustmen stall 
 Where time's an enemy and a friend 
 At night jackals crawl from the cracks in the walls 
 And salvation is never spoken 
 Morning sickness breaks the garrison gate 
 The cavalry cries for treason 
 The soldier strokes his pony and goes to shine the captain's sword 
 In this young boy's eyes lie reason 
 And the sergeant bursts in and cries ""i caught a prisoner, captain, 
 A prisoner, what ho!"" 
 The captain looks up and says ""let her go"" 
 ""But captain, she patrols the light ships that patrol the sea around 
 The rainbow tips, whose bagpiper wail unbroken 
 She haunts the night and the dawnin' light 
 On her sounds and words your cavalry chokin' "" 
 The captain says ""have no fear, boys 
 For what you hear 
 Because danger can't be spoken"" 
 The whirlwind crackles and I hear the rustle of shackles 
 From the stockade door bursts merlin 
 His eyes red, and swollen, like they've been pushed into the sun 
 His robes aflame and burnin' 
 He jumps a horse, tries to get away 
 But he gets caught in his eyes, tangled in his eyes 
 He falls to the ground, his neck is broken 
 His spirit rises high in the western sky 
 The magician lies an empty token 
 The sergeant walks over and kicks his body 
 And says ""captain, he's dead - what shall we do with him ? "" 
 The captain says ""hang him 
 For though his live moments on this earth are well spent 
 And I can se his body is sure well bent 
 It's magic that must be broken"" 
 Now night cradles low 
 The penniless weed plays wrath felt in the captain's corner 
 With anvil spread wide, the captain glides 
 Each blow to scare her, not to hurt her 
 She spits ""what truth"" at the captain's boots 
 But he holds his rage suspended 
 The sergeant comes in stinkin' of soldier's gin 
 And cries ""captain, the storm she blows unending"" 
 Oh and the lightning cracked and the sky was hacked 
 By dagger rain it was torn 
 And the yard was charged into a raging sea 
 And the captain ran crazily 
 For the first time in his life, in the captain's heart 
 Fear was born 
 The captain storms out on the stoop, panic strikes 
 He sees merlin's hung body stretched by the neck 
 Silhouetted on his door 
 The sergeant screams ""captain, look high, look to the sky!"" 
 Some whirling, swirling emission ... 
 But the captain falls to his knees crying silent pleas 
 'Cause he knows, he knows, and he thinks to himself 
 ""A magician..."""
460,Bruce Springsteen,rock,War Nurse,"She was just another war nurse 
 She could strike a noble pose 
 Caring for our young boys when a bullet laid them low 
 She would hover over them and cry 
 And pull the cover over them when they'd die 
 She was just another lonesome lady, lover, sister of the gun 
 And though France would call her darling, 
 She was a nurse 'neath the rising sun 
 She knew no hells or heavens, or harbors or havens 
 She was every mother, sister, wife and lover 
 Whose love a soldier boy was savin' 
 She believed in the birth of the broad sword 
 She was not a shielded one 
 Though France would call her darlin' 
 She was nurse 'neath the rising sun 
 She was a soldier's shrapnel sweetheart, direct from the combat zone 
 She was a reincarnation o fthe Virgin MAry 
 She was the hooker down in San Antone 
 And though her heart was somewhere in Iceland 
 Commanding the dawn patrol 
 Blessed in this blood and stitched into these bones 
 The war nurse left her soul 
 Blessed in this blood and stitched into these bones 
 The war nurse left her soul"
461,Bruce Springsteen,rock,After The Thunder,"An echo fades of sounds once heard 
 By thousands brought together for 
 His ringing voice, a soul that stirred 
 The faithful to a mighty roar. 
 For twenty years upon the stage 
 For twenty years upon the stage 
 The passion deep within his soul 
 Brought forth the anger and the rage 
 His vision locked upon one goal. 
 The promises of rock and roll could 
 Break the chains upon his life, 
 Guitar in hand he vowed he would 
 Be free from pain and inner strife. 
 He shook the rafters in the halls 
 And brought the faithful to their feet, 
 His river coursed through mighty walls 
 Across this land, down every street. 
 With flag unfurled he took the word 
 Across the seas to hungry youth 
 Who raised their hands when e'er they heard 
 His cries for faith, and hope, and truth. 
 Today he stands with inner peace 
 A man content with home and health, 
 Upon his brow a jagged crease 
 A symbol of success and wealth. 
 The thunder of his younger days 
 Has passed, and now his words reveal 
 A calmer soul in many ways 
 Fulfilled with satisfactions real. 
 His arms upraised against the light 
 He stands alone, his eyes look toward 
 The ground below, a bird in flight 
 Still searching for his true reward. 
 His mission done, he finds retreat 
 With children and a loving wife, 
 His body tired from the heat 
 The price he pays for touring life. 
 But deep within the longings stir 
 The music runs within him still, 
 His passions for the times that were 
 Are stronger than his iron will. 
 And all of us who know the man 
 Will come together when he cries 
 The message we all understand 
 The thunder in us never dies."
462,Bruce Springsteen,rock,A Night With The Jersey Devil,"Hear me now! 
 I was born 13th child, 'neath the 13th moon 
 Spit out all hungry and born anew 
 Daddy drag me to the river tie me in rocks, throw me in where it's deep and wide 
 I go down, I don't die 
 Hole in the river bottom, I crawl through 
 Come back, kill six brothers and sisters, kill papa too 
 Sway down Mama, sway down low 
 They gonna know me wherever I go 
 Into my bed with her kerosene my mama creep 
 Set my flesh to burning, whilst I sleep 
 I burn, burn, burn, till my soul burn black 
 Black rains fall, I come back, I come back 
 Get down Mama, get down low 
 They gonna know me wherever I go 
 16 witches, cast 16 spells 
 Make me a guitar outta skin and human skull 
 Sing you a song like the wind in the sandy loam 
 Bring you, baby, out your happy home 
 Ram's head, forked tail 
 Clove hoof, love's my trail 
 I sup on your body, sip on your blood like wine 
 Out world theirs, this world mine 
 So kiss me, baby, till it hurts 
 God lost in heaven, we lost on earth 
 Sway down Mama, sway down low 
 They gonna know me wherever I go 
 Wherever I go, wherever I go 
 Well I got a brand new lover, I love her yes I do 
 She's my one and only and her name is Baby Blue 
 Now baby-baby-baby, baby-baby, Baby Blue..."

466,Bruce Springsteen,rock,Out Of Work,"8 a.m. I'm up and my feet beating on the sidewalk 
 Down at the unemployment agency, all I get is talk 
 I check the want ads but there just ain't nobody hiring 
 What's a man supposed to do when he's down and he's 
 Out of work 
 I need a job, I'm out of work 
 I'm unemployed, I'm out of work 
 I need a job, I'm out of work 
 I go to pick my girl up 
 Her name is linda brown 
 Her dad invites me in 
 He tells me to sit down 
 The small talk that we're making 
 Is going pretty smooth 
 But then he drops a bomb 
 ""Son, what d'ya do ? "" 
 I'm out of work 
 I need a job, I'm out of work 
 I'm unemployed, I'm out of work 
 I need a job, I'm out of work 
 Hey mr president I know you got your plans 
 You're doing all you can now to aid the little man 
 We got to do our best to whip that inflation down 
 Maybe you got a job for me just driving you around 
 I'm out of work 
 These hard times, they're enough 
 To make a man lose his mind 
 I'm out of work 
 Up there you got a job but down here below 
 I'm out of work 
 I need a job, I'm out of work 
 I'm unemployed, I'm out of work 
 I need a job, I'm out of work
