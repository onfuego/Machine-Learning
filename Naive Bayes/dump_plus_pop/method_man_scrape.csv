 Rhymes be the proof while I'm drinkin' 90 proof 
 Huh vodka, no OJ, no straw 
 When you give it to me aiy, give it to me raw 
 I've learned when you drink Absolut straight it burns 
 Enough to give my chest hairs a perm 
 I don't need a chemical blow to pull a hoe 
 All I need is Chemical Bank to pay da mo' 
 What, basically that, Meth-Tical, ninety-four style 
 Word up we be hazardous *car crashing* *horn passing me* 
 Northern spicy brown mustard hoes

 *Bell rings* 
 (Method Man, (Raekwon)) 
 Who lit that shit it was I the chinky-eye 
 Cheeba-hawk from New York, Tical Staten Isle 
 Niggaz thought, that they could walk a dog but they caught 
 A bad situation, 'cause I'm a sandwich short 
 Of a picnic, cause you ain't equipped with the sickening 
 Style, blowing up the spot like ballistic 
 Missiles, I be comin' through like the four-nine-three-eleven 
 Tearing up the power-u, Me-Tical 
 A bad motherfucking Buddha Monk, what the fuck 
 Hit your chest, like cardiac arrest, blow the front 
 Out the frame, hit the pussycat for the pain 
 Of the dog shit, nobody move run your garments 
 A rugged vet, terrible like a Champion sweat 
 Wrap a power in a tec, to wet 
 A nigga up, with all the dangerous diseases 
 Sniffling sneezing coughing aching stuffy head fever 
 Fucker, I think it's bout time that you suffer 
 Bobbing on my nob like an all day sucker

 *Bell rings* 
 (Raekwon) 
 I'm going all out kid no turnbacks 
 You could try to front, get smoked and that's that 
 Lyric assassin, dressed in black bugging 
 Sixteen shots to your mug, from a slug then 
 I go to war in a concrete jungle, make the punt 
 Cause niggaz act funny, and fumble 
 But I relax, count my shells, a lot of heads gotta fly 
 Niggaz stay strapped, armed to die 
 Time for jet-black Tim boot, flowing 
 Wha-Su God get him, hit 'em with the nine troop 
 No question, cha-cha-BLOW in the session 
 Bloodshot in that direction, cypher 
 *Bell rings* 
 Attack you like chess moves best move 
 Yo, yeah, yo 
 The boards, your ass 
 'Tack, 'tack, 'tack, uH! *bell rings* 
 'Tack the boards like chess moves best move 
 At Rae through, comin' at your motherfuckin crew 
 Live direct, yeah you better step 
 Gunshots ring on the set, let's jet 
 Motivate, to the gate 
 With some quick high Rae stay fly, and rob your Isle 
 Airwaves, yo behave

 *Bell rings three times* 
 Ah shit! 
 Chef Vs. Meth Vs. Meth"
6,Method Man,hiphop,Sub Crazy,"Intro/Chorus: 
 We can all get by if we want now 
 Get a phat piece of the pie if we want 
 Motherfuckers getting mad high when they want now 
 I will survive, recognize it be Tical 
 Verse One: 
 Word up, our niggas is strapped, ready for war on the ill block 
 Things just ain't peace no more, fuck it 
 If you ain't with me then forget me 
 Niggas try to stick me, retaliation, no hesitation, shifty 
 Creeping niggas in the dark, triggers with no heart 
 Ripping ass apart, I'll be swimming with the sharks now 
 Stay out my water or it's manslaughter 
 Kid, you oughta start reaching for that nickel-plated auto- 
 Matic, my thoughts get sporadic, loaded raps 
 Busting mad shots to ya attic 
 They say this hazard, this flows a hazard 
 Straight from Hazard County with a bounty on his head, and it said 
 ""Wanted Dead or Alive,"" I swear by the whites of they eyes 
 To never take a dive I will survive 
 Verse Two: 
 Shit's gonna happen if niggas start acting 
 Like they want problems, you want em, you got em 
 Rap contact, is writing this exactly, 
 The way it should be, attacked 
 Killer Beeeees on a swarm 
 Shit like Martial Law drops bombs like Qur'an 
 The ism helps to stimulate my pugilism 
 I bust rhymes like jizm, impregnate the rhythm with the wisdom 
 Decipher the stee, I be hyper, I bring all the styles 
 That rekindle like old flames 
 Saliva, check the wicked flows I deliver 
 Oops, I mean deliver like the Hudson River 
 Styles be tight, trite like a thief in the night 
 I be the sneaky-ass nigga busting nuts in yo wife 
 Blasted, bugging off Bacardi and acid 
 Flipping on the mic, it's a classic"
7,Method Man,hiphop,Release Yo' Delf,"Blue Raspberry:

 Blazing, the stuff that ignites stimulation 
 Inside ya, 'cause I be that house over water 
 Forgot in the realm that be deep as the Poseidon 
 Adventure, niggaz need to touch they freaking picture 
 For the sickness, that be spreading with the quickness 
 Remedies, cousin I be doing on my enemies 
 Penalty, then I drink forties to they memories 
 Emotion, rushing through your down street vicinity 
 Blunt smoke, in the air reveals my identity

 To blow a nigga up, with my Five Fingers of Death 
 I bring it to his whole damn fam, understand 
 If he fronting, on any man down with the Clan

 Serial, killer, style from Big Isle No Stat, 
 My peoples are you with me where you at? 
 Shit's getting deep in here, I mean like thick 
 Niggaz looking all in my face like they want dick 
 It's about to hit the fan, hit the flo' 
 That's all I can stands and I can't stands no mo' 
 What is it? Niggaz think they bigger 
 Because they got the finger on the trigger of a pistol 
 They don't know I'm wicked, when I start to kick it 
 With the raw sound, wash it down with a Mystic 
 Then I add a snapple, nigga want the juice but he don't want the hassle 
 Then we try to overthrow the castle 
 Better yet the tent when I'm coming to your town 
 Black man, the rental, God, the pistol 
 YAH! If you don't want a burn from GLOCK then beware, 
 I buck shots, we move up, the buck stops here 
 No more dough will be made 
 Unless it's being made by hoes 
 What's that rhythm what's that sound 
 Party people getting down 
 When it hit the baddest man 
 Just breathe in, till then 
 And keep it moving, baby keep it moving 
 I plan to keep it moving, you know we keep it movin uh

 Here comes the ruckus, the motherfucking ruckus 
 Thousands of cut-throats and crumb-snatching fuckers 
 Straight from the brain, I'll be givin' you the pain, anger 
 Coming from the 36th Chamber, Bang! 
 Tical, hitting with the Buddha-Fist style 
 Shotgun slamming in your chest piece, plow! 
 Brain, is blown all over the terrain

 When first we practice to deceive 
 Guns be clicking, running with my clan we be sticking 
 Whatever, my street family stays together 
 Represent what I invent, Killah Hill 
 Resident, rest in peace to my nigga Two Cent 
 The street life is the only life I know 
 I live by the code style it's mad P.L.O... 
 Iranian thoughts are covered like an Arabian 
 Grab the nigga who on the spot and put a nine to his cranium 
 I... can't... get no satisfaction, niggas won't be lasting 
 Long, unless they get protection, for real 
 Strong, coming with my clan so what's happening 
 Commercial rap, hate it with a passion 
 The M-E-T-H-O-D got me drinking O.E. all night in a M.P.V. 
 Just maxing, looking for hoes, you know relaxing 
 Bitches know the hour it be time for some action

 A little buckwylin, island called Stat 
 Where niggaz carry gats in there black wolly hats 
 Now I'm mad known for the bones and the rap 
 And youse an unknown with a faulty contract 
 Wake up and smell the Met-chod motherfukker, contact

 Spot ya twenty points and you still can't score, nuttin'

 Rain coming down, so weatherproof your leather 
 Jacket, a nigga with an axe couldn't hack it 
 I spark 'em like a match 
 Coming back, it's the Met-chod, say it loud

 Nigga get back, ya pussy cat, I'm fearsome 
 Basically that, I'm all of that, and then some 
 While I... was out on tour, going beserk 
 I heard you were at the sand-box and kicking dirt 
 All on my name but you can't pull my file 
 You don't know me and you don't know my style 
 Coming out there like that there, Yeah 
 Even Grizzly Adams couldn't bear 
 Ahhheheheh, I taught the boy everything he know 
 Go on you bad motherfuckaz 
 See I told you that kid go back to that Dolemite 
 Everybody needs to love Dolemite 
 I love Dolomite, you love Dolemite 
 Hey, how you doing nigga, I know you 
 Knowing I didn't when I did 
 Meth-Tical 
 Shit, I told the boy 
 If ya can't get yourself a ten 
 The least you can do is spark five two's 
 And we out, Method"
10,Method Man,hiphop,Mr. Sandman,"Intro: RZA (singing by Blue Raspberry) 
 *Bees buzzing* 
 *Man screaming in torture* 
 This is... (Mr. Sandman bring me a good dream) 
 Serious, the craziest 
 ... D-da, (Mr. Sandman bring me a good dream) day-da 
 Danger, dangerous... style 
 Verse One: RZA 
 Lyrical shots from the glock 
 Bust bullet holes on the chops, I want the number one spot 
 With the science, of a giant 
 New York defiant, brutal like domestic violence 
 Silence of the Lambs, o-ccured when I slammed in 
 Foes grab their chairs, to be mad as Ralph Cramden 
 Others come with shit, as silly as Art Carney 
 But my Tetley triplizes, more kids than Barney 
 Never need for stress there's three bags of sess 
 A damn I rest, playing chess, yes 
 My thoughts be sneaky like a crook from Brooklyn 
 When you ain't lookin', I take the queen, with the rook then 
 I get vexed, layin phat trax on Ampex 
 Morphous God, gettin' drunk, off a Triple X 
 Violent time, I got more love than valentines 
 The violent mind, I blast with a silent nine 
 Verse Two: Inspector Deck 
 My hazardous thoughts to cut the mic's life support short 
 Brains get stained like tablecloths when I let off 
 Powerful, poetry pushed past the point of no return 
 Leavin' mics with third-degree burns 
 Let me at 'em, I cramp your style like a spasm 
 Track 'em through the mud then I bag em 
 We're screaming hardcore, hip-hop drips out my balls 
 And I be raw, for four score plus seven more 
 I strike like a bowling ball, holding y'all hostage 
 Like hail, electrifying the third rail 
 Peep the smash on paragraphs of ruckus 
 Wu-Tang (Clan ain't nuttin ta fuck wit) 
 Verse Three: Method Man 
 Hot time, summer in the city 
 My people represent, get busy 
 The heat-seeker, on a mission from hell's kitchen 
 I gets in where I fits in for head-touchin, listen 
 Enemy, is the industry got me flippin 
 I don't give a fuck tell that bitch and a nigga 
 I'm killin', snipin, catchin murder cases 
 Desert Storm-in, I be searchin for oasis 
 As I run a mile with a racist 
 Pullin, swords, hit the Billboard with a bullet 
 Peace to the number seven 
 Everybody else get the fo'-nine-three-eleven 
 (Mr. Sandman bring me a good dream) 
 I don't know what's going on 
 If you can take us there... 
 Verse Four: Street Thug 
 Yo, watch me bang the headpiece there's no survival 
 My flow lights up the block like a homicidal 
 Murder, underground beef for the burger 
 P.L.O., criminal thoughts you never heard of 
 I switch, the city never sleeps, life's a bitch 
 I shit, runnin' through bitches like Emmitt Smith 
 Caution, niggaz best to be careful crossin 
 The street, before they end up layin in a coffin 
 Don't sleep, niggaz tend to forget, however 
 Peep this -- my nigga Case lives forever 
 Verse Five: Carlton Fisk 
 What evil lurks in the heart of men? 
 It be the shadow, street-life, flowin again 
 I had a plot, scheme, I knew for sure 
 Only one kid would knock the hinges off the door 
 The jerk tried to jet, Sabrina at his neck 
 Thirteen pounds on the table plus a tec 
 Just when I said, ""Where the fuck's the cream?"" 
 Another jerk came out the kitchen with the M-16 
 He tried to cock it, blast these shots like, rockets 
 Crushed his collarbone, ripped his arm out the socket 
 My move for the table was swift, I got my hostage 
 (The nigga tried to stab you God!) but I dodged it 
 Niggaz said, ""Carlton youse a ill motherfucker"" 
 'Cause I made it look like they both killed each other 
 And I'm out 
 (Mr. Sandman bring me a good dream) 
 (Mr. Sandman bring me a good dream)"

14,Method Man,hiphop,Perfect World,"(Dialogue) 
 First, they dropped the bomb 
 Then came the disease 
 Then death 
 This our world 
 Your world, my world 
 I like this world! 
 Yo, on foreign land keep your toast up, hot rocks 
 Catch a close up your snot box, broke up 
 Land shark, tryin' to post up, reptiles 
 Trying to throw cub with crooked smiles 
 Take your kindness for weakness, yhey foul 
 New York niggas be lovin' how the gun talk, POW! 
 Another underboss pull a doublecross 
 Niggas ain't ready for the holocaust here and now 
 Want them games people play, catch these bullets over Broadway 
 Twenty-five to life up in Rahway get caught 
 Look deep into the black thought, a holy war is being fought 
 On Allah's court, my perfect world (if you will) 
 Mr. Sandman, bring 'em a dream, infa-red light beams 
 Homicide scene, perfect world 
 By any means get cream 
 Just don't let it come between you and I, seen 
 Everything is everything in this three ringed, circus 
 Peoples is swift, tryin' to work us, lord 
 With devil worship and satanic verses 
 It takes place in the world, perfect, mine and yours 
 Heard when it rains, it pours 
 I came to bring the pain once more (once more) 
 Pedal to the floor, peep the Jim Crow law 
 The Big Apple, rotten to the core 
 These niggaz want war? (GIVE EM WAR) 
 They schemin and I-Beam'n 
 Hitmen like cryin freeman, they need cleanin 
 Keep it comin' till they all runnin', screamin, bloody murder 
 At war with them inner demons, it's goin' down 
 Invasion, U.S.A., spittin' rounds 
 If these shells hit the battleground, pave the way 
 For birth of a Generation, X 
 Spoken with a project dialect, bomb threat 
 To the air waves, hit the deck 
 Pressed for time in a world lacking sunshine 
 Got love for my family, 'cause they mine 
 See niggaz dying in the streets over petty crimes 
 We gonna eat, or die tryin', got my mind made up 
 Young buck, just don't give a fuck, pressin they luck 
 When they best, best to give it up, perfect world 
 Baby what? Nigga head or gut, them or us 
 Welcome to the dark ages, dirty pages 
 Of filth, fine filth flavors 
 Dust to dust, and ashes to ashes, life flashes 
 Right before his eyes, then he passes 
 While the 666 got more tricks 
 Than the PD's got bricks 
 From bloods and crips 
 To pips with mints 
 We still lickin' the scars from whips on slave ships 
 Mr. Sandman, bring 'em a dream, infa-red light beams 
 Homicide scene, perfect world 
 By any means get cream 
 Just don't let it come between you and I, seen 
 Everything is everything in this three ringed, circus 
 Peoples is swift, tryin' to work us, lord 
 With devil worship and satanic verses 
 It takes place in the world, perfect, mine and yours

 And Wu-Tang is for the babies!"

 Rock a bye baby from the rooftop 
 When the guns blow, your cradle gets rocked 
 When the earth quakes and the sky starts to fall 
 Down will come emcees, fake shit and all! 
 Verse One: Method Man 
 On top I be the show shot 
 The bomb drop 
 After shot blow your bumba claat to smithereens 
 Time stop, flyin' guillotines 
 Commin for your flock 
 What you mean you spilled the beans, ay? 
 Black out and thought I seen pop 
 Lazer beam glock 
 What's a bird to a brother with a flock, wha? 
 They got some nerve 
 To even try and shit a turd 
 On John J, flap a nigga gate 
 With the wordplay 
 Hot Nik shoot you with the gift 
 It's your birthday 
 God hatin' ugly in the worst way 
 Fuck 'em like the Earth say 
 From first day I survey the hassle 
 Death knockin' at your door 
 In the Big Apple 
 Meth rotton to the core 
 Shackle, in the sound castle 
 The doungeon, with vermin 
 In the form of emcees determined 
 To step foot on God soil 
 Not knowin' that these egg heads come hard boiled 
 And heavy handed 
 The aliens they just landed 
 And you in the way 
 Overthrow these niggas planet 
 Independance Day 
 Felons, get split melons 
 Homicide buck niggas get the buck with pelets 
 Insecticide

 Got juice very fine 
 Turn me loose on mankind 
 Detionate the land mine 
 Funk gets me goin' now 
 Never sell, never sold 
 Live by the code now 
 Never tell, never told 
 Darts I throw 
 Like Clyde with the finger roll 
 Clut shots an what not 
 This is where the buck stops 
 Still can't eat and y'all still can't sleep 
 I eat up my ?self? as presidential emcee 
 Wu-Tang killa bee 
 The bee high facility 
 In love with the blunt smoke 
 Even though its killin' me 
 Bad vibes fillin me 
 With thoughts of conspiricy 
 White Water scandals with Bill Clinton Hilary 
 Too hot to handle 
 Well put together to dismantle 
 Fucka, you heard me?

 She pressed up, grabbed my dick, threw her dress up 
 Cocked her legs, cold fucked my head up 
 Now I'm deep in it, flyin past the speed limit 
 Out of control, still whippin it, steadily hittin it 
 Deep strokin, one hand on the wheel, blunt smokin' 
 Lovin' how it feel, Sweet Love you got me open, what? 
 (Cappadonna) 
 Love is love Love, love is love Love 
 Love is love Love, love is love Love 
 We connected like a train from the first ordeal 
 I stepped to her with the passion as I kept things real 
 But like, sex was on my mind like, cum was in my pants 
 I flashed my fronts on her, like if I had a chance 
 She said, ""Ain't you Cappadonna from the Wu-Tang Clan?"" 
 I said, ""Yeah, mad gear plus the small white band 
 Sweet Love, I want your pussy can I be your man? 
 Stripped to the bare essentials let me fuck you if I can 
 Sweet Love, from your nipples to your pussy nub"" 
 Sweet Love, love is Love, love is love Love 
 (Method Man) 
 It's a full moon, we in the bedroom, thoughts consumed 
 By the passion, slow jam tunes and body action 
 My finger's on the clit splashin, your pussy lips 
 Got you spazzin, love juices, marinatin 
 In your satins, sexy ass, I get some like my old dad 
 I love my women bad, with just a little touch of class 
 Youse the Star by far, look at you Ma 
 Shake your thang-thang girlfriend, you SheShe Lefrea! 
 Whattup, went to beat it up, I'm not the one to eat it up 
 But the type to hit it raw dawg and seed it up 
 We talk without sayin' nuttin, you told me if I came through 
 You'd gimme som'in, now we lockin ass 
 Pullin hair and talkin' trash, how you like it 
 Slow or fast? She said, ""I like it when it last"" 
 No doubt, you got the best trout there can be 
 Not an everyday, average, Chicken of the Sea, candidate for H.I.V. 
 You'd rather deal with monogamy 
 Queen to be held, Black Mahogany 
 You're bout to bust damnit, sugar walls comin' down 
 Now you can't stand it, you've been touched 
 That's when I felt the blood rush 
 Gettin' closer and closer with every thrust, take me there 
 Volcano's about to erupt, I love you much

 Famished from lack of eatin' and lack of teachin' 
 Banished from rhyme and reason for high treason

 Slide like water rats through the Staten Resevoir 
 Swingin' swords cut your mic cords, snatch your rap awards 
 Commercial cats, fuckin' up the game, that's why I crash boards 
 Drape floors while you Jordan, keep on tryin' yours 
 Hardcore, somethin' that my street niggaz is dyin' for

 Snap your neck and the dopefiend, Gobol 13 
 Professionals we know things, say no more 
 Check my Dogs at the Resevoir, gourmet special of the day 
 Is nigga souflee, pusher gotta pay 
 And the games people play, John Jay back around the way 
 Fish filet, Mr. DJ, turn it up a notch 
 Hit the replay, for dirt bomb niggaz in the PJ 
 To cling-on, bring-on, the good times, to key-on 
 Hook rhymes that's be-yond, your thinkin', for eons 
 I been here, to shine on the black mind 
 Tell you like the last time, year of the grimy nigga 
 Ragtime, bad sign, flatline..."

 Deadly melodic, robotic steez-o blur your optic 
 So you can't see the topic, condition combo 
 Blaze bring the heat to your Mourning like Alonzo 
 Head honcho like Eastwood, gun in my pancho 
 Another bad desperado, trapped inbetween 
 The hills and the El Dorados, but you can't do that 
 Welcome to the Wheel of Fortune where Pat don't Sajak 
 Bring it to these cats often, the biggest payback 
 Is when I condemn men, to purgatory 
 Stick a pen, do 'em in, eight million stories 
 In the naked Mr. Method, Blade Runner 
 Blood stain on my track record, top gunner 
 Chorus: Method Man 
 You know it's sick now, just a little bit, aw shit 
 Can't quit now, hard as a brick, what's this 
 Make 'em get down, head where I fit, more grip 
 Hold this shit down, she don't know you better school her

 Jealous men don't understand and get clapped on, now I'm reloadin

 Bust flows and never lay text/latex without my Trojan 
 Hand writtin ass whippin, I keep spittin' 
 At any head-on collision, throw dart wit precision 
 And split decision, tell your old folk 
 And your children what I'm dealin'

 Never liked son from day one, bring you tool 
 That nigga stick you and play dumb, hate a bitch-ass 
 Who care where you came from, you ain't prepared 
 For when the pain come, this nigga scared, shook to death 
 From a cold stare, stuntin, knowin' my brothers fiend 
 To do you somethin' over here, we head huntin 
 In the function I smell fear, adrenaline start pumpin 
 I Smash Pumpkins, Hard Rock be in the Cafe 
 Tear the club up, and anyone that try to judge us 
 The last days, makin' sure I get the last say 
 In the food chain, is you predator or prey? 
 If you featherweight, lyrics blow your back 
 Crack your vertabrae, lookin' for a better way 
 To get my point across, thoughts accelerate 
 At the same speed, of the murder rate 
 Lord, never perpetrate a fraud, till my nigga Carlton Fisk 
 See the boss, truly yours, Mr. Meth

 Life's a snippet, one way ticket 
 Time tickin fast, blink you might miss it 
 Semen on Street shit, you might catch fifty stitches

 One hand holds the head of the last brave man 
 Made man, Cuban Link chain of command 
 Authorized fam', hot like Sahara sand

 High beams flash, promoters die behind CREAM 
 Get your face blown, might face the chrome 
 We take this more serious than just a poem 
 (Havoc) 
 I think about a lot of shit, especially when I'm bent 
 About the foul shit goin' on in my life, current event 
 It's evident I smoke ciggarette down to Brownsville 
 Thinkin' to myself -- how many lives must my pound kill? 
 Hopefully none, ain't the one to give chase 
 Hemmed by Jake, worryin who might turn state's 
 So I chill, put my killa niggaz on the battlefield 
 On the low plottin silent murderer, never doubt still 
 Never follow beef hey beef follow me 
 Wanna settle in the court I say settle in the streets 
 Like our pops did it, you got gats get hot with it 
 Now you dry snitchin, because you got knocked with it 
 I just rock with it, go with the flow, think for a hot minute 
 Stash my dough secure the funds of profit 
 (Prodigy) 
 Yo, extreme rhyme niggaz, you wastin your time 
 Fuckin' with my niggaz, extraordinary line swishin 
 Your mind out position, tryin' to figure this shit 
 Rewind it and listen quick, you might miss this 
 Olympic, rap jave-lon, travel beyond, your weak song 
 Doin' this for too long, to not come strong 
 You're only a pawn of Viet Dong 
 Tryin' to form against mines, you musta just been born 
 Secluded on a distant farm 
 This is the real world, where niggaz get shot and shanked 
 Where there's tremendous pain, you get your frame inflamed 
 Crushed to dust, by the next man's clutch 
 It's Infamous you fucks, intense bad luck... 
 Chorus One 
 Stand strong on our two feet, we all ready 
 For a war here, fuck peace, what?

 Takin' the ghetto right, slidin in your wife on a rainy night 
 Low budget nigga wanna act like, yousa killa in the spotlight 
 But never lived the life? 
 Throw the grilla in your mouthpiece, rock you to sleep 
 Fuckin' wit Street, you better travel wit heat, speakin' my piece 
 You survived my attempt to homicide 
 Tried to slide and lit five rounds but hit the building side 
 This is how it's goin' down, ain't no peace until you're gone 
 Play around, with your life playa you won't live long 
 Probably got a vest on, but your thoughts react like a young pawn 
 That's when I swarm on your street dreams you mor-on 
 Carry on, forty lead dons went through your Teflon 
 I remained calm, even though you straight passed through my left arm 
 I never fold I reload, keep my clip full mode 
 Empty out six slick, to bloody up your wardrobe 
 Plus that click you run with, I heard y'all niggaz rub dicks 
 Greet niggaz with a French kiss, some real fag shit 
 Seen the bitch in you, from the first day you came through 
 Saw the size of my crew, and started actin' brand new 
 That bullshit you pulled, you gon' pay too 
 You went bubblin blue, it's dead on the avenue 
 I bailed you out, passed off a key to the stash house 
 So you could lay low, from your P.O., before you mashed out 
 Then you went the wrong route, that's why I threw my dick 
 In your girl's mouth 
 Get snuffed the fuck out, walk witcha guns out 
 I'll see you nigga

 This raw rebel got more metal than pop 
 And rock groups, when my glock shoots the scores settled

 Mr. Meth, you're so Def, you put them other M.C.'s out to rest (that's right) 
 And they test (uh-huh), but they forget (yeah) how the M-E-F is so Def (let's go) 
 (Method Man) 
 Yo, uh, come on, come on, now 
 Big Meth attack soon as the track come on now 
 Zone out, with Sean Combs and bizzy-bone out (I see you in the club) 
 And by one, I'm gettin' thrown out 
 Mami, got her toes out, ain't one army can Blaze Johnny 
 Like Gwen Stafani, you know there's No Doubt 
 I'm trill, sick with it, it's like ill 
 That's the only way to explain these mic skills 
 On Homicide Hill, anybody asks is real 
 The more steel, the more bodybags to fill 
 Can I get, hit of that hydro, nigga 
 I tried to quit puffin' before, but I'm no quitter 
 If honey show me her buns, I'll show her my ones 
 If the bed rockin', keep knockin' and I'mma cum 
 Want some, take some, I get it crunk 
 Speak junk, I'll slow up your road with speed bumps 
 (Chorus: Missy Elliott w/ P. Diddy doing ad-libs) 
 When they play this in the club (say what?) 
 Go and tell that nigga, bump that (say what?) 
 Throw your hands up, like nigga, what? (say what?) 
 Y'all don't really really want that (say what?) 
 And for whatever muthafucka, don't like it (say what?) 
 Tell that sucka he can get back (say what?) 
 Misdemeanor and Meth in your area (say what?) 
 Are y'all ready? Come on, play it back (saw what?) 
 (Method Man) 
 You wanna front, what? Step up and get bucked 
 And if your feelin' lucky, duck, then press y'all luck 
 Y'all got me effed up, over tracks overreact 
 Once I start, like a bullet, ain't no holdin' me back 
 I'm all that and two mac's, y'all fakin' jacks 
 When I cock back like Busta Bust and make 'em clap 
 Here I go again, who blow in like whirlwinds 
 Who kiss girlfriends, that kiss they girlfriends 
 Got to get it, and when I'm gone 
 Y'all bury me with chrome, and tell hell I'm comin' home 
 I'm poison, see my skull and crossbones 
 Got aim like them kids in Iraq who toss stones 
 And I got drugs in my system, we thugs in the system 
 That put slugs in victims, Mr. M-E to F, bomb threat 
 As long as I ain't no game, there's no contest 
 (Method Man) 
 Ticallion is phatter than your fattest chrome chain 
 I guess that should explain why I given the dope name 
 Ain't nothin' free, everything got a fee 
 How the fuck you got a car and ain't got a pot to pee? 
 I'ma grown man, so I do grown man things 
 Why take half, when I can have this whole damn thing? 
 It's Meth, baby, drop top, navy Mercedes 
 I'm number one like P.E. or Tracy McGrady 
 It's all good, everything I spit, all hood 
 And if y'all gave me one wish, niggaz, I wish y'all would 
 Who John Blaze? Uh, when y'all gon' learn huh 
 When I burn son, stick a fork in him he's done 
 And ladies love to play, like Ladies Love Cool J 
 For the right CREAM, the'll do anything you say 
 She Ice Cream, I'm caked up with icing 
 Mr. Sandman, come on, bring her a pipe dream 
 (Outro: P. Diddy) 
 Let's work... come on 
 Def Jam! Mr. Meth, Missy, Bad Boy 
 Hitmen baby, let's work, come on 
 Let's work, come on, yeah 
 Uh, let's work... aiyo pass that nigga

 These niggaz try'nna see how I come ash again 
 Main and evident, I'm huntin', yes, Meth for president 
 Be in hell with Dazel and George just for the hell of it 
 And I ain't yellow kid, flows hot as kettle get 
 Now if you ain't fuckin' with that, you must be celibate 
 Spaz! Just a little, got a sack lookin' fizzle 
 Little hash in the middle, where it at? In the middle, yup 
 Mommy if you got a fat ass, make it jiggle, yup 
 Put it in my next video shot by Little X 
 And M-E-F gon' work till their ain't any left 
 I'm tryin' get what I'm worth and not a penny less 
 Think fast (come on) bank cash (come on) 
 Everybody do it with your stank ass (just come on)

 Make you rob somebody (what?) grab somebody (what?) 
 Stomp somebody (what?) slap somebody (what?) 
 Make you wanna step to the bar and sip Bacardi (what?) 
 Wild out, spaz in the club, we in the party (what?)

 Yeah... let 'em talk, nigga, come on Bust 
 (Aiyo, Meth, let me get at these niggaz) Yeah! 
 (Busta Rhymes) 
 Now watch me back your shit up, I hope your people pull up 
 And pick up and pack your shit up, homey, it's time to move 
 While I'm singin', ma, do you let relieve you of all of your 
 Figure seating sketching, never believe in your niggaz (come on!) 
 Go head and babble you can watch me patiently waiting 
 Aimin', attackin', instead I'mma let one of my bitches slap you 
 I ain't watch you when your niggaz'll try 
 To feel a wrath of the un-rudely waking of a sleeping giant 
 (Very defiant), once I give you the pressure 
 And then I apply it and then your breathing is stop and totally quiet (sss... 
 Oh) 
 Captain of this ship, so call me the pilot 
 I leave you and your crew to collide with me 
 Die, stomp on a nigga, just like a herd of a thousand cattle 
 That'll travel over your face and frazzle your shit 
 Shot you, worst than a brick and then be torturin' you 
 And then get the reverend, and get to steppin', nigga! 
 This shit'll make you... 
 (Chorus: Busta Rhymes)

 Can't you see what I got for you now 
 (Shake your big fat ass in front of me now) 
 To all my high bidders (to all my live niggaz) 
 {We here to blackout, follow the story now 
 Just feel my heat, and you know I'm gonna 
 Just keep the street, but nigga did you 
 Know when you bout to lose it, my nigga 
 And you know we gon' get real stupid, my nigga}

 See the police coming (what?) Fireman coming (what?) 
 Street niggaz ready to riot and start dummin' (what?) 
 I love to see it, whenever you and your man frontin' (what?) 
 Me and Meth'll step to you, quick! And smash somethin' (what?)

 Now who is he? Dope M.C. killin' these cowards 
 Wack niggaz get pimp slapped, give me some powder 
 Click-clack, one in your back, now think about it 
 Get back, runnin' your gap, I can't allow it

 Well every nigga (set it off) you know we seeing it through God 
 The streets be needing niggaz like me and you, God 
 Aiyo, I think we're up, seen it from here, we got a mile, yo 
 Logical, we should have done this shit a long time ago 
 (Method Man) 
 I got that shit that make rappers shit in they shoes 
 Nasty M.C., I spit flows and spit in they food

39,Method Man,hiphop,The Motto,"(Intro: Method Man) 
 Yo... aww shhhhhhiiiiiiit! 
 (Hook: Method Man) 
 My niggaz, how we do it? You know it like a poet, baby doll 
 Break through it, you know it like a poet, baby doll 
 I spit, chew it, you know it like a poet, baby doll 
 Get in the music, you know it like a poet, baby doll 
 (Method Man) 
 If you don't know, you better, ask somebody who I be 
 On land, air, or sea, I don't need No I.D. 
 Once again, let's get under their skins like I.V.'s 
 Or Roman numerals fours (IV's) who we doin' this for? 
 I got a shoe in the door, nothin' new anymore 
 Y'all got love for me? I got love for you and yours 
 Tical Part 0, my friend, rappers is fightin' 
 Like Tyson, when nothin' else work I'll start bitin' 
 My shit, and his shit, I'm hopin' it end 
 I live my life like a lotto ticket, hopin' it win 
 Purple haze got me chokin' again, open again 
 I'm what's crackin', like your mamma smokin' again... And 
 (Chorus: Method Man) 
 If you see a model, then you might see me follow 
 Rubbin' her thighs like Aladdin rub the Genie bottle 
 Back for another swallow, Method, you know my motto: 
 ""Y'all might just win today, but I'll be back tomorrow"" 
 (Method Man) 
 How should I get this started? 
 Fuck it, just get it started 
 Who on the short yellow bus tryin' to get retarded? 
 Kid don't be the artist, formerly known as artist 
 Jump off a skyscraper, to see who hit the hardest 
 Where the bastards at and where they habitats? 
 I send they asses back to foldin' sweaters at the Gap 
 I like Nikes, food spicy, I'm a Pisces 
 That's why women love me and any nigga that's like me 
 Thoroughbread, I'm with gettin' this dough instead 
 Need a ho, like I need another hole in the head 
 Lord help me, I'm crackin' the safe, pocket like Face 
 Mighty Healthy, you know I'm the shit, soon as you smelt me 
 (Method Man) 
 For what it's worth, the early bird sit at the table and eat first 
 My niggaz need work, mommy buggin', rippin' my t-shirt 
 We can kick it until our feet hurt 
 Mothers warn your daughters 'bout this tall drink of water 
 Spoiler, waiter give her anything she order on the menu 
 Method Man, live at your venue 
 Smokin' it, jumpin' off of shit, like he meant to 
 Kid, I got a murder rap, and my head is simple 
 Open up the pussy, put the lead in the pencils 
 And people sayin' Wu gon' break up, y'all 
 We got y'all numbers, it's time y'all got your wake up calls, and..."
40,Method Man,hiphop,We Some Dogs,"(Chorus: Kon Artis - repeat 2X) 
 If I'm a dog, then we some dogs 
 We all gunna chase cats, tell them dog 
 Girl don't waste that swallow it all 
 We just some dogs, we just some dogs 
 (Method Man) 
 By any means necessary, it's on 
 Bitch, your fucking with a dog, all I wanna do is bury some bones 
 Take a piss on a tree and I'm gone, girlfriend don't get it wrong 
 I hate to be the one to shit on your lawn, but I ain't got my dog license 
 I ain't nothing nice, and I ain't never met a piece of pussy I ain't liking 
 Sugar and spicing, kicked up with ice and, you can do anything with these hoes 
 Except housewife them, like snoop said ""it ain't nothing but a G thing"" 
 Got a bitch in my bed, in nothing but a g-string, so peep game 
 Who the lucky female to taste these, snips and snails and puppy dog tails huh? 
 You're messing with me, I'm messing with you, I'm a dog trick 
 I chase cats like Peppy La Pu, dead on shit 
 My life's like a Holiday Inn, if my girl act up 
 I'm gunna fuck her friend, if I'm a what... 
 (Redman) 
 I'm a dog motherfucker, I walk on all fours 
 Find where you live at, shit on your porch, Redman is hungry 
 Don't leave the food out, I'm pumped like a Pamela Anderson boob job 
 Straight up bulldog, mixed with a Shizhsu 
 'Cause I bullshit, party a little bit 
 Swim with the shark, you're bound to drown 
 My weed is like green, and yours brown 
 The doctor the dog, from Cali to Georgia 
 When cats meow with noting on top they halter 
 I don't have Yemen that laugh when I laugh 
 We some dogs, we can kiss our own ass 
 Like a golden retriever, retrieving the chronic 
 The dose nose bitch, and no need to hide it - Redman a flirt 
 Always get my nuts stuck to the porch, like the dog on Joe Dirt 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Fish don't fry in the kitchen, bitch don't climb, keep bitching 
 Beans don't burn on the grill, 3, 4, 5 
 With the pimping, hoes get your pimps permission 
 Now pay attention, the big D-O double to the G-O 
 To the liquor store to crack a hoe and get some VO (VO) 
 And mix it with some pena colidino 
 Then slip it on the bitch then I dip with all her c-notes 
 Scandalous, yep bitch 'cause we know 
 Every pretty hoe always down to pull a d-low 
 On me? No, so there wont be no shaking me down, breaking me down, here we go 
 You know I'm just oh so slick 
 The way you chew that bubble gum, the way you sucking a dick 
 And I can tell, that you a freak 
 I wanna stick some dick up in you can I skeet, skeet 
 Don't you know why? 
 (Chorus] [Repeating till fade)"

 Yeah, ah, yeah, yo, yo, yeah 
 Yeah, motivate, motivate, from the gate, y'all 
 Yeah, aiyo, aiyo, aiyo 
 (Raekwon) 
 And we the Gods, still tear the whole hood apart 
 Darts that'll splatter through faces, taste niggaz hearts 
 I'm intellectual, plus professional 
 And Walbaums to vegetables 
 Shit is right here, like buyin' fly gear 
 Dare any white man or fan nigga, ran through niggaz 
 Blew shotties in niggaz lobbies, the grand RZA 
 We left, the radio broke, I yoke my vocals, hittin' green smoke 
 Allah Math', show me when the needle broke 
 Numb the whole crowd up, stupid ass Loud fouled up 
 Never knew what they had, now they proud of us 
 Picture my vision, precision, lines jumpin' out of commission 
 Divine got me, nigga, the boss, he pop me 
 Rae, we gotta generate, lord, I feel the Ditech, the mildew 
 Buy jets and vehicles, steal a little 
 Wrap up the whole rap government 
 (Method Man) 
 Go head, y'all floss wit it 
 Walk wit, I slap your boss wit it 
 Navy blue, New York fitted, I'm cold frost bitted 
 Two puffs and off wit it 
 You smell the herb, 'fore I lit the spots its forfeit it 
 Blocks is hot, feel the shot from fourth/fifth it 
 With no regard for your boulevard, just the shit bag and bullet scar 
 It's the Riddler, riddle me this, riddle me that 
 Who the pretender? And who the door man that let them enter? 
 The Wu-Tang, 36 Cham', what you smokin'? 
 Got you in the game chokin', like Van Gundy coachin' 
 Your street team, bunch of weaklings 
 Don't ever let me catch your reachin' 
 Respect when a grown man is speakin' 
 Shh, keep on sleepin', and just like TLC, I keep on ""creepin"" 
 The five percent of y'all, keep on teachin' 
 The heat seakin', missile official, that got issues 
 Like Funk Doc got snot tissue, it's Hott Nikkels 
 ""Everywhere I turn, I see, your face, but you're never there"" 
 (Method Man) 
 Shh... shit ain't over... 
 Okay, now, same shit, different day, grindin', gettin' paid 
 Self at it, automatic, guns that spit and spray 
 Gotta have it, ass grab it, time to slip and weight 
 Godbody, House your Party, watch the Kid N Play 
 Y'all gon' make me go postal, up in this muthafucka house 
 Full of bloodsuckers and hoes that love hustlers 
 Roll that izza, pour me another kizza 
 Bigga, to my nigga, so drunk they can't get up 
 Shotguns through nose, hot ones through foes 
 Let the herb spots run till the cops come, suppose 
 I was just another stick in the mud, on a Saturday 
 Thinkin', how I'mma get the fifth in the club 
 See my crew thick, everyday I fights to prove it 
 We comes undisputed, with batteries included 
 Honey's ""bee"" like Meth, I be like what? 
 They want some free CD's, I'm like ""see these"" nuts 
 (Outro: Method Man) 
 If y'all muthafuckas gettin' high tonight, say all right, haha

 Ya gotta be, down with the cause before ya come

 What do you expect from me (uh huh, uh huh) 
 I know of those promises, of love and affection (come on, steady good ma) 
 There's something about you, that's got me going (uh huh, uh huh) 
 But is it worth not knowing if you're gonna be around (now, now)

 Who the fuck is your daddy, and who your king girl 
 Are you unhappily married, don't see no wind girl 
 Soul sister, can't get ya ta hail witch-ya

 I feel your slurpin', slurpin, I'm skeetin' and squirtin' your tongue 
 And I got about 5 grand, but I won't be spendin' a dime 
 See 'cause overspendin's a crime and I can't be spendin' my time

 They wanna raise that pussy tab, price and position 
 Enticin' these women, given the proper juice

 If you girl come knockin' at my door, it's my duty 
 To give her what she came here for 
 I'm try'nna knock it down, but I ain't try'nna claim that dough 
 Come on, now, baby, come on-on 
 That's what's up, start the fire, Buddha, light things up 
 The only nigga puttin' ends on some rims for his ice cream truck 
 Pick a flavor, I'll come and scoop your whole team up 
 Come on, now, baby, come on-on 
 That's how it be, don't trip, but girl you put a hurtin' on me 
 Oh shit, hope other chicks don't take it personally 
 But ma, you killin' her, murder in the first degree 
 Come on, now, baby, come on-on 
 Okay, okay, can the ladies come out and play with Mr. Meth 
 I ain't trynna take you out your way 
 Why break me off tomorrow, when you can break me off today

 Yo, yo, yo...

 It's the unstoppable, overcome any obstacle 
 Y'all know my flavor, pack more punch than Tropical 
 Any mission possible, do what I gots to do 
 Labels gettin' butterfingers, and next they droppin' you 
 You think you know, but you have no idea 
 The Diary of a Meth Man, what's this I hear? 
 Somebody told y'all, steppin' in shit was good luck? 
 I got the hood stuck, chh-chh, now give the goods up 
 Y'all done pushed up, past the point of no return 
 It's Meth's turn, so roll that shit up and let's burn 
 I heard Philly got the best 'scherm, out in Cali, they got the best perms 
 Now that we know, when will the rest learn? 
 Come on, each one, teach one, hear no evil, and I don't speak none 
 Everything cool until that heat come 
 Just call my name, and I'll be there 
 Y'all kids is slum, like the jewelry in Albi Square

 We drinkin' Henny till we flip, poppin' bottles till we sick 
 All y'all haters eat a dick (yeah, uh)

 Man, I'm in the house like foreclosures 
 Talk sober, until some dog gets forced over 
 New York soldiers, be at ease, fall back 
 Never ever, I'm the New Era, like ball caps 
 Kid, whenever, whoever, whatever, y'all want it 
 Y'all can have it, the problem and answer, I'm all that 
 While we at it, let's tighten up our grips around that cabbage 
 Silly rabbit, how many kid's done tricked you on your carrots 
 The product of a bad package, like Bishop Don Juan it's Magic 
 How I break 'em like a bad habit, hit tracks like it's target practice 
 Then let these darts take a stab at it 
 Niggaz ain't got it, ain't never had it 
 I jam like L.A. traffic, Jellyroll behind the wheel 
 And the passenger seat behind the field 
 It's your boy, physically fit, mentally sick 
 Get dirty money, told you honey, I'm filthy rich 
 (Hook 2X w/o ""fire"" the second time)

 Yeah, y'all niggaz don't know it's a game 
 Until it starts again, let's do it, haha!

 Six minutes, Method Man, you're on 
 If you thinkin' you gon' slip and be all right, you're wrong 
 You can see me lightin' the bong, while writin' the songs 
 That the crowd, is either singin' to or fightin' along, fightin' along 
 I'm try'nna tell you drugs is not your friends 
 And girlfriend, don't try and front like you got your friend 
 I'm at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn 
 And my chick's a man-eater, she be swallowin' men 
 Aight, live from New York, it's Saturday night 
 I got pipes that drain your confidence, and battery light 
 Aight, mami tight, but she ain't really my type 
 If y'all don't see me treat her right, then she ain't really my wife 
 When I was young, I was stayin' in school, obeyin' rules 
 Play with my food, what makes you think I'm playin' with you? 
 This is it, y'all better come on in, the water's fine 
 Jump on in, let's do it to 'em one more 'gain 
 (Outro: Method Man) 
 Yeah, Ladies Love Big John Studd 
 No doubt, dick up in your mouth

 Unless it's Gilla House, and Wu-Tang Clan, in the house, cop them thangs 
 Live together and (pop the chain), know your lane 
 Fuck cocaine, stick up, bout to blow your brains off the map

 And tell whatever chick that I'm with, slap your broad 
 This is it, (I'm stuck with y'all) and y'all stuck with me 
 In the lap of luxury, where the hell's cut for free 
 And the kid (can't fuck with y'all) Till I got a tree 
 On some new property, at my new pot to pee, have mercy

 Soon as you put them automatics on safety that's it 
 I calm them bastards, I call them ratchets 
 Till you blasted, till y'all come ashes to ashes

 You either up or down, don't get that ass kicked 
 Y'all niggaz fuck around, y'all only tough around 
 The crowds, scared to bust a round, don't get that ass kicked 
 What part of the game is this? 
 I came to break bread, evidently y'all killas came to bitch, nigga 
 So, whose the whipped nigga, don't even trip, nigga 
 Some say they pull trigga, I think they bullshitter 
 I just begun to fight, if mommy like daddy talk 
 Then daddy might get him some tonight 
 Give me, my limelight, give me, my five mics 
 Give me, some weed and a light to get my mind right 
 Is he, the illest M.C., to ever play the tough city 
 To find out it'll cost you 'bout a buck fifty 
 Across your face swiftly, my after taste shitty 
 Whose built by New Yitty, whose milked like two titties 
 And I ain't even got to say my name 
 I got this duck wit her legs up like, ""say my name, trick"" 
 You think it's all a game, like pussy all the same 
 I'm speakin' toilet slang, not seakin' hall of fame 
 It's raw, sushi, stain in your drawers, dooky 
 Quarter a Lucy, quarter more for a groupie 
 That like to pop snoopy, think she gon' pop coochie 
 Just 'cause you got Gucci, don't mean you not hoochie 
 Girl, I tell it like a T-I-N 
 Ain't no other kids eatin' till I feed my kids 
 Trick, oh, you ain't crushin', sister, I can't do nothin' wit you 
 My money's celebate, honey, and we ain't fuckin' wit you 
 I do it for the nookie, some say I'm too pushy 
 Only thing better than pussy, that's some new pussy 
 There that go, looky, it's gettin' ugly even

 Y'all already know of my strength already growin' 
 And this game many may come but few are chosen 
 I don't usually do this, but keep the party going like 
 ""Damn right everybody get some act right"" 
 I get tips from BIG and Pac when they blastin' the heat 
 If you's a rapper, don't ever ride the passenger seat 
 One to grow on 
 When up shit's creek, you get your roll on 
 Boy I never stop, I go on, so on and so on 
 Rappers can't fuck with me 
 My career's like somebody put glue in your chair and now your stuck with me 
 I don't use pick up lines, I guess I'm just picky

 Whenever I rock, the jam's over crowded 
 I'm never gonna stop, the fans won't allow it

 Yo, get it you got it, if you got it then good 
 ""There's a lot of rappers rappin' but not a lot of 'em could""

 There ain't nothin' but wars in my neck of the woods

 Three young cats strapped with gats decided to ride out one night 
 The in-flight drug used to induce the hindsight was dust 
 The moonlight was robust but they couldn't see the beauty in it 
 Their duty in it was to carry out another senseless killin' 
 Senses and feelings distorted they boarded their vessel Nessel 
 Discreet in crotches and underneath seats they tuck heat 
 To complete the mission they had no decision in 
 No longer do they use our light and dark 
 Used to create the vision in our towns 
 But now they red and blue override our brown skin 
 We've been conditioned to let off them rounds when we see another color rag 
 Or, hear another brother brag about what set he claimin 
 Poverty, drugs and poor education should be the target 
 But we won't stay gamin that 
 We'll kill and maim another cat like there's no shame in that 
 Like there's fame in that 
 We hang out them car windows and bust them slugs 
 In the name of genocide in disguise, so we don't take blame for that 
 But if there's honor amongst you thieves in life 
 Then what the fuck you hidin for? 
 Recognize your deed to trife and decide what the fuck you ridin' for"

 Is it me, or the industry that really got to change 
 Once again, it's Wu-Tang, in case y'all forgot the name 
 (Method Man) 
 I spit germ, early bird gets worm, now 
 Now that it's his turn, clowns don't get turns, now 
 Fuck with a chick perm, when she get hot, you get burned 
 You see I'm not kidding, knowing these kids learn (kids learn) 
 And and I'm that dude, ah-choo, and allerging to wake jewels 
 Blast if I have to, and y'all don't give me no hassle 
 Who rep Rotten Apple to death and get natural 
 Make hard beats pound like the track do (track do) 
 If you ask me, this raspy voice nigga is nasty 
 Khaki's hanging off of his ass, eyes is glassy 
 That's fucked, that's us, niggaz know where to catch me 
 At 1-800 GET-AT-ME, (get at me) 
 My, flow's, no holds barred, Holy Jahad 
 It's the head nigga in charge, Meth, back on the job 
 Like back in the days, back when, the game was hard 
 And when they reminiscenced over Wu, my God 
 (Method Man) 
 Until these rap niggaz stepped up, checked up, man this game is messed up 
 Next up, you know what it is, don't get it f'd up 
 Meth, what? F.Y.I., you need a heads up 
 And I don't mean to beat you in the head, but (head, but) 
 When you spit that, forget that, I eat these niggaz food 
 And the shit wrapped, where Cliff at? Tell 'em Mr. Meth got his shit back 
 The gift back, sign, sealed, delivered and gift wrapped 
 And when you hear that click-click (click-click) 
 That's real talk, some niggaz will talk to the cops 
 Get killed off, man how did you get caught with all the rocks 
 And still walk, no matter what you mix with a pig 
 You still pork, and money is still forced (still forced) 
 Yeah, that was right on cue, new and improved 
 All these dudes try'nna walk in my shoes, doing my moves 
 But that's cool, 'cause I'ma make it do what it do 
 With this W, like I can I get a ""suu"" motherfuckers?

 Come on... that's my nigga right there... let's do it 
 Never count me out, nigga, just count me in... yeah...

 Look, I ain't came to bone these chicks 
 Not this time, I got a bone to pick, I got a zone to pick 
 Now, who that nigga in the zone and shit 
 Back in the building like he own the bitch, nobody cold as this 
 If I ain't got it, then it don't exist 
 I spit that bird flu, my flows is sick, I'm still as ill as they come 
 Protect Ya Neck, when you dealing with them 
 Now Erick stick a fork in him, he done, hah 
 It boggles the mind, like try'nna 'ketchup' to a bottle of Heinz 
 It's like forensics try'nna follow the crime, they want time 
 And sometime, a nigga had to swallow them dimes 
 While 85 percent swallowing swine, see 
 Wherever he roam, it's all gravy, man, whatever he hone 
 Long as I got myself a Marilyn loan, phillies are better chrome 
 If there's a problem, nigga, let it be known 
 And while I sleep, my bitch be checkin' my phone, 'cause I'm a problem, nigga 
 (Chorus: Method Man) 
 Ease up, or put them g's up 
 Scream at ya frog, nigga leap up (now who got a problem with that?) 
 They need to beast up, nigga, speak up or 
 Forever hold they peace up (if they got a problem with that) 
 Hey you (don't want no problem nigga) Hey you (don't want no problem nigga) 
 Hey you (don't want no problem nigga) Hey you (don't want no problem nigga) 
 Hey you (""Believe, what I say, when I tell ya"" - DMX sample) 
 Yeah, you, nigga, you don't want no problem with that

 Look, my Clan all one in the same 
 Until my name number one in the game, it's not a game, nigga 
 Like Billy Danze, I be running with ""Fame"" 
 Me and my lynch mob coming to hang, it's Wu-Tang for life 
 Hard body, another day in the life 
 Credit his momma now for raising him right, just want the people to know 
 I'm bout to blow, like I'm shaking the dice 
 Making me mad? Nah, y'all making me right, cause y'all was taking me light 
 So let my pen talk and say what he like 
 And have the court system say and indict, I'm O.J. on the mic 
 Liquid plumber, I be laying the pipe 
 And if it's tight, girl, I'm staying tonight 
 Not only raising on the price, on M.C.'ing, but I'm raising the bar 
 And if you scary, nigga, wait in the car 
 Motherfuckers I'm hard, hard as cooked up in mayonaise jars 
 Purple haze, Cuban laid cigars, I'm a problem, nigga 
 (Method Man) 
 E, you know I'm just like that 
 Big baller nigga, just like Shaq, so come on, niggaz 
 If they bust, I better bust right back 
 Meth spit it from the gut, like *gunshot* man down 
 I'm that dude, hands down, stare down 
 I'm past due, for Cash Rule, y'all can't clown 
 I'm bank now, your ass lose, nothing but rhyme

 Knock-knock, who is it, ah shitted

 Somebody done fucked up, now 
 Can you dig it, you'll never stop the kid up in the fitted 
 Live with it, somebody done fucked up 
 (Method Man) 
 Look, I'm cutting corners on these clowns, marijuana and pounds 
 Found with Staten Island niggaz that run up on you with rounds 
 Take a drag, pass it around, guess who back in your town 
 And the crowd vict', with Officer Brown patting him down 
 Shit's thick, thick as harmony grits, 'cause with some thugs 
 Ain't no, harmony bitch, them niggaz probably snitch 
 Y'all be the judge, look what happened to Cocheese 
 What happens when your co-d's is talking to police, you dig? 
 Half a cig, let me fuck with ya wig, although you loving the style 
 They're ain't a pedophile could fuck with the kid 
 Now that I'm back up on my, feet, take it back to the streets 
 In the GM with your BM, in the passenger seat 
 Riding hood, by my hood, ain't no hike in the wood 
 Life is good, it's so good, live it twice if I could 
 Man, it's me, once again it's that Wu-Tang 
 Crushing the shit that you bring, you know how we do things 
 (Method Man) 
 Yo, pulling my shoes up, scuffing my Timbs, back to when? 
 Puffing again, who stunting, cops fucking with them 
 Feeling the blow, goosebumping the skin, and on the scale 
 Of nothing to ten, a ten, man, it's nothing to him 
 See you can tell by how I'm clutching my pen, like Mae Weather touching her chin 
 She stunting, going up in her friend 
 Tell the label give me something to spin, and every light got a price 
 You want a slice, but we ain't cutting you in 
 Man, these fiends know my past work, held a monkey until they back hurt 
 Money talking, wonder what that's worth 
 And MCF, mean Cash First shit, picture the kid 
 On the beach in Hawaii, minus the grass skirt 
 Blast first, ask questions last 
 Black herse, nigga, stretch yo ass, y'all niggaz know what this is 
 It's New Yitty, this ain't just a fad 
 It's M-E-F, and I ain't Biggie, but I'm just as Bad, Boy

 Yeah, Big M-E-F, Staten Island Advance, motherfuckers 
 Word up, don't ever count me out, just count me the fuck in

 All daying, knawimsayin', I'm staying up to par, parleyin' 
 While y'all hating, I'm splitting this cigar 
 Man, it's nathan, all y'all do is aim and start spraying 
 'Cause tonight's the night, and me and my niggaz ain't playing (keep back) 
 Y'all done did it now, another critic kicked Tical 
 Alotta niggaz mad 'cause I ain't fold like they figure, now 
 Let me put my fitted down *hwak* spit around 
 Listen when this hit the ground, y'all gon' hear the difference now 
 Here I got that miracle, sickest individual 
 Flow that's so original, see this is what they meant to do 
 It's not an act, it's all actual fact 
 The kid is back, making tracks, catch panic attacks, and fall 
 (Method Man) 
 Aww shit, ain't this about a bitch 
 I give a fuck about a bitch, I'm more about a grip 
 And I'm all that a nigga got, the more he gotta get 
 Feeling like a million dollars, buyin' million dollar shit (keep back) 
 What y'all dealing with, one shot killing it 
 Stop changing my style, when y'all stop stealing it 
 Meth is chillin' like milk top killing 
 If it ain't got no real in it, I'm probably not feeling it (keep back) 
 I'm deadin' ya kids, and burn another blizz 
 What it is, what it is, Wu-Tang is for the kids 
 So niggaz please, why y'all puffin' them trees

 Take a trip down south and put some hoes to work, you hear me 
 Dirt McGirt, you niggaz gon' respect it 
 I'm drunk and crunk so don't come in my direction 
 I'm ready to thump, and get the whole crew arrested 
 Bail 'em out, and laugh about it in Texas, yo 
 And get with Rome, down in Caki-Lac 
 And hit the spot, in the hood where the happenings at 
 Where the shootin' and the fighting's and the stabbings at 
 Where the Lincolns and the Chevys and the Cadi's at, shit 
 Them down south niggaz been loved Dirt 
 Take a shot to the head, if you been through the worse 
 Show respect to your niggaz, who been doin' it first 
 And be comin' with that shit, I'm just doin' the worse

 Even if you tried your best, yo, I can spit)

 Yeah, damn, I'm just like Dirt in the booth 
 I'm the truth, I don't need to go to church in a suit 
 Each verse is the proof, I drink a 100 Proof 
 Cop searching the coup, I got some herb in my boot 
 When Wu is coming through, the outcome: critical 
 Fucking with this style, the outcome: get physical 
 Meth get lyrical, and y'all can get my genitals 
 Don't forget them aid essentials, vitamins and minerals 
 Heh, ya'meen, I'm taking one for the team 
 Like Martin Luther King, taking one for a dream 
 I'm dope, to many fiends, live by many means 
 If you don't stand for nothing, you'll fall for anything 
 That's real shit, let's get this money real quick 
 Dirt Dog, I'm feeling this, but I'd rather feel rich 
 I mean filthy rich, I'm corporate now

 Slide dick to your wifey 
 Never know your baby boy just might be 
 Quick to rob a jack, he's so icey, stay dressed to kill 
 From the Hill, never ran, never will 
 Attitude, like, fuck you still, I see you missing the point 
 This is not a rap song, you get clapped on 
 Bullets break the bone, like the joint, call you out your name 
 Disrespect ya moms, spit on your dame 
 Go public, then, shit on your fame, you overlooking the fact 
 Where you from, is where we at 
 And y'all don't want no, parts, in that that 
 Caught your verse for sale, but real niggaz don't shoot and tell 
 We'd rather do the time and rot in the cell

 Black jeans, black Timbs, black Benz roaster 
 Smoke rise, out the sun roof when I roll up 
 Verrazano, with no relation to Gravano 
 Carlo, shots are hollow, still cop a bottle 
 And pour some out, moment of silence, then I swallow 
 I'm still alive, and still the sun'll come out tomorrow 
 Shine shine shine, and grind, 'cause it's money on my mind 
 And I'm moving like my life is on the line 
 For the bullshit, I really got no time, a full clip 
 Really gon' let ya niggaz know what's on my mind 
 When ya getting out of line, have them choppers lit up

 Was he stalking, calling making threats where you rest 
 Until you got that order of protect

 Relax with the Meth, take a load off your breast 
 If you had a choice, baby, who would you choose 
 Them dudes who look like they got sugar in they shoes 
 Girl, that's how you lose

 This is just a few of them things that I (""got to have"") hell yeah

 Yeah yeah (Yo) 
 (Method Man) 
 Damn, I hate it when it rain 
 Ever since I came in the game 
 Some hated on the fame 
 A lot of niggas done changed 
 And started actin' strange 
 Even labels turning they backs 
 And started backing lames 
 Radio is the same, whole lotta speculatin' 
 These mutherfuckas defacatin' on the name 
 Wu-Tang, if this is where the hip-hop is 
 Radio lyin' then, that ain't where hip-hop live 
 It lives in the streets, we eat to live they livin' to eat 
 I'm fed up, that nigga rides in 'em, givin' 'em sleep 
 R.I.P., make me the king of all I see 
 And when death call I'm good I got call ID 
 See it was planned in the front, now they just gon' front 
 Like my joints is on proactive, and they just don't bump 
 Then niggas gon' say I lost my skill 
 When in fact they all been programmed 
 And lost they feel, fo' real 
 Chorus: [Lauryn](Method Man] 
 They've got so much things to say right now 
 They've got so much things to say 
 They've got so much things to say right now (Yeah) 
 They got so much things to say (Yo)

 Damn, another artist chokes again 
 They ain't cut as close as him or even broke the skin 
 See how niggas ain't yo friends, when there ain't no ends 
 Don't care who the case offend, don't underrate my pen 
 I got what it takes to win, while y'all are thinking I'm trash 
 Loving the taste of success and this drink in my glass 
 Watch 'em cosign that whack shit, give it a pass till it's gone 
 Quicker than Red, can't get rid of them clubs 
 When they're wrong, call the cops, they credibility's shot 
 It's time to learn, what hot really is and really is not 
 Off brain niggas, Meth gonna let 'em know off top 
 Don't get smacked on dvds, trying to show off blocks 
 I can't stop cause my enemies plot, or cause the cops want me 
 Shackled and locked inside the penalty box 
 And while they waitin' for my shit to flop 
 They gettin' pimped like hoes 
 Sellin' they ass just to get my spot, come on man 
 (Method Man) 
 Ask Miss Hill, half these critics ain't got half this skill 
 Often so hungry that they have to steal 
 If I didn't have my deal, and didn't have this mass appeal 
 Then I'm back up in that trap, swingin' crack it's real 
 And that ain't worth the time, so search and find a new nerve 
 And here's three words: stop working mine 
 It take a lot more to hurt my pride 
 Jerk my vibe more than media lies, cry when dirt dog die nigga 
 The last album wasn't feeling my style 
 This time my foot up in they ass but they feelin' me now 
 Cause Tical, he put his heart in every track he do 
 But somehow y'all find someway to give a whack review 
 It ain't all good, they writin' that I'm Hollywood 
 Tryin' to tell you my shit ain't ghetto and they hardly hood 
 Come on man, until you dudes can write some rhymes 
 Keep that in mind when you find yourself reciting mines"

 How should I get it started, fuck it, just get it started 
 These trash talking artists is nothing, niggaz is garbage 
 When Meth strike his target, leave it dearly departed 
 His flow is clearly the hardest, y'all gon' feel me regardless 
 Might break a promise, but never, breaking the code 
 Some get popped and call for they mamma, when the drama unfolds 
 My block, hot as a sauna, never wind up and joke 
 Crack deals on every corner, fiends wanna foam you with soap 
 And, if life's a bitch, then I bet she bitter and cold 
 Everytime she thinking I fold, seven figures get sold 
 Meth, all in your chest, or inhale it all in your nose 
 Cops don't know about this Method, but smell it all in his clothes 
 Yup, I'm still intact, how real is that, I'm back

 Pay ya dues, it cost me, who acting like I'm past my prime 
 Hey Carlton Fisk, nigga, pass the nine, who wanna cross me, now? 
 And put my body in the lost and found 
 You with the business, then bust off a round 
 It's like the passions of Christ, get crucified just for having that ice 
 And the audacity for having that life, while niggaz starving and shit 
 The main reason they be robbing and shit 
 The same reason you've been targeted bitch (these niggaz must of forgot) 
 The thin line between a hoe and a trick 
 Give 'em the clip between the four and the fifth (yeah, motherfucker I'm high)

 Thinking niggaz plotting on hairs, think they not when they is 
 This is Staten Island gully, you dig? It's getting ugly 
 And I ain't found a court that can judge me, the block love me 
 Like nines to the side of the skully, popping they top 
 I'd rather pop bubbly, one for B.I.G. and one for Pac 
 Nigga, trust me, I'm hot as they get, like Al Green 
 Getting hit by a pot of them grits, yo, nahmeen? 
 Y'all don't really want no parts of this, soon as a nigga 
 Start shining, niggaz start some shit, my guard lit 
 Like a boss, head nigga in charge, get in these drawers

 Keep a dirty cop close, never talk with no feds 
 Tear the roof off the mother, right along with ya head 
 And I ain't talk unless she talking bout bread 
 You would swear that I'm rocking New Balance, how I'm walking the ledge

 Patient, it's gonna take more than the meds

 Rip the rest of the slugs through your chest

 Punk, you pussy like the opposite sex 
 Front, see how many shots you will get 
 I'm not asking, I'm demanding respect 
 I'm just a man to respect 
 Watch your step, son, your funeral's next 
 Streetlife is the man in the flesh, I got one hand on your neck 
 The other hand is attached to the tech

 Getting weeded, one Bentley tour bus, you might like the mack and explore dust 
 You can't fuck with all of us, one of us dropped, there's twenty more of us

 Peel caps like tangerines, you shook/shake like tamberines

 Niggaz saw her, because they thought they saw a genie 
 Heidi Klum, pussy juicy, fat as a plum 
 Picture on the wall in jail, niggaz jerk till they come 
 God gargantuan, large, colossus, bombardment of darts 
 Make your squad, throw tantrums 
 Practice karma sutra on broads, pop bra's 
 Leave birds with permanent scars, and shit like birthmarks 
 Digi bark back at dogs, snatch flies from frogs 
 Blow California chronic to despise the smog

 Every little boy wanna pick up the mic 
 And try to run with the big boys and live up to the real hype 
 But that's like pickin' up a ball, playin' with mike 
 Swingin' at ken griffey or challengin roy to a fight 
 Snappin, you ameteur MC's 
 Don't you know I'm like the dream team tourin overseas 
 For rappers in my circle I'm a deadly disease 
 Ringmaster, bringin' a tiger cub to his knees (uh) 
 In the history of rap they've never seen such prominence 
 Your naive confidence gets crushed by my dominance (word up) 
 Now let's get back to this mic on my arm 
 If it ever left my side it'd transform into a time bomb 
 You don't wanna borrow that, you wanna idolize 
 And you don't wanna make me mad nigga you wanna socalize 
 And I'm daring every MC in the game 
 To play yourself out position, and mention my name 
 I make a rhyme for every syllable in your name 
 Go platinum for every time your grimy ass was on the train 
 Watch your mouth don't ever step out of line 
 Ll cool j nigga, greatest of all time"
70,Method Man,hiphop,A Lil Bit,"(Feat. Melanie Rutherford) 
 (Chorus: Melanie Rutherford) 
 If you like it (a lil' bit) I will give you a (a lil' bit) 
 If you want it (a lil' bit) you can have some more 
 Now that you spent it (a lil' bit) you can taste it a (a lil' bit) 
 If you like it (a lil' bit) you can have some more 
 (Method Man) 
 Somebody tell honey I'm good, just like a licorice 
 Meth got 'em stuck in the hood just like a clitoris 
 Something like this track from Roc', y'all, ridiculous 
 Don't touch her if I'm getting my rocks off, she ticklish 
 Now if I turn it up, shorty if you got a Dutch then we can burn it up 
 I ain't the type that need to drink to get his courage up 
 Half y'all get a drink and think you murderers 
 (Redman) 
 Yo, I know you heard of us, Red and Meth, here take a photo 
 Walk in serious like Miguel Coto 
 Pimp in my mojo, swing in my logo 
 Def Squad, Wu-Tang, that's how I do things 
 Hit my blunt, baby I see your pussy a lil' bit 
 That's when I know it's on, it's time to head home 
 And we kick bitches out, around six in the morning 
 (Method Man) 
 O.G. bubblegum, kush burn a bush 
 See you pussies like to eat out, need to learn to cook 
 Look, Meth wasn't eating 'em till I learned to juks 
 Tried to catch something, every time I work a hook 
 Now if I crank it up, if I put it in the cup would you drink it up 
 Ever get caught up in a lie and try to change it up 
 You got a pocket full of lime, try and blaze it up 
 (Redman) 
 When I bust, I sip on that sir, fly to Miami and act up a lil' bit 
 I know eyes on me, when I count to three 
 Make believe you was indeed a copied MC 
 You can smell me a lil' bit, boy, my connect just mailed me a lil' bit 
 I got that block out of drought, now everybody love me 
 It's like Beetlejuice, shit gon' get ugly 
 (Method Man) 
 I got to be out, at the club door with the key out 
 Bouncer at the door trynna tell me put the weed out 
 Honey got her feet out, the dudes coked up looking skied out 
 Tapped her on the shoulder like let's be out 
 Now should I speed it up, you know whisper in her ear, skeet skeet it up 
 Or should I take it to the crib and try to beat it up 
 A little candlelight and dinner when we need it up 
 (Redman) 
 Yo, another one light the dutch, it's Redman, holla bitch 
 Fuck you, that means she swallowed it 
 I do double on the turn, you must learn 
 Like K-are, the A-are, I grip it firm 
 If they brought hip hop back, sucker MC's be eating a lil' bit 
 Redman is on fire, so call him quick 
 You can reach me at 1-800 Eat-A-Dick"
71,Method Man,hiphop,A-YO,"Check it out, yo 
 I be like ""yiggy yes y'all"", Doctor on call 
 I'll rock till my name in graffiti on the wall 
 Got flow like the rappers in Great George 
 Got weed? (I got blunt) My name Jamal 
 I pause, flick the ash from my L 
 I (Pause) like Run and Jason Mizell 
 The emcee is me, host for the night 
 Papa Doc, only thing I don't choke on the mic 
 I choke a bitch out if my gwap ain't correct 
 Then with my giant hancock, I'll get the cheque 
 I love trucks but drop-tops is the best 
 From the Beemers, Benz, now Rolex - watch me 
 Haha, she like ""Red so cool"" 
 Any nigga after me, it's a deja vu 
 Doc stay in the paint like A.I. shoes 
 Just watch how a one tonner made a move, dig it! 
 Hop in my truck and roll up the window 
 A-yo, you know what you in for 
 Once we turn the corner, light up the endo 
 A-yo, a-yo, a-yo 
 Yes she with me getting low like a limbo 
 Roll with Gs and we'll show you how to get dough 
 Third degree, let it burn with my kinfolk 
 A-yo, a-yo, a-yo 
 Who these corner store rappers slinging cracks in my hall? 
 Mama's in the kitchen cooking cat, rat and dog 
 Me, I want a little something, y'all could have it all 
 I tryna walk before I crawl and move this package in my draws 
 That's why I push the pedal to the muh'fuckin' floor 
 With ten per cent method, only plug something poor 
 And still I keep it funky like four plus one more 
 Get this money like ""In God We Trust"", trust your boy 
 It's a given, living this life it was written 
 Especially for me, I'm what the recipe is missing 
 Blow my piff in the air, key the ignition 
 Then get to lane switching, plucking ashes off the clip and 
 Mammy wanna ride and play the Bonnie to my Clyde 
 If anybody try to (Kill Bill), it'll probably be the bride 
 Like all jokes aside, I'm serious with mine 
 And now I'm on this grind like Method Man in his prime 
 Yo, I got my swagger on and I feel great 
 Funk Doc be in the hood like Enfamil cases 
 I network on MySpace real late 
 Hoping my album make me another Bill Gates 
 Around my crib, look how I live 
 I'm a slob but crip niggas say I get biz 
 Anywhere I did a show women saying that I'm 
 ""So aaaaaa-ma-zing"" 
 Yeah, another mic, another night and the day's end 
 Another heist, another kite in the state pen 
 My state business shit, y'all dudes just break wind 
 New York nigga, either you're made mice or made men 
 I do the dirt that keep my hand on the work 
 I got the other hand up Mona Lisa's skirt 
 My aim one since day one stop 
 How many shots will it take to make son drop?

 Never been the player hater I just seem playing with you 
 You watching lame but look I'm takin' the charge 
 Getting hard and get you two shots now I'm passing the charge 
 Huh, five delight us gonna take a ride 
 They might catch you by surprise if you had a slide it 
 But if you're built for this, then you might survive 
 Guess I'll see you when you wake up on the other side 
 Yeah five delight us gonna take a ride

 Feel like a free a hundred million haters and I'm 
 Twisted up life is a blood and the world is my ash 
 For I got the quarters in them ass 'cause meet me I avoid 
 And I need a hundred percent of my profit theywith half pay 
 They takin' no shorts our losses between 
 As I can reckon it, plan and got this dope the stress 
 Turn off thework these corners like behind PS 
 Urn away the patience and I ? just say find me yet

 Yeah five delight us gonna take a ride 
 They might catch you by surprise if you had a slide it 
 But if you built for this, then you might survive 
 Guess I'll see you when you wake up on the other side 
 Face the world's worse quick the snatchin' man purse 
 And lead your body head first in the stretch hearse 
 Murder she wrote I'm on the speed the killer verse 
 And leave the play a bluss spilling on this lena shirt 
 You can co-goo my name and you ain't' gotta search 
 I'm right here in the street some putting in work 
 Go ahead, go round make get your feelings hurt 
 And you can get carried out at your local church 
 I'm from the old school, I do my own turn 
 Mama raise no fools and did my homework 
 Keep your wifey close she's a little flirt 
 I knew her since 03 I hit first 
 I'm the reason why your baby mama were the burst 
 I've been marvelous at birth you connects my earth 
 It's not a problem they show you how to shawty work 
 I out your body in the durable with the dollars worth 
 Huh, five delight us gonna take a ride 
 They might catch you by surprise if you had a slide it 
 But if you're built for this, then you might survive 
 Guess I'll see you when you wake up on the other side 
 Yeah five delight us gonna take a ride 
 They might catch you by surprise if you had a slide it

 Five minutes alone I'm already on the bone 
 Plus I love the fact you got a mind of your own 
 No need to shop around you got the good stuff at home 
 Even if I'm locked up North you in the world 
 Wrapped in three-fourths of cloth never showin your stuff off, boo 
 It be true me for you that's how it is 
 I be your Noah, you be my Wiz 
 I'm your Mister, you my Mrs. with hugs and kisses 
 Valentine cards and birthday wishes? Please 
 Be on another level of planning, of understanding 
 The bond between man and woman, and child 
 The highest elevation, 'cause we above 
 All that romance crap, just show your love 
 Like sweet morning dew 
 I took one look at you 
 And it was plain to see 
 You were my destiny 
 With you I'll spend my time 
 I'll dedicate my life 
 I'll sacrifice for you 
 Dedicate my life for you"
87,Method Man,hiphop,Intoxicated,"(Chorus: Macy Gray) 
 Intoxicated and I'm faded, by your honey 
 Why, we finally made it, got to lovin' 
 Money, seeds and shine 
 They want to hate it, try to break it 
 But it's yours and mine 
 Nothing can change it, finally made it, so divine 
 (Raekwon) 
 Yo, I sat around the illest villains 
 Campaignin' while we all G off 
 Automatic mayors, now we ain't playin' 
 Wolves start scheemin', violate me in the rain 
 Get more respect, rob Marvin Gaye on 'em 
 Gold, black, beige on 'em, heavy gauge 
 Gettin' blazed, all that money, but he ain't even shaved 
 This a new flavor, bigger vets, bigger begets 
 Bigger papes, god damn it, nigga got saved 
 Three or more, two thousand four Blazers 
 Lookin' good, it's all hood, just analyze amazed 
 Peace, let's mozy and swaze', y'all 
 Then count real bank and thank 'em, hit me on the page, what 
 (Method Man) 
 Yo, I was born on the same day as Dr. Seuss 
 Plenty of friends, henny and gin, who got the juice? 
 Let's get drunk, in this motherfucker, let's get pumped 
 I need that funk, like I ain't took a bath in a month 
 You can find me where the thugs be at, club be at 
 A fact, I love women, 'cause they love me back 
 The name's Johnny, they used to call me sucker for love 
 But now I'm grimey, cops searchin' motherfuckers for drugs 
 Give me that buzz, that calm a nigga, dimes and doves 
 At four twenty, when niggaz knew what time it was 
 A shot of Remy, in my system, I'm buzzed 
 Then baby, I ain't just a little war from unplugged 
 Haha, you know I, crack myself up, sometimes with no excuses 
 Like every nigga that done time, I didn't do it 
 Meth the Magnificent, not Jeff 
 I see the game done gone imputent, soft and suspect 
 (Ol' Dirty Bastard) 
 Yo, silence on Smith with six shots, lick shots 
 Leave ya head like a Shaolin monk with six dots 
 Hit a gush, twistin' a sweet switcher 
 In search for Bobby the Digital, bitch, not Bobby Fisher 
 Head full, with a Grey Goose and Redbull 
 I came for, a beer, weed, plus a bed full 
 Of dimepiece, model type bitches, who mind they business 
 Blow my dick, like birthday cake wishes 
 My warrior's scornful, hard to respond to 
 Dirt McGirt, be sailin' boat and in Honolulu 
 Brooklyn Zu, wild like Chaka Zulu 
 Brooklyn Zu, shots will go right through you 
 Touch me in Cali, or the streets of Mauwi 
 In the two thousand six pitch black Audi 
 Drivin' by bitches, I'm like howdy 
 Doody, to you some beauty bitches crowd me"

 You the same dime piece that I saw last week 
 On the dancefloor, yo, the way you bligh 
 Make a club of thugs do the Electric Slide 
 Pretty in pink, come here, let me buy you a drink 
 Armaretta sour orders put us both in sync' 
 My name is Bobby and I don't usually dance that much 
 I play the wall, but girl, you got that magic touch 
 That lured me in like a fly into the spider's web 
 Not these everyday hoes sweatin ghetto celebs 
 Powerule, I heard you got the good Power-you 
 Let's slip to my crib for an hour or two

 Uh, uh, uh, uh...

 Hey Butter Pecan what's that lingo you speakin'? 
 It sound like, let's me and you slide for the weekend (True) 
 I got drinks and tasty treats to sink your teeth in 
 Your popi two-way beefin, let him know that you cheatin' 
 Runnin' 'round indecent exposed without no clothes 
 There it go (*plug*), Moby Dick and there she blows 
 You got me covered, girl, and it shows and I suppose 
 We can play doctor soon as I drop out ya bows 
 (Killa Sin) 
 I don't want to dance baby girl, it's like my legs is on strike 
 Boogie that ass to the bar, snatch a Remi, no ice 
 I'm in the corner, we can vibe all night 
 Polite, I need a bag of that grass 
 To blast me out of sight like a satellite 
 Bigga what up? Yo, long time, good to see you 
 Look at shorty ass shakin like the system in my vehicle 
 Clubbin, 20 deep, buggin, all types of funny freaks 
 Mouths wide shut, we let our love for the money speak 
 (Beretta 9) 
 Yo 
 Open season, open fire, Beretta barbed wire 
 First platoon strike soon, scud-missile on the whistle 
 Up in the club with the pistol 
 This chick bumped into me like, ""You Dig', you ain't official"" 
 Indeed, so? Blow out your back, yo 
 She was like, ""Yo, nigro, nigro"" 
 Puffin all that trash, you best to see so (so so) 
 So I introduced her nightcap, she was like, ""I like that"" 
 Later on tonight, you know, I gotta spit that 
 Flow and a half, blow at her back 
 I like it rough, and I hope she's rough back 
 She was like say her name 
 I was like, ""Say mine back"" 
 She was like, ""Yo, daddy, daddy, daddy"" 
 I love it like that, Beretta stay givin' it

 When Richie Cunningham was O.P. I was low-key 
 Airing niggaz that was more square than my gold teeth 
 My appetite for destruction is to hustle 
 All the cottonmouth'll turnbuckle when I rustle 
 Mr. Tough Guy on the side, I fuck him up too 
 Slam him, when I bark I marked his Buchanan

 I tell lies under oath if it please the court

 Yo, yo, gimme some room, I'm throwin' elbows 
 Timberland boots, Air Force and shell-toes, who the fuck is them 
 If I gotta pay to get in the club 
 I'ma go pop the trunk and turn the street volume up to ten 
 I ain't on the guest list, I ain't V.I.P. 
 I snuck in the exit, learned to D-I-P 
 My dress code is all black when I'm makin' the moves 
 Similar to the new PlayStation 2 
 I can't help it if the club only packin' a G 
 And the fire marshal wanna shut it down in 3 
 And you ballin' ass niggaz whose dressed to kill 
 For the hoes showin' the toes with extra heels 
 I gotta get in, I drove here 
 With a carload of bitches charged on Belvedere 
 My niggaz hit the cells if the line is thick 
 So I drive the 500 through the door of the bitch

 We gonna bum rush The Tunnel with a pound of weed 
 Cut the light on, you see it's Brick City in here 
 Blazin' like Biggie passed us a semi in here 
 Don't sleep, stay wide awoke 
 You dialed Doc, not dial-a-joke 
 Crawl or you'll die in smoke 
 I keep it heated when the hawk is out 
 Seated low Tahoe, beat it when the dark is out 
 I'm outside of the line and I'm actin' a fool 
 Like a three o'clock bully, waitin' after school 
 Punks, I've been in this line for hours 
 I even killed the time by helpin' my man pass out fliers 
 Now all I wanna do is get in where I fit in 
 Shake my ass with the baddest pigeon with her wig in 
 Jump, move, crash, drink 
 Shake that ass stank, the fuck you think? 
 Poppa Bear at the table and the porridge is pourin' 
 Since Def is the label, I belong in a morgue 
 I'm walkin' half-dead, actin' senile 
 With bigga niggaz from jail than the one on ""Green Mile""

 You walked away and I missed you 
 Visions of wanting to kiss you 
 How could this be if I don't really know you? 
 Oh baby, baby 
 Could it be love at first sight? 
 And I never knew that I, could fall in love on the very first night 
 Could this be love? 
 You had on the latest fashion 
 It was a bigger distraction 
 It drew me closer and closer to you, yeah, baby 
 I never saw anything like this 
 But you I just could not resist 
 I swallowed my pride and stepped through your side 
 Or could it be - be 
 Could it be love at first sight? 
 And I never knew that I, could fall in love on the very first night 
 Could this be love? 
 I wanna know if you could call me up (could you call me up sometime? please) 
 And maybe somebody we just might hook up, could this love at first sight? 
 Once again, it's that other M&M now 
 How many women feelin' him? 
 Somebody call the coroner, quick, Mary is killin' 'em 
 Tell 'em what's the 411 and who came runnin' 
 When Clef dialed 911 from shots comin' 
 This somethin' for the radio, guest starring M.C. 
 Johnny Blazin' the hip hop and R&B 
 What, y'all thought ya wasn't gon' see me 
 You can't spell Mary J. Blige without a J.B. 
 Well back to the matter, and it's sex on the platter 
 She only wanna be happy and I ain't mad at her 
 You go momma, nowadays, I'm more calmer 
 And if you take a look at my life, no more drama 
 Now you know, you searchin' for a Wu-Tang pro 
 You find me, just bout everywhere the poontang go 
 Now you know, feel me like your favorite love song 
 'Cause my computer love is the thetruth.com 
 Could it be love at first sight?

 Could this be love?

 We move up, the buck stops here 
 No more dough will be made 
 Unless it's being made by hoes 
 What's that rhythm, what's that sound? 
 Party people gettin' down 
 When it hit the baddest man 
 Just release yo' delf 
 Keep it movin', baby, we be movin', uh 
 And keep it movin', you know we keep it movin', uh 
 And keep it movin', baby, we be movin', uh 
 And keep it movin', you know we keep it move 
 And keep it movin', baby, we be movin', uh 
 And keep it movin', you know we keep it movin', uh 
 And keep it movin', baby, we be movin', uh 
 And keep it movin', you know we keep it move

 Yeah yeah 
 All the game that you was spittin' 
 Did you know that you was trippin' 
 Never thought to see me dippin 
 But I had to get missin' 
 I'm tired of you stressin me 
 Why don't you let it be 
 Comin' round testin me 
 Fuckin' with me mentally 
 Good bye 
 Don't wanna see your face no more 
 So long 
 Pack your bags want you out the door 
 Cause every time I play this ball game 
 Time and time again it's gonna rain 
 It's gonna rain 
 It's gonna rain 
 It's gonna rain 
 [Method Man]: 
 Oh shit there you go again 
 Flippin on me 
 One minute we the shit 
 The next minute you shittin on me 
 So what's the problem huh 
 No way let me guess 
 You need some space 
 And some place to get a load off your chest 
 No better yet 
 You don't get enough attention at home 
 And when I'm gone 
 I don't even think to pick up the phone 
 I'm dead wrong 
 Now you're fed up 
 Packin my stuff fuckin' my head up 
 And I see it in your face right now you'd wish I'd shut up 
 [Chorus--Jonell]: 
 Really don't know what you came here for 
 Round and around we go 
 Setting your bags outside the door 
 Round and around we go 
 Repeat 
 [Jonell]: 
 If you don't understand where I'm comin' from 
 Then my heart is tellin' me you're not the one 
 All the games you played and all the lies 
 You're not the one for me no more so baby bye bye 
 Pack your bags and get to steppin 
 You gotta let it go you need to stop trippin' 
 (I hope you don't think I'm a let you back it) 
 'Cause you's a fool 
 [Jonell]: 
 Don't waist your time 
 You fooled me once but not a second time 
 Now it's time for you to go away 
 I packed your things nothin' else for us to say 
 Bye 
 [Method Man]: 
 I was gutter when you met me 
 Gutter when ya left me 
 Gutter when you came back 
 Face that nothin' can change that 
 Not romance or marriage counselin 
 You dropped the ball now I'm bouncin' 
 Buy me a room burn up an ouncin 
 Waiting for my baby to call 
 Forgivin all 
 A lesson break up 
 To make up 
 Shit givin' me drawers 
 Now adore me amor 
 But every time she choose to go to war 
 I'm lookin' at the front door 
 [Jonell]: 
 Today I made up my mind 
 To get away 
 Everyday 
 I sit and pray 
 Everyday 
 Everyday 
 Today I made up my mind 
 To get away 
 Everyday 
 I sit and pray

 Yo, set it off, set it off, yo, yo, yo

 While John Cochran break your pride in 
 I shagged her before you married her 
 Took the ring, pawned it for an Acura 
 DOC, breakin' the sound barrier 
 Hardcore bullet, fo'-fo' pull it 
 Got your camp runnin', used it for footage 
 Brick City suspects couldn't [unverified] 
 Yo, watch me leap through trees 
 Attackin' sharks in the Deep Blue Sea 
 Aim lock on, Goldeneye 
 War in the snow storm, with double, oh on

 PPP niggaz be jackin' cabbage 
 Looked in the camera and pull the mask up 
 Laughin' at ya, yeah I x'd you out 
 Somebody help him out with mouth to mouth 
 You to me son, what you talkin' 'bout? 
 If your third eye look then I gorge it out 
 Bitches fuck me barely walkin' out 
 For a thievin' ass hoe fo' mark it out 
 It's one mo' body in the hall for now 
 Verbal assault killer, calm him down 
 I open fire, made you retire 
 Hung your shoes from a telephone wire 
 So when I ride by, I brag on it 
 Paragraphs fly wit toe tags on it 
 I plant a bomb where you pick your mail up 
 It's bricks, so y'all hit the fallout shelter

98,Method Man,hiphop,Smooth Sailing Remix,"Yo, behind those mahogany walls 
 Indoor pools with steel doors, flipping eggs over in my silk drawers 
 While I""m charging my cell, sparking the L 
 Baby mother reading my mail, just that they switched seats 
 To another jail, and his banger is old fire 
 He's locked up with them dudes from the fucking Wire 
 That's when I passed her the bone, started to cough 
 And flossed all through the house, robe on, rugger out 
 Homebuyers see the sign, yeah y'all, I'm moving out 
 In front of the crib, niggas flipped, I had to shoot it out 
 Thirty G, living room sets, porcelain plates 
 With big giant wall units, even the front grass 
 Saw your boy doing it, Tone Stark he'll never fall 
 I even put work in, under the floor 
 In the box with the ox, and my skeleton jaw 
 Tell 'em soldiers I'm in the bush if the President call 
 Get 'em, the'll be nothing but smooth sailing 
 When the heat shot, now your crew's bailing 
 I refuse to bow down, refuse to lay down 
 Go five and turn, to let the biz, all I found 
 Man I thought we told y'all niggas before, Wu-Tang is for the children 
 P.O.'s violate your dirty urine 
 These dealers in the lobby of my building, ice grilling 
 I don't catch cold to catch feelings 
 I put in that work, then catch millions 
 If that don't work, back to stealing 
 Snatch me a purse, and stack real in 
 Meth, I'm that dealing, millionaire, slash chameleon 
 I mastered the juks, one of my niggas ""Masta, killing"" 
 Spray shots, clap civilians at the dealing table 
 Off of the love of crack dealing 
 Once again the fatal, flying guillotine, the millions 
 Paper rob me able, my woman is all pre-matul 
 I got mouths to feed, nigga, and I'm the hand that rocks the cradle 
 Just like Hova, but I ain't trying to 'roc' the label 
 I'm a soldier, I stay on job, me, eye a coka 
 Honey's wanna fuck and the industry fucks 'em over 
 I got my Ghostface on, cause, I'm a Killah 
 I live the Streetlife, why, I'm that nigga 
 Label me a beast, call me U-Godzilla 
 When I rumble in the jungle, I go gorilla 
 Step on the set, Inspectah Deck you 
 Dead in your face, straight RZArect you 
 You highly mistaken, I'm hotter than Satan 
 Catch me in the kitchen with blood on Chef apron 
 I'm known to, Cap a Don, big gun in my palm 
 I'm like my arm is gone, plus I Masta the Kill 
 Give you something, you can really feel 
 Got many Methods to kill a Man, if it's real, you real 
 The world's worse like Dirt McGirt 
 Fuck a bitch raw dog, then dig in her purse 
 Yeah that boy's a Genius, I stay fresh like I'm straight out the cleaners 
 I walk hard like a criminal, holding my penis"
99,Method Man,hiphop,Stella,"Stay dip, cute bitch out in Delaware, moving our bricks 
 So hard, stupid big stones from Miss Stella ear 
 She just turn 35, we in the spot on Martin Luther King Drive 
 Whole team getting high, on phones 
 We learned different codes of pig Latin 
 So the jakes don't follow our trail with sick patterns 
 And the crib is jig, Jennifer convertible love seat 
 That's worth forty G's from Madrid 
 In Spain, sipping cherry Cosmo's and things 
 Stella, finish the glass, showing niggas her rings 
 I said bitch, I ain't impressed with that 
 Why the fuck is every briefcase short by at least ten stacks 
 We had a mil' in each bag, there's eighty grand missing 
 You pop up with a new Jag', with a bad system 
 I done sent your ass to Hawaii and Waikiki 
 When your man needed bail, you'll come see me 
 Rob me? That's how we do? You pretty slick muthafucka 
 You must think I'm a sucker 
 Matter fact, you gon' suck this dick, how bout that for a change 
 Let me see what's really on your brain 
 She said 'Starkey, you violating me, stop it' 
 I saved up for this shit, you playing me like a hostage 
 Out of all people, I wheeled you around, when you got shot 
 Be the closest one too you, and may I rot 
 In hell, yo Starks, chill, I don't think she that stupid 
 Since '90, '95, she came through, kid 
 Two million in six weeks, cover six space 
 Just to think of those towns alone, we brought a big steak 
 But it still don't change the job 
 Aiyo, Tone, who this silly bitch trynna rob 
 Niggas been getting money, since pushing a Saab 
 In the spot writing rhymes, never heard of a blog 
 Is it that coincidental? That the same rental 
 Be out in Virginia and DC, before she come see me 
 I'm ready, put this hammer in her face in 3D 
 I know that's your home girl, but fuck it, on GP 
 And I don't like her brother, either, he probably put her up to it 
 Give me the word and I go empty his fluid 
 Shady? I been bagging up since 1980 
 Me and Ghost been tight, since Fred met Grady, lady 
 So what you telling me? My account is off? 
 Oh you must really muthafucking think we that damn soft 
 Hold on, yo, Sheek, what you gon' do? Cut her whole hand off? 
 Put a pillow over her face, and let the four bang off? 
 Or we can get the gat taping so the hoe can't talk 
 Before we get the whole story cut this whole thing short 
 I don't think that's wise at all, whatever honey do with her money, dog 
 That's not my problem, why is it yours? 
 Wu-Block, you riding for mine, I'm riding for yours 
 That's the motto if you talking bout homicide, my lordyep 
 It's survival, homey, you ain't never lied, my lord 
 But the Pretty Toney baby ain't never lied before 
 That's a hundred lucci, word to Bully, I smoke too many loosies 
 I know her history, if something fishy, must be the coochie 
 It ain't no mystery, your finger itchy, if she a groupie 
 Once you go up, once you go down, let's keep it Gucci 
 You take her head, I take all the jewellery from all these moolies 
 Get all your goonies, and we can meet up for Call of Duty 
 Ain't nothing funny like Paul Mooney, this fatal beauty 
 Got some explaining to do, hold up, I thought you knew me 
 Better than that, we know the cheddar was tapped 
 You getting bread in the trap, why get in bed with them rats 
 My son is missing some racks, and Louch is fitting to snap 
 She need to come up with answers, instead of fixing her Mac 
 Makeup, just give the facts, straight up, and just the facts 
 If you did it, we gon' bury you with it, and that's that"

 I want the chrome and the cream so I put it down for mine 
 Ill cat, slick talk, slang new york 
 To break it down to straight English, what the fuck you want? 
 Remember me? you punk fagot crab emcee 
 Get your shit broke in half for fucking around with p 
 Hey yo strike two, my style Brooklyn like the zoo 
 Hey you, look nigga, one more strike you through 
 Word is bi-dond, rock esco, fubu, and phat fi-darm 
 Every time I get my spit on, no doubt, I spark the gridiron 
 I step up and bless the track and spit a jewel 
 We keeps cool, no need for static, I strap tools 
 Next up! 
 Yo I believe that's me 
 Yo, get on the mic and rock the symphony 
 (Erick Sermon) 
 Yo p! 
 Time to rock, the sound I got, it reigns hot 
 Making necks snap back, like a slingshot 
 E hustle, and muscle my way in 
 Then tussle for days in, on my own with guns blazing 
 Not for the fun of it, just for those who want me to run it 
 Then leave them like, who done it? 
 Sucker duck, I do what I feel right now 
 When I spit the illest shit, cats be like, ""wow!"" 
 Yo! I get looks when I'm in the place 
 That's that nigga, making you +smile+ with Scarface 
 It ain't my fault, that my style silk enough to shock ya 
 Hit you with the fifth, block-a block-a 
 If I get caught you can bet I'll blow trial 
 Be downtown swinging, m.o.p. style 
 Next up!

 Yo, you're on the mic to rock the symphony

 Yo yo 
 Did you ever think you would catch a cap? 
 Yo did you ever think you would get a slap? 
 Yo did you ever think you would get robbed 
 At gunpoint, stripped and thrown out the car? 
 It's funk doc, you know my name hoe 
 My style dirty underground, or Ukraine po' 
 When it hits you, pain pumps cool-aid, through the vein and shit 
 Snatch the trap then I dash like Damon did 
 Doc, walk thin red lines to shell shock 
 Hair lock with fucking broads in nail shops 
 Hydro? got more bags than bellhops 
 Two thousand Benz on my eight by ten picture 
 Papichu', slaying gcrews in icu 
 Battling, using hockey rules 
 For Keith Murray, doc gon' cock these tools 
 Rollin' down like dice in Yahtzee fool! 
 I ""just do it"" like Nike, outta 'bama 
 With ten kids with hammers, hooked to a camper! 
 Yo next up 
 It's the g-o-d 
 Yo yo, get on the mic for the symphony 
 (Method) 
 Youth on the move, paying them dues, nothing to lose 
 Huh, street kids, broken and bruised, eyeing yo' jewels 
 Huh, bad news, baring they souls through rhyming blues 
 Hardcore! to make them brothers act fool 
 Hands on the steel, flip you heads over heel 
 Smell the daffodils from the lyric overkill 
 Feeling like the mack inside a Cadillac Seville 
 Too ill, on cuts, the barber of Seville, fi-ga-ro! 
 The sky is falling, Geronimo! 
 I feel my high coming down, lookout below! 
 Hey yo! dead that roach clip and spark another 
 Chicken hawks, playing they selves like Parker brothers 
 I rock for the low-class, from locash 
 The broke-assed, even rock for trailer park trash 
 Yeah yeah, the god on your block like Godzilla 
 Yeah yeah, she gave away my pussy I'ma kill her 
 John john phenom-enon, in Japan they call me ichiban 
 Wu-tang clan, number won! 
 In the whole nine, I hold mine 
 Keep playing with it kid, you might go blind, jerk off! 
 Fuck them a.k.a., for now it's just meth 
 That's it, that's all, solo, single no more no less 
 Next up! 
 I believe that's me 
 Bastard! 
 Get on the mic and rock the symphony 
 (Lady Luck) 
 Mrs. stop drop and roll, rocks top the told 
 Hot, even though dames is froze 
 Pop close range at foes, and blaze them hoes 
 Leave 'em with they brains exposed, and stains on clothes 
 Y'all better change your flows, hear how luck spitting? 
 Stay drunk-pissed in the s-type, stay whipping 
 When the guns spitting, duck or get hitting 
 It's written, we in the game but ball different 
 Point game like Jordan, y'all play the role of Pippen 
 Style switching, like tight ass after sticking 
 Man listen, stop your crying and your bitching 
 Like e and p's last CD, you're out of business"

 Perfected, my routine's are hectic and knockin'

 Get me off, grant them the ball, if I walk 
 Put that order in the court, yeah 
 Give me crack on and who the fuck really care, yeah

 Or be gone outta here, you be warned 
 Fuck all, get off that bullshit 
 And kick the fuckin' tux off, now it's on

 The outlandish, even though they can't stand us 
 You better off gettin' pick a size, tryin' to ban us 
 Either way you put it off, I'mma be heard 
 That's my word, Stone Cold, Goldberg 
 Like a nerve, don't fuck what ya heard 
 That nigga just started hangin' out on the curb 
 What's the verdict, soundin like me, you can't word it 
 I put it in overdrive, while you short circuit 
 Worship the ground that I walk on 
 I brought on, all the real niggas that you talked on 
 Blahzay Blah, so on, it's a done deal, don't even go on 
 Soundin nauseous, to choke on strong, to get my smoke on 
 (Sic) 
 Talkin' 'bout gats, ain't no bustin' clacks, and ain't hustlin 
 Too many cats that want to rap, and ain't sayin' nothin' 
 Foolin ya self, how let ya ass do it to ya self 
 When it comes to cash, we the ones doin' it, who else? 
 Walkin' our dogs, ya cats better beat yours 
 Hot heat reach why'all, before you even get a chance to recharge 
 You weak paw, me and my street niggas a' eat why'all 
 We all, guess they ain't no question that we sure

 Reminisce on back in the days, can it be 
 It was all so simple then, we all kin 
 And black-skinned, original Don set the trend 
 Let's be men, if not for us, then for the babies 
 The little ones the revolution has now begun
