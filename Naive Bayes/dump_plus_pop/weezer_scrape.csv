 And when I lose my cool 
 I don't know what to do

 'Cause I am such a fool 
 And I don't need a single book to teach me how to read 
 Who needs stupid books? 
 They are for petty crooks 
 And I will learn by studying the lessons in my dreams 
 So turn off the TV 
 'Cause that's what others see 
 And movies are as bad as eating chocolate ice cream 
 They only sicken me 
 Don't let me play football 
 I'll sack the quarterback and jack the brother of the ball 
 I'm a troublemaker 
 Never been a faker 
 Doing things my own way and never giving up 
 I'm a troublemaker 
 Not a double-taker 
 I don't have the patience to keep it on the up 
 I picked up a guitar 
 What does it signify? 
 I'm gonna play some heavy metal wishing you will die 
 You wanted arts and crafts 
 How's this for arts and crafts? 
 Nananananananana That's right! 
 I'm growing out my hair 
 I'm moving out to Cherokee 
 I'm gonna be a rock star and you will go to bed with me 
 'Cause I can't work a job 
 Like any other slob 
 Punching in and punching out and sucking up to Bob 
 Marrying a biatch 
 Having seven kids 
 Giving up and growing old and hoping there's a God 
 I'm a troublemaker 
 Never been a faker 
 Doing things my own way and never giving up 
 I'm a troublemaker 
 Not a double-taker 
 I don't have the patience to keep it on the up 
 I'm gonna be a star 
 And people will crane necks 
 To get a glimpse of me and see if I am having sex 
 And studying my moves 
 They try to understand 
 Why I am so unlike the singers in the other bands 
 I'm such a mystery 
 As anyone can see 
 There isn't anybody else exactly quite like me 
 And when it's party time 
 Like 1999 
 I'll party by myself because I'm such a special guy 
 I'm a troublemaker 
 Never been a faker 
 Doing things my own way and never giving up 
 I'm a troublemaker 
 Not a double-taker 
 I don't have the patience to keep it on the up 
 Keep it on the up 
 I'm a troublemaker 
 Keep it on the up 
 I'm a troublemaker 
 Keep it on the up 
 I'm a troublemaker 
 Keep it on the up 
 I'm a troublemaker 
 Never giving up"

58,Weezer,rock,Heart Songs,"Gordon Lightfoot sang a song 
 About a boat that sank in the lake 
 At the break of the morning 
 A Cat named Stevens 
 Found a faith he could believe in 
 And Joan Baez, 
 I never listened to too much jazz 
 But hippie songs could be heard in our pad 
 Eddie Rabbit sang about how much he loved a rainy night 
 ABBA, Devo, Benetar were there the day John Lennon died 
 Mr. Springsteen said he had a hungry heart 
 Grover Washington was happy on the day he topped the chart 
 These are the songs 
 These are my heart songs 
 They never feel wrong 
 And when I wake for goodness sake 
 These are the songs I keep singing 
 Quiet Riot got me started with the bangin' of my head 
 Iron Maiden, Judas Priest and Slayer taught me how to shred 
 I got to admit though 
 Sometimes I would listen to the radio 
 Debbie Gibson, 
 Tell me that you think we're all alone 
 Michael Jackson's in the mirror 
 I gotta have faith if I want to see clear 
 Never gonna give you up 
 Wish me love, a wishing well 
 It takes two to make a thing go right 
 If the Fresh Prince starts a fight 
 Don't you worry for too long 
 'Cause you know 
 These are the songs 
 These are my heart songs 
 (these are my songs) 
 They never feel wrong 
 (never feel wrong) 
 And when I wake for goodness sake 
 (these are my songs) 
 These are the songs I keep singing 
 Back in 1991 
 I wasn't havin' any fun 
 Till my roommate said, 
 ""Come on"" 
 and put a brand new record on 
 Had a baby on it 
 He was naked on it 
 Then I heard the chords 
 That broke the chains I had upon me 
 Got together with my bros 
 In some rehearsal studios 
 Then we played our first rock show 
 And watched the fanbase start to grow 
 We signed the deal that gave the dough 
 To make a record of our own 
 Song come on the radio 
 Now people go, 
 ""This is the song."" 
 These are my heart songs (these are my songs) 
 They never feel wrong (never feel wrong) 
 And when I wake for goodness sake 
 These are the songs I keep singing 
 These are the songs I keep singing 
 These are the songs I keep singing 
 These are the songs I keep singing 
 These are the songs I keep singing"

 You charmed the lifeguard, he let them use the pool all day for free

 I dug you so much, I took some for the team

 I can't stop partying, partying 
 I can't stop partying, partying

 I gotta have a lot of pretty girls around me 
 Oh, I can't stop partying, partying 
 I can't stop, partying, partying 
 I gotta have the cars, I gotta have the jewels 
 And if you was me, honey, you would do it too 
 Monday to Sunday I hit all the clubs 
 And now e'rybody know me when I pull up 
 I got the real big posse with me, yeah I'm deep 
 And if you lookin' for me, I'm in VIP 
 Just follow the smoke; they're bringing bottles of the goose 
 And all the girls in the corner getting loose 
 Screw rehab I love my addiction 
 No sleep no sleep I am always on a mission 
 'Cause I can't stop partying, partying 
 I can't stop partying, partying 
 I gotta have Patron, I gotta have the beat 
 I gotta have a lot of pretty girls around me 
 Oh, I can't stop partying, partying 
 I can't stop, partying, partying 
 I gotta have the cars, I gotta have the jewels 
 And if you was me, honey, you would do it too 
 Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh... 
 Uh, party like tomorrow is my funeral 
 Gotta stop mixing alcohol with pharmaceuticals 
 And the unusual is the fucking usual 
 Man, my life is beautiful 
 And my girls are mutual 
 Okay bitches, it's Weezer and it's Weezy 
 Upside-down MTV 
 Please don't shoot me down because I'm an endangered species 
 It's the days of our lives 
 With my night just started 
 I pray the killer doesn't take the life of the party 
 I can't stop partying, partying 
 I can't stop partying, partying 
 I gotta have Patron, I gotta have the beat 
 I gotta have a lot of pretty girls around me 
 Oh, I can't stop partying, partying 
 I can't stop, partying, partying 
 I gotta have the cars, I gotta have the jewels

 Stumbling around the town 
 Lookin' for action 
 Totally wasted 
 And trying to find a date 
 I could be killed 
 I could be arrested 
 But I don't care no more 
 I just wanna find the thrill 
 That I felt once before 
 I'm losing my mind 
 I'm going insane 
 I'm watching my life go down the drain 
 Maybe I'll find the answers 
 In one of these nightclubs 
 And one of the people I meet 
 Maybe they'll tell me that everything's gonna be fine 
 And we can quit 
 The wild life we know 
 We've reached the finish line, honey 
 Now we can go home 
 I'm losing my mind 
 I'm going insane 
 I'm watching my life go down the drain 
 I'm running out of energy 
 And I have to lie down 
 Right here on the sidewalk 
 Next to the shoe town 
 I hope nobody bothers me 
 'Cause I'm so tired 
 And empty 
 Life means nothing anymore 
 I'm losing my mind 
 I'm going insane 
 I'm watching my life go down the drain 
 I'm losing my mind (I'm losing my mind) 
 I'm going insane (I'm going insane) 
 I'm watching my life go down the drain 
 I'm watching my life go down the drain"

 Ain't got nobody 
 Ain't got nobody, ain't got nobody 
 Ain't got no one to really love me 
 Ain't got nobody, ain't got nobody 
 Ain't got no one to kiss and hug me 
 I've been so patient, all around the nation 
 There ain't no one in all creation 
 I'm living all alone 
 Nobody at home 
 I try to fall asleep 
 I really start to freak 
 My daddy loved me, no one could touch me 
 Until he went up and left me lonely 
 That's human nature, we fail each other 
 We keep on searching for another 
 I thought I had a friend 
 But she was just pretend 
 She didn't have a soul 
 Nothing I could hold 
 Ain't got nobody, ain't got nobody 
 Ain't got no one to really love me 
 Someone I could greet 
 When I come home from work 
 Someone who would smile 
 And take away the hurt 
 Ain't got nobody

 Take me back, back to the shack 
 Back to the Strat with the lightning strap 
 Kick in the door, more hardcore 
 Rockin' out like it's '94 
 Let's turn up the radio 
 Turn off those stupid singing shows 
 I know where we need to go 
 Back to the shack 
 I finally settled down with my girl and I made up with my dad 
 I had to go and make a few mistakes so I could find out who I am 
 I'm letting all of these feelings out even if it means I fail 
 'Cause this is what I was meant to do and you can't put that on sale 
 Take me back, back to the shack 
 Back to the Strat with the lightning strap 
 Kick in the door, more hardcore 
 Rockin' out like it's '94 
 Let's turn up the radio 
 Turn off those stupid singing shows 
 I know where we need to go 
 Back to the shack 
 We belong in the rock world 
 There is so much left to do 
 If we die in obscurity, oh well 
 At least we raised some hell 
 Take me back, back to the shack 
 Back to the Strat with the lightning strap 
 Kick in the door, more hardcore 
 Rockin' out like it's '94 
 Let's turn up the radio 
 Turn off those stupid singing shows

 Fifteen years of ruling the planet 
 But now your light's fading 
 Adios rock band that we loved the most 
 This is a toast to what you did 
 And all that you were fighting for 
 Who could do more? 
 When time marches on 
 Words come and go 
 We will sing the melodies 
 That you did long ago 
 Women were screaming, guys were copying you 
 Cause you moved the people to sobbing, inspiring 
 You spoke for the world in your songs 
 Adios rock band that we loved the most 
 This is a toast to what you did 
 And all that you were fighting for 
 Who could do more? 
 When time marches on 
 Words come and go 
 We will sing the melodies 
 That you did long ago 
 We'll never forget the gems you made 
 Let 'em fade 
 It's time that we laid you in your grave 
 Let 'em fade 
 Goodbye 
 Adios rock band that we loved the most 
 This is a toast to what you did

 Walking to his grave plot 
 Knowing that the one he loves 
 Hates him with all of her heart 
 Forgive your foolish father

 You are his daughter 
 He'd do anything for you

 How comical this stuff that makes a man 
 Forgive your foolish father

 Albatross around their necks

 Breathe in the salt 
 Slicing waves at 40 knots 
 Cumulonimbus in the sky 
 This is what we've waited for 
 And now there's no more hyperventilating in wheelchairs 
 We're gonna save the last dog on Funk Island 
 We're had to do it wrong before we could do it right

 Scrape every quark

 Do you wanna get high? 
 Don't eat no dinner tonight 
 I took a road trip to Mexico 
 And scored a hundred count 
 Do you wanna get high? 
 It's like we're falling in love 
 We can listen to Bacharach 
 And stop at any point 
 Now our bones start to ache 
 As we cramp on the pot 
 And we fall to the floor 
 With our face in a knot

 And stop at any point 
 Keep on doing what you do 
 'Cause I'll never get tired of you 
 Don't need booze 
 'Cause I'll never get tired of you 
 Stop the tape, kill the lights, close the drapes 
 And keep doing what you do 
 'Cause I'll never get tired of you

 Got a $20 tip on New Years'

 With the boys from down the way

 I asked her if she had a girlfriend 
 She said ""Hell, I wouldn't know"" 
 Any friend of Diane's is a friend of mine

 Went down to the bank of the river 
 And she washed my dirty hands 
 I've been hanging around in a cloud of shame 
 Till she let me taste the cold water 
 Diane would help me pass out all the fliers 
 I became a big shot 
 And she got sick one day 
 I still have the map she drew for me 
 I'd be lost without it 
 That's as much I wanna say 
 Any friend of Diane's is a friend of mine

 For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn 
 Fall on your knees

 O night, O hoe 
 Oly night, o night divine 
 Truly he taught us to love one another 
 His law is love and his gospel is peace 
 Chains shall he break for the slave is our brother 
 And in his name all oppression shall cease 
 Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we 
 Let all within us praise his holy name 
 Christ is the Lord 
 Oh, praise his name forever 
 His pow'r and glory 
 Ever more proclaim 
 His pow'r and glory ever more proclaim

 And they looked up and saw a star 
 Shining in the east beyond them far 
 And to the earth it gave great light 
 And so it continued both day and night

 Born to raise the sons of earth 
 Born to give them second birth

 How can I get by? 
 With no one to try and pick me back up when I fall down 
 My support has left me and I'm bareft 
 Of the things I need to help me make it all through 
 Now what can I do, with no cheering crew 
 That you make me feel like I don't suck 
 Whoa There was a brightening day 
 (Solo) 
 Whoa there was a brightening day 
 My whole scene has split they don't give a spit 
 About anybody else on earth but themselves 
 So we'll burn in hell and think that it's swell 
 Just as long as we get our own rooms 
 So we'll burn in hell and think that it's swell 
 Just as long as we get our own rooms"

157,Weezer,rock,The Spider,"There's a spider in the drain and he's feeling pain 
 And he doesn't want to die any more than you or I 
 He's struggling to live but he doesn't have much time 
 Any more than you or I, you or I 
 We've got to die, We've got to live 
 We got to take what we can get 
 We sell ourselves for petty change 
 And when we die we rearrange 
 It's time to take it back again 
 It's time to take it back again 
 I want you to love me like I love you 
 There's nothing more for me to say 
 I spoke my piece I'll go on my way 
 And fare thee well where'er you go 
 You might need help but I won't know 
 'Cause I'm up in here in my own cell 
 It could be heaven it could be hell 
 We'll never know just who we are 
 'Cause when we die we become a star 
 And stars can't talk because they have 
 No mouth to speak about their past 
 They simply shine up in the sky 
 And give their light to you and I 
 And where would we be without their light 
 We'd call out names and then start a fight 
 But then again that's what we do 
 I hate me and I hate you too 
 'Cause I'm in pain just like the spider 
 In the drain, I am a fighter 
 But I can't win I've got to lose 
 Give me strength to see me through 
 And ease the pain that I must feel 
 As my bones break and I taste the steel 
 As I go down... the drain... 
 I'm insane"

 Take a load off, Fanny 
 Take a load for free 
 Take a load off, Fanny 
 And you put the load right on me 
 I picked up my bag, I went looking for a place to hide 
 When I saw Carmen and the Devil walking side by side 
 I said, ""Hey Carmen, come on, let's go downtown"" 
 She said, ""I gotta go but my friend can stick around"" 
 Go down Miss Moses, there's nothing you can say 
 It's just old Luke, and Luke's waiting on the judgment day 
 ""Well, Luke my friend, what about young Anna-Lee?"" 
 He said ""Do me a favor son, won't you stay and keep Anna-Lee company?"" 
 Crazy Chester followed me and he caught me in the fog 
 He said ""I will fix your rat if you'll take Jack my dog"" 
 I said ""Wait a minute Chester, you know I'm a peaceful man"" 
 He said ""That's okay boy, won't you feed him when you can?"" 
 Catch a cannonball now to take me down the line 
 My bag is sinking low and I do believe it's time 
 To get back to Miss Fanny, you know she's the only one 
 Who sent me here with her regards for everyone"

 With hundreds of friends 
 They sleep up in the trees at night 
 I have a friend and he's a dragonfly 
 He sweeps around all day and hovers in the air 
 He's colorful and wonderful 
 His wings are strong and powerful 
 He's the dragonfly

 Seas would rise when I gave the word 
 Now in the morning I sleep alone 
 Sweep the streets I used to own 
 I used to roll the dice 
 Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes 
 Listened as the crowd would sing 
 Now the old king is dead long live the king 
 One minute I held the key 
 Next the walls were closed on me 
 And I discovered that my castles stand 
 Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand 
 I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing 
 Roman cavalry choirs are singing 
 Be my mirror, my sword and shield 
 Missionaries in a foreign field 
 For some reason I can't explain 
 Once you'd gone there was never 
 Never an honest word 
 And that was when I ruled the world 
 It was a wicked and wild wind 
 Blew down the doors to let me in 
 Shattered windows and the sound of drums 
 People couldn't believe what I'd become 
 Revolutionaries wait 
 For my head on a silver plate 
 Just a puppet on a lonely string 
 Oh who would ever want to be king? 
 I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing 
 Roman cavalry choirs are singing 
 Be my mirror, my sword and shield 
 My missionaries in a foreign field 
 For some reason I can't explain 
 I know St Peter won't call my name 
 Never an honest word 
 But that was when I ruled the world 
 Hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing 
 Roman cavalry choirs are singing 
 Be my mirror, my sword and shield 
 My missionaries in a foreign field 
 For some reason I can't explain

 Whether you win or lose. 
 One hundred years from now, 
 They'll look back on this day, 
 Where are you going to be, 
 And what are they going to say, 
 I see my name in lights, 
 The people call my name, 
 It's all up to you, 
 Will you find your way? 
 It matters how you play the game, 
 It matters that you can take the pain, 
 You don't want to lie, steal, or cheat your way to the top, 
 Oh-oh-oh 
 It matters what your people think, 
 You represent your family, 
 Well that's just one more reason to see, 
 That it matters... 
 Whether you win or lose. 
 It matters what your mother thinks, 
 You represent your family, 
 Well that's just one more reason to see, 
 That it matters... 
 Whether you win or lose."

 Right on

 Yellow Camaro 
 With freedom of eagles you soar high

 Made me wait on you

 So I should be happy 
 I'm out of here

 Have yourself a nice life 
 'Cause I'm out of here 
 You are going to feel stupid some day 
 When you realize what you threw away 
 No one else can make you feel like I do 
 Have a nice life without me, you fool!

183,Weezer,rock,Everybody Needs Salvation,"Meet me in the dark 
 My heart shrivels when the light is shining 
 I can't get back home alone 
 I need someone here to guide me 
 Praise for the awakened one 
 He truly saved my life 
 But after all his truth is small 
 And I love the lie 
 Everybody needs salvation 
 And if it doesn't come we make some 
 Some people can get by on nothing 
 But I still need to know I'm something 
 Just like in a dream I scream 
 But no one hears a word I'm saying 
 Have I lost my mind this time 
 Or have I won the game we're playing 
 That's all I really care about (care about) 
 It's kind of wonderful 
 Kiss me while we both are still intangible 
 Everybody needs salvation 
 And if it doesn't come we make some 
 Some people can get by on nothing 
 But I still need to know I'm something 
 Yes I still need to know I'm something 
 I'm ready to love you 
 I'm ready to give my heart 
 I'm ready to trust you 
 'Cause I ain't afraid of the dark 
 I'm ready to love you 
 I'm ready to give my heart 
 I'm ready to trust you 
 'Cause I ain't afraid (I ain't afraid) 
 I ain't afraid of the dark 
 Everybody needs salvation 
 And if it doesn't come we make some 
 Some people can get by on nothing 
 But I still need to know I'm something"

 Sippin' drinks at Starbucks 
 Didn't know what else to say 
 Except 
 Hey, little girl, would you rock my world? 
 'Cause I love who you are 
 You look like a lucky star 
 With that makeup on 
 Just like a young Madonna 
 Hey! I'm in love again 
 Do you remember prom night? 
 Your brother loves his country 
 Dad loves Ballroom Blitz 
 Mommy closed your Instagram 
 It was inappropriate 
 Maybe I'll go with you 
 Driving up Mulholland 
 On a teenage quest for a future husband 
 I said 
 Hey, little girl, would you rock my world? 
 'Cause I love who you are 
 You look like a lucky star 
 With that makeup on 
 Just like a young Madonna 
 Hey! I'm in love again 
 Do you remember prom night? 
 Gun me round 
 In your sweet Chevelle 
 We don't need 
 Any safety belts 
 Blast the Scorpions 
 Get weird and cool 
 Gonna play The Forum soon 
 Do you want to go? 
 Somehow we got separated 
 And I went back home all alone 
 I said 
 Hey, little girl, would you rock my world? 
 'Cause I love who you are 
 You look like a lucky star 
 With that makeup on 
 Just like a young Madonna 
 Hey! I'm in love again

 But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation 
 She's coming in, 12:30 flight 
 The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation 
 I stopped an old man along the way 
 Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies 
 He turned to me as if to say 
 ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you"" 
 It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you 
 There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do 
 I bless the rains down in Africa 
 Gonna take some time to do the things we never have 
 The wild dogs cry out in the night 
 As they grow restless longing for some solitary company 
 I know that I must do what's right 
 As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti 
 I seek to cure what's deep inside 
 Frightened of this thing that I've become 
 It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you 
 There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do 
 I bless the rains down in Africa 
 Gonna take some time to do the things we never have 
 Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you 
 It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you

 He just wanted to fit in. 
 Bobby no morals (bobby no morals lost his edge) 
 He was all along

 Ev'ry night when I go out to the bars 
 People think that I just came down from Mars 
 I don't say anything 
 This is why I sing 
 To get these stupid feelings off my chest 
 Ev'ry night when I go out chasing chicks 
 I drop a line, but nothing seems to stick 
 I fumble for my shoes 
 I sing the white-boy blues 
 A ghetto sucka gets some other dates 
 I don't say anything 
 This is why I sing 
 To get these stupid feelings off my chest"

 Straightening the curves 
 Flattening the hills 
 Well, someday the mountain might get 'em 
 But the law never will 
 Making their way 
 The only way they know how 
 That's just a little bit more 
 Than the law will allow

 Wouldn't change if they could 
 They're fighting the system 
 Like two modern-day Robin Hoods"

 A waste of every day 
 It's meaningless and sad

 That no one really wants to see you try

 I think you're a hundred times as good 
 Now what makes you want to stay? 
 I ask it everyday 
 It's not as if they had 
 Respect for what you say 
 'Cause they don't really want you to succeed 
 They're happy with the way you have a need for them 
 I think you should push them all away 
 Even if you stay and succeed 
 You will know that it's nonsense 
 And it doesn't wash off for a very long time 
 So don't be the one that didn't have the nerve 
 To stand up for yourself because you had to serve 
 Someone with some pretty dumb ideas"

 That you've been pretty cool

 You know it makes me laugh 
 To see you doing well 
 But it never fails to leave me so mystified 
 I'd like to know I don't think 
 That I will ever understand 
 Feeling pretty good about the big success 
 What makes people feel, the need to get their fill? 
 I guess it's not too hard to preach it to the choir 
 When you show them how to sing it and they sing along 
 I'd like to know I don't think that I will ever understand 
 It beats me down a little further every single day 
 I've made a natural selection of course it's none of the above 
 I'd like to know I don't think that I will ever understand 
 I want to feel like I don't have to try and understand"

 'Cause there is a book and it says that this is all true 
 I understand the need to feel safe 
 But this time you've gone way too far 
 It's easy to see when you believe 
 That we're all so evil inside 
 There are so many that want you to think that way

 Down your jock strap 
 Don't you talk back 
 'Cause she's still got a hold of you 
 When nothin's on my mind 
 She can't be far behind 
 Oh, beggin' me to stay 
 Or pushing me to crime 
 And I feel so helpless every time 
 That's what you get for being blind

 Take these brains out of my way 
 I work into a frenzied fit 
 I bite the corners of my lip 
 I'm losing my appetite 
 My pants don't even fit right 
 Take away the the month old dip 
 Give me something for my hair 
 A fresher pair of underwear 
 'Cause if I was run over 
 By a brand new range rover 
 I just want it, I don't care 
 No 
 Ooh, la la (he's trippin') 
 Shank ti da (mental slippin') 
 Take these brains out of my way 
 I tell the world to fuck itself 
 It's you who decides what sick or health 
 And all the people I see 
 That's making lots of Benji's 
 Make me want to puke myself 
 Start a brand new fashion trend 
 Those are for the deeper end 
 Sedatives and No Doz 
 And edible pantyhose 
 They're on your plate so dig right in! 
 No

 Pining away 
 O girl, I thought you were cool 
 Until you tried not to get hurt 
 But now I see in your eyes 
 The pain that can't be just mine 
 You're like me

 Carbon monoxide pies, 
 Causing layers of filth, to clog up my eyes

 And the Tokyo sun reaks of octopus 
 Take a ride on the Osaka Aquabus 
 Take a ride, escape the over-population crush 
 Times like these world would better fit if we just 
 Float away from the dust 
 A wise man told me there, ""You gotta breath in the Fuji air"" 
 Beautiful are trees, where are the euctalpyptus leaves? 
 And the Tokyo sun reaks of octopus 
 Take a ride on the Osaka Aquabus 
 Take a ride, escape the over-population crush 
 Times like these world would better fit if we just float away from the dust 
 Confucius says beware, 
 Life of mud is better than definite palace 
 That really made me think, 
 To thank for every little drink 
 It put a tear in my eye, 
 To never see a lotus blooming in the day time 
 So take a ride 
 In times the world would benefit 
 If we take a trip on the Aquabus"

238,Weezer,rock,The Christmas Song (Remix),"You told me you would be here by my side 
 Warming my heart on this cold winter's night 
 Here I sit waiting beside the tree all by myself (by myself) 
 You told me you would move heaven and earth 
 Cheering my spirits with laughter and mirth 
 Here I sit waiting beside the tree all by myself (by myself) 
 Oh, could you ever know how much I care? 
 Could you ever know that out somewhere 
 There's a boy who really hurts? 
 Since I've found you 
 I've found a girl 
 I've found a thorn 
 I've found a queen 
 Now I am warm 
 Oh, could you ever know how much I care? 
 Could you ever know that out somewhere 
 There's a boy who really hurts? 
 Since I've found you 
 I've found a girl 
 I've found a thorn 
 I've found a queen 
 Now I am warm 
 You told me you would move heaven and earth 
 Cheering my spirits with laughter and mirth 
 Here I sit waiting beside the tree all by myself (by myself) 
 Here I sit waiting beside the tree all by myself"
239,Weezer,rock,The Cruise,"And we sing (out of tune) 
 Come on! 
 There's so many of you, so many people I see 
 So many of you that I'd like to meet 
 There's so many things we could do 
 If you only knew 
 Jump with you, sleep with you, cheat on our soulmates and find 
 That some people care and some they don't mind 
 It don't matter we do what we do 
 As we break on through 
 And we sing 
 Out of tune 
 We are on the cruise (the cruise) 
 Optimistic right now, maybe I am 
 I know how so many people hate that 
 They'd rather see you lose 
 And drag you in the hole they're into 
 Jump with you, laugh with you, babble while they criticize 
 Let them say what they say, no I really don't mind 
 Just let them do what they do 
 As we break on through 
 And we sing 
 Out of tune 
 We are on the cruise (the cruise) 
 Sleep with you 
 Deceive with you 
 Laugh with you 
 Break on through to the cruise 
 Yeah 
 And we sing 
 Out of tune 
 We are on the cruise (the cruise) 
 There's so many of you, so many people I see 
 So many of you that I'd like to meet 
 So many things we could do on the cruise 
 We're on the cruise 
 We're on the cruise 
 We're on the cruise, we're on the cruise 
 We're on the cruise

241,Weezer,rock,The Lord Of Gym,"All steady up in the club, just swagging doing my thang 
 Popping bottles with models and just watching them drank 
 Partying so hard, the ladies don't want it to end 
 They looked at me and said, I heard that you're a heartbreaker 
 Baby I'm a troublemaker, I heard that you're a heartbreaker 
 Baby I'm a troublemaker, I heard that you're a heartbreaker 
 Baby I'm a troublemaker, I heard that you're a heartbreaker 
 Baby I'm a troublemaker 
 See I'm that type of guy you won't love 
 I'm that type of guy you won't cuff 
 I'm that type of guy you daddy won't let go out 
 'Cause he thinks I sell drugs 
 I'm that type of guy that will save ya 
 I'm that type that will call you later 
 Won't be around to give you that time 
 Gotta get on the grind and get to that paper that I can"
242,Weezer,rock,The Love I'm Searching For,"I don't think, I'll find the love I want 
 The love I'm searching for in this machine, oh 
 The System's Failed, all the circuits blown 
 And the message lost, in this machine oh 
 Tried all the codes, all possibilities 
 All combinations but still nothing, oh 
 Call for backup from my assistants but 
 No one seems to know anything, oh 
 Disconnect, shut the main reactor down 
 And separate from this technology, oh 
 I try, you know I try. I try e I y 
 Hard as it may be, I know you should be with me 
 Even thought it seems it's all lie e I ies 
 I still believe you should be with me 
 I don't think, I'll find the love I want 
 The love I'm searching for in this machine, oh 
 I try, you know I try. I try e I y 
 Hard as it may be, I know you should be with me 
 Even thought it seems it's all lie e I ies 
 I still believe you should be with me"
243,Weezer,rock,The Other Way Out,"I want to help you 
 But I don't know how 
 I want to soothe you 
 But I can't speak out 
 I have many fears about rejection 
 I have many memories of pain 
 I have always been a little shy 
 So I'll turn and look the other way 
 Other way, other way 
 I will turn and look the other way 
 I want to hold you 
 But I am afraid 
 I want to touch you 
 But I'm not that way 
 I have many doubts about my motives 
 I have many fears about my greed 
 I have always hurt the one that I love 
 So I'll turn and look the other way 
 Other way, other way 
 I will turn and look the other way 
 I have many doubts about my motives 
 I have many fears about my greed 
 I have always hurt the one that I love 
 So I'll turn and look the other way 
 Other way, other way 
 I will turn and look the other way 
 Other way, other way 
 I will turn and look the other way 
 Other way, other way 
 I will turn and look the other way

 The other way, the other way

 The other way, the other way"
244,Weezer,rock,The Prettiest Girl In The Whole World,"Fall leaves falling 
 Colder than air 
 Too bad she ain't coming 
 Alone right here 
 And I got the prettiest girl in the whole wide world 
 And nobody can take her from me 
 And if even when she goes out walking alone 
 I waited home patiently 
 I've never been so happy 
 I've never been so sure 
 Oh 
 Memories are gone 
 All in the wind 
 All the things return to me 
 All coming clear 
 I've got the prettiest girl in the whole wide world 
 And nobody can take her from me 
 And if even when she goes out walking alone 
 I waited home patiently 
 I've never been so happy 
 I've never been so sure 
 I've got the prettiest girl in the whole wide world 
 No one knows 
 Fun times are falling 
 All over again 
 Ten thousand calling 
 All of my time 
 I've got the prettiest girl in the whole wide world 
 And nobody can take her from me 
 And if even when she goes out walking alone 
 I waited home patiently 
 I've never been so happy 
 I've never been so sure 
 I've got the prettiest woman in the whole wide world 
 No one knows"
245,Weezer,rock,These Days,"These days (these days) 
 I may not be so happy 
 Afterall (afterall) 
 After all that I have gained 
 I still feel sad 
 When I'm all alone 
 I may have failed back at the K 
 I may not be so swift afterall 
 All the chances you have given me 
 I just let you go 
 I guess I've been like this before 
 Sometimes I can't stand up and be a man 
 But god why would I lose it now 
 When I need my strength at hand 
 You know sometimes I can be real cool 
 All the words just seem to flow right along 
 But when that girl aproaches me 
 Well it all goes wrong 
 These days (these days) 
 I may not be so happy 
 Afterall (afterall) 
 Afterall that I have gained 
 I still feel sad 
 When I'm all alone 
 These days leave me 
 Hopelessly delirious 
 I wish these days would end 
 Oh lease end 
 These days (these days) 
 I may not be so happy 
 After all (afterall) 
 After all that I have gained 
 I still feel sad 
 When I'm all alone 
 These days (these days) 
 I may not be so happy 
 Afterall (afterall) 
 Afterall the chances 
 You've given me 
 I just let you go"

 Of golden scenes 
 Stole away 
 All, it was in me 
 It wasn't me 
 Who slipped away 
 Now I stand with skin and bones 
 Without a dime to call my home 
 Only a voice to tell you 
 Thief, you've taken all that was me 
 Rain, It laughed so hard 
 It cried on me 
 You rain on me 
 Cleanse, cleanse my soul 
 The soul to be 
 The me to be 
 Now I stand with skin and bones 
 Without a dime to call my home 
 Only a voice to scream at you 
 Now I stand with skin and bones 
 Without a dime to call my home
