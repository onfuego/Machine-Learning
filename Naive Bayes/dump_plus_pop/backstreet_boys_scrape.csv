 For sentimental fools 
 And I'd never find someone 
 Who'd give their love so true

 Couldn't live my life without you in it 
 And now I want the whole wide world to know

 I know sometimes you feel 
 Like you don't fit in 
 And this world doesn't know 
 What you have within 
 When I look at you 
 I see something rare 
 A rose that can grow anywhere 
 And there's no one I know that can compare

 You got something so real 
 You touched me so deep 
 See, material things don't matter to me 
 So come as you are, you got nothing to prove 
 You won me with all that you do 
 And I wanna take this chance to say to you 
 What makes you different makes you beautiful 
 What's there inside you 
 Shines through to me 
 In your eyes I see all the love I'll ever need 
 (You're all I need oh girl) 
 What makes you different 
 Makes you beautiful... 
 You don't know how you touched my life 
 Oh in so many ways I just can't describe 
 You taught me what love is supposed to be 
 It's all the little things that make you beautiful to me

 And there's nowhere left to go 
 I know you give me sanctuary 
 You're the only truth I know 
 You're the road back home

 Standing here where I've always been

 This one is for the mothers 
 Who've lost a child 
 This one is for the gipsys 
 Who left their hearts behind 
 This is for the strangers 
 Sleeping in my heart 
 Take what they want 
 And leave while it's still dark 
 No one is glamourously 
 Lonely, all by themselves 
 This is a song for the unloved 
 This is a music for one last cry 
 This is a prayer that tomorrow will help me leave the past behind 
 It's a song for the unloved (the unloved) 
 This one's for the bridesmaid 
 Never the bride 
 This one's for the dreamers 
 Who locked their faith inside 
 This is for the widows 
 Who think there's only one 
 The dying fathers that never told their sons 
 No one is glamourously, lonely 
 Follow your heart 
 This is a song for the unloved 
 This is a music for one last cry 
 This is a prayer that tomorrow will help me leave the past behind 
 It's a song for the unloved (the unloved) 
 Oh 
 Tomorrow the sun will shine 
 And dry the tears in your eyes 
 Suddenly love comes alive 
 For one last cry 
 This is a song for the unloved 
 This is a music for one last cry 
 This is a prayer that tomorrow will help me leave the past behind 
 It's a song for the unloved (the unloved)

 Too late to call this is not like me 
 But I'm still lifted from the tattoo on the small of your back 
 The angle of your chin when you were looking back 
 See, god you're beautiful and I'm still coming down 
 I'd like a one-night stand, but you had to stick around 
 But I'm still floating on the perfume you left on my sheets 
 I haven't changed a thing since you abandoned me 
 Tonight I stare out the window 
 Knowing I'll never again be alone 
 Last night you changed my life 
 And I was stuck in the moment that you kissed me the first time 
 Last night you saved my life with your love 
 Saved my life 
 Last night you saved my life 
 Your fingernails running down my spine 
 All day I hear your voice like velvet in my mind 
 It's like I knew you all my life even though we just met 
 My children in your eyes, something you don't expect 
 I had to stop myself from calling all day long 
 I'm glad you called me first, I wanted to be strong 
 But you were laughing because I answered after just one ring 
 I tried to play it off 
 But you knew everything 
 Last night you changed my life 
 And I was stuck in the moment that you kissed me the first time 
 Last night you saved my life with your love 
 Saved my life (saved my life)

 Once there was a time, 
 Love was just a myth, 
 It just wasn't for real, 
 It didn't exist. 
 Until the day you came into my life, 
 It forced me to think twice. 
 I didn't have too much, 
 No I wasn't rich, 
 You made me believe someday, 
 I'd be more than this. 
 That's why until this day I'm still your man, 
 Cause you made me understand... 
 Love is, 
 Kisses in a bean bag chair 
 The two of us with no one there 
 Love is, 
 The moment that I climb the stairs 
 To hold you in my arms after we made love. 
 Love is, 
 Waking up to see your face, 
 Or kissing in the morning rain. 
 The only thing that keeps me sane, 
 At the end of the day is that I've got you. 
 You're my secret place, 
 Where I can be myself. 
 You connect with me, 
 Like nobody else. 
 Even though our circumstances changed, 
 Our love still remains. 
 Keep me on the ground, 
 Still you help me fly, 
 You taught me to be patient, 
 I taught you to rely, 
 So no matter what tomorrow brings, 
 We got the simple things cause...

 Or kissing in the morning rain. 
 The only thing that keeps me sane, 
 Is at the end of the day I've got you. 
 Love is, 
 A Sunday morning with the blanket wrapped around your waist. 
 Love is, 
 The way your lips seems to curve when you say my name. 
 Love is, 
 And when I'm stressing like the world's turnin' upside down. 
 Girl it all makes sense when you're around. 
 Love is, 
 Kisses in a bean bag chair

 Now my situation's taking a big change 
 They say the grass is greener on the other side of town 
 Now I'm kinda wishing you would come back around 
 Is she sad or is she mad? 
 Does she have a new man, does she have it like that? 
 It's been so long, thought I would've moved on 
 Could've been strong and picked up the telephone 
 I ask myself time and time again (again I'm trying to comprehend that) 
 Unanswered questions still (things to be are meant to end) 
 Am I over her? (am I over her?) 
 Am I over her? 
 Am I over her? 
 Tell me am I really over my my love (am I over her?)

 'Cause I'm too busy thinking of her 
 Am I really over my love? 
 It's water under the bridge 
 But I can't seem to forget 
 All the plans we made, all the time we spent 
 Makes me reminisce 
 I still see your face 
 All this love I can't replace 
 Am I over (am I over) 
 Am I over her? (her now) 
 Am I over her? 
 Am I over her? (am I) 
 Am I over her? (am I over)

 And as if these eyes would care 
 Your heart is in the right place so don't you go and change 
 Baby over and over the passion starts again 
 And the lollipops and everything with a little taste of sin 
 Causing fire and desire in this mortal soul to live 
 Till the angels fall from heaven and the day the earth stands still

 A thousand more regrets unraveling, oh 
 If you were here right now, I swear 
 I'd tell you this

 Keeping it inside is killing me

100,Backstreet Boys,pop,Something That I Already Know,"Here we are 
 Seven days 
 And seven nights of empty tries 
 This ritual's, habitual, 
 But it's never gonna work this time 
 We're to the point of no return 
 And along the way the only thing we've learned 
 Is how to hurt each other 
 I'm looking back 
 And wondering why 
 It took so long to realize 
 That nothing's changed 
 It never will 
 All these years of standing still 
 Still we'll stay in all this pain 
 And nothing's gonna make it go away 
 I don't wanna wait another minute 
 Put me out of my misery 
 I can read your mind 
 Baby you're not in it 
 We're not what we used to be, 
 No you wouldn't have to lie to me 
 If you would only let me go 
 And I don't wanna wait another minute 
 To hear 
 Something that I already know 
 I know I know I know 
 Something that I already know 
 I know I know I know 
 So save your voice 
 Don't waste your breath 
 Can't you see we're at the end 
 And this goodbye, feels permanent, 
 So wish me well, try to forget 
 All the fights 
 And all the ways 
 We almost made it 
 But we never did 
 And it's finally come to this 
 I don't wanna wait another minute 
 Put me out of my misery 
 I can read your mind 
 Baby you're not in it 
 We're not what we used to be, 
 No you wouldn't have to lie to me 
 If you would only let me go 
 And I don't wanna wait another minute 
 To hear 
 Something that I already know 
 We can not hide 
 What we've become 
 So sick and tired of being done, 
 It's done 
 It's done 
 It's done 
 I don't wanna wait another minute 
 Put me out of my misery 
 I can read your mind 
 Baby you're not in it 
 We're not what we used to be, 
 No you wouldn't have to lie to me 
 If you would only let me go 
 And I don't wanna wait another minute

 But I wear the scars 
 Reminding me by the hour

 I wish I could but... 
 Can't imagine it any other way 
 A world without you is only wasted space 
 You're gone and I'll always wonder 
 Why you can't be any other way, any other way. 
 Since you drained all the color out of the sky 
 How am I supposed to feel 
 It's like I'm living in somebody else's life 
 Tell me it's not real...

 Like the tears, they never hit the ground 
 Like your still here, your still here 
 Since you drained all the color out of the sky

 And my shirts turning red 
 I'm spinning around 
 Felt her lips on my neck 
 And her voice in my ear 
 Like I missed you 
 Want you tonight

 A single bullet got me 
 I can't stop the bleeding 
 Oh 
 Straight through my heart 
 She aimed and she shot me 
 I just can't believe it

 No I can't resist 
 And I can't be hit 
 I just can't escape this love

 Soldier down (my heart) 
 Soldier down (my heart) 
 Thought I moved 
 More than on 
 Thought I could 
 Fool her charm 
 I really wanna go 
 But I can't leave her alone 
 Oh oh 
 Hear the sound 
 Of a love so loud 
 I just can't, I just can't 
 Ignore this feeling 
 Said she misses me 
 And she wants me 
 Wants me tonight

 A single bullet got me 
 I can't stop the bleeding

 I fall in love all over again

 I lay my eyes on you

 Feel so helpless 
 Without you 
 It takes a piece of me 
 Each time you leave 
 I feel it in my chest 
 So hard to breathe 
 I feel so helpless 
 Without you 
 I feel so helpless 
 Without you 
 I witness every trick you got up your sleeve 
 But still somehow you keep on surprising me 
 I'm yours 
 I can't live without you 
 Don't wanna figure right how to 
 Every time I see you I feel like I 
 Could be the luckiest man in the world 
 Why try to fight it 
 There's no need to hide it 
 Because 
 You know 
 I fall in love all over again 
 Each time 
 I lay my eyes on you 
 I pretend 
 I feel so helpless 
 Without you 
 Feel so helpless

 It takes a piece of me 
 Each time you leave 
 I feel it in my chest 
 So hard to breathe 
 I feel so helpless 
 Without you 
 I feel so helpless 
 Without you 
 Feels like 
 I fall apart 
 Every time 
 Where do I start 
 I'm so helpless 
 Without you 
 Without you 
 Every time I close my eyes 
 You're the first thing that runs to my mind 
 Everywhere I go 
 I see you 
 Hear you 
 Feel you 
 I just wanna be near you 
 And heal' you 
 Last thing you said is how dare you 
 First thing I said is I'm sorry 
 Now I'm sitting here 
 Helpless 
 Man 
 Same old story 
 Now she's brokenhearted 
 Time heals all the wounds 
 She said 
 Not this time 
 It's true 
 Everyone plays a fool 
 And that fool is me 
 Because I foolishly 
 Took advantage of a woman who loved me 
 I fall in love all over again 
 Each time 
 I lay my eyes on you 
 I pretend 
 I feel so helpless 
 Without you 
 Feel so helpless 
 Without you

 And wonder where the ships would go 
 Who was on and what they would find out

 And said someday that this would be a story to tell 
 And you'd put it in a movie, maybe be the movie star 
 Something stole your tears and wiped your smile away

 I guess it was the wrong, wrong side of goodbye 
 You caught me on the blind, blind, blind side 
 You didn't even stop once to think twice 
 Drove through the pouring rain 
 Weaved in and out of pain 
 Wanted to turn around, turn around 
 Wish I'd have done it now 
 I still remember how we left it that night 
 Said it was better if we both just moved along

 I'll keep a light, I'll leave a light, light on

 Leave a light on, I leave a light on

 We didn't lose the beat, beat, beat in our hearts 
 After falling in so deep, so hard 
 So if you're running round, round, round in the dark 
 I'll find a way to reignite the spark

 To escape the love that I will forever know 
 Where can we go from here? 
 All I know is that I love you still 
 Sometimes we do things against our will 
 I know I cry lonely tears 
 Where can we go from here? 
 Why, Why do I cry inside? 
 When love is gone away 
 And how, How can I carry on 
 When I know all the love is gone 
 Where can I go to get away?

 With all that I regret 
 I pray for the first time in a long time

 I feel like I can let you go 
 Say everything I wanted to say 
 I'm okay with being alone 
 When I close my eyes 
 When I close my eyes 
 I'm alive 
 I never was sure but now I am 
 This was the choice I had to make 
 Maybe I'll never understand 
 Sometimes you gotta make mistakes 
 Finally I'm waking up 
 I feel like I can let you go 
 Say everything I wanted to say 
 I'm okay with being alone 
 Finally I face it off 
 I feel like I can let it show 
 I know I can walk away 
 I'm okay with being alone

 About this time of year 
 The Christmas feeling's everywhere 
 I just got home 
 To join You 
 I've been away too long 
 But now I'm back to share my love 
 Friends are reunited 
 One big family 
 Filled with love to last 
 Throughout the year 
 Christmas time 
 Time to share our love 
 Come and joy 
 The tidings to the world 
 Christmas time 
 The best time of the year 
 Yes, it's Christmas time 
 You and me together 
 A sleigh ride in the park 
 A loving kiss straight from my heart 
 Straight from the heart 
 Snowflakes are falling gently 
 The smell of chestnuts in the air 
 And Christmas lights they gleam 
 Across the sky 
 Do you remember? 
 Everything felt so right 
 When I held you close to me 
 Do you remember? 
 Those cold Christmas nights 
 When we sewed the world in harmony 
 Christmas time 
 Time to share our love 
 Come and joy 
 The tidings to the world 
 Christmas time 
 Always the best time"

 Broken glass on the floor from the picture frame 
 Shame, shame, shame 
 We had it all 
 This love so strong 
 Now everything 
 We had is gone 
 If you could read my mind 
 You'd know I've crossed that line 
 'Cause I'm as sick as my secrets 
 Yeah, it's killing me 
 You know that I mean it 
 I need you next to me 
 There's nowhere to run 
 Girl I can't let you go 
 And it's twisted I know 
 But I just can't take it no more 
 Six miles, twelve lights till your front door 
 I'm on my way just like I have so many times before 
 Does he know that it's me you've been talking to? 
 Shame, shame, shame 
 If you could read my mind 
 I'm gonna fight to get you back this time 
 'Cause I'm as sick as my secrets 
 Yeah, it's killing me 
 You know that I mean it 
 I need you next to me 
 There's nowhere to run 
 Girl I can't let you go 
 And it's twisted I know 
 But I just can't take it no more 
 I'm tired of all these lies 
 There's nothing but regret behind these eyes 
 All this love I could never show 
 I don't care any more 
 Give a damn who knows 
 'Cause I'm as sick as my secrets 
 Yeah, it's killing me 
 You know that I mean it 
 I need you back with me 
 There's nowhere to run 
 Girl I can't let you go 
 And it's twisting my soul 
 But I just can't take it no more 
 Sick as my secrets 
 Yeah, it's killing me 
 You know that I mean it 
 I need you next to me 
 There's nowhere to run (nowhere to run) 
 Girl I can't let you go (nowhere to hide) 
 And it's twisted I know 
 But I just can't take it no more 
 Yeah, I just can't leave you alone 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Tired of all the lies 
 Oh babe you've got me stripped of my pride 
 Gonna shout it from a mountain top 
 Yeah, drain the oceans from the tears we've cried 
 Gonna break down these walls 
 Gonna stand tall 
 Gonna be your man 
 Hope you understand, oh 
 That I'll never let you go"
170,Backstreet Boys,pop,The Best That I Can,"Oh, 
 Some say that love isn't fair, 
 But they don't know you and me, 
 And when they tell me that love doesn't last that long, 
 That's when I look at you,

 And anytime I feel afraid, 
 That's when I look at you, 
 With the best that I can,

171,Backstreet Boys,pop,There's Us,"There's Us (Cover of Alez Johnson's Song) 
 There's me looking down at my shoes 
 The one smiling like the sun that's you 
 What were you thinking? 
 What was the song inside your head? 
 There's us going on about a band 
 Working out how we'd play our hands 
 I lay there dreaming later on alone in my bed 
 If I was stupid maybe careless so were you 
 Not everything is supposed to come true 
 Some words are best unsaid some love is not really love at all 
 I'll keep everything I shared with you 
 And that's enough there's us 
 Freeze frame I'm not about to cry 
 Its to late for us to change why try 
 I got a camera tucked away inside my heart 
 If I'm a loser or just unlucky so are you 
 Not everything is supposed to come true 
 Some words are best unsaid some love is not really love at all 
 I'll keep everything I shared with you 
 And that's enough there's us 
 Somewhere between then and now 
 I looked away when you said we'll never change 
 And if you think we might have been 
 You'll lose today and we've got songs to play 
 Not everything is supposed to come true 
 Some words are best unsaid some love is not really love at all 
 I'll keep everything I shared with you 
 And that's enough there's us 
 Not everything is supposed to come true 
 Some words are best unsaid some love is not really love at all 
 I'll keep everything I shared with you 
 And that's enough there's us 
 There's us 
 There's us"
172,Backstreet Boys,pop,This I Promise You,"It's in the silences, the words you never say

 Does anybody ever stay in love, anymore? 
 I promise you from the bottom of my heart 
 I will love you till death do us part 
 I promise you as a lover and a friend 
 I will love you like I never love again 
 With everything I am 
 Ooh, I see you look at me when you think I'm not aware 
 You're searching for clues, of just how deep my feelings are 
 How do you prove the sky is blue, the oceans wide? 
 All I know is how I feel, when I look into your eyes 
 I promise you, from the bottom of my heart 
 I will love you till death do us part 
 I promise you as a lover and a friend 
 I will love you like I never love again 
 With everything that I am, ooh yeah 
 Oh, there are no guarantees 
 That's what you always say to me 
 But late at night, I feel the tremble in your touch 
 Oh what I'm trying to say to you 
 I never said to anyone, ""I promise"" 
 I promise you, from the bottom of my heart 
 I will love you till death do us part 
 (I do, my darling, I promise you) 
 I promise you as a lover and a friend 
 I will love you like I never love again
