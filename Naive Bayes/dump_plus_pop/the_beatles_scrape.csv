 Way down South they had a jubilee 
 Them Georgia folks they had a jamboree 
 They're drinkin' homebrew from a wooden cup 
 The folks were dancin' and got all shook up 
 And started playin' that rock and roll music 
 Any old time you use it 
 It's got a back beat, you can't lose it 
 Any old time you use it 
 Gotta be rock-roll music 
 If you wanna dance with me 
 If you wanna dance with me 
 Don't care to hear them play a tango 
 I'm in no mood to take a mambo 
 It's way too early for a congo 
 So keep on rockin' that piano 
 That's why I go for that rock and roll music 
 Any old time you use it 
 It's got a black beat, you can't lose it 
 Any old time you use it 
 Oughta got rock-roll music 
 If you wanna dance with me 
 If you wanna dance with me"

 She once had me 
 She showed me her room, isn't it good

 She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere

 I sat on a rug biding my time 
 Drinking her wine 
 We talked until two and then she said: 
 ""It's time for bed"" 
 She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh 
 I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath

 This bird had flown

 The ruins of the life that you have in mind

 I know your mind's made up 
 You're gonna cause more misery 
 Do what you want to do 
 And go where you're going to 
 Think for yourself 
 'Cause I won't be there with you 
 Although your mind's opaque 
 Try thinking more if just for your own sake 
 The future still looks good 
 And you've got time to rectify 
 All the things that you should 
 Do what you want to do 
 And go where you're going to 
 Think for yourself

 I've got something I can laugh about 
 I feel good 
 In a special way 
 I'm in love and it's a sunny day 
 Good day, sunshine 
 Good day, sunshine 
 Good day, sunshine 
 We take a walk 
 The sun is shining down 
 Burns my feet as they touch the ground 
 Good day, sunshine 
 Good day, sunshine 
 Good day, sunshine 
 Then we lie 
 Beneath the shady tree 
 I love her and she's loving me 
 She feels good (she does) 
 She knows she's looking fine 
 I'm so proud to know that she is mine 
 Good day, sunshine 
 Good day, sunshine 
 Good day, sunshine 
 Good day, sunshine 
 Good day, sunshine 
 Good day, sunshine 
 Good day, sunshine 
 (Good day, sunshine) 
 (Good day, sunshine)

91,The Beatles,rock,And Your Bird Can Sing,"Tell me that you've got everything you want 
 And your bird can sing 
 But you don't get me 
 You don't get me 
 You say you've seen seven wonders 
 And your bird is green 
 But you can't see me 
 You can't see me 
 When your prized possessions 
 Start to weigh you down 
 Look in my direction 
 I'll be 'round 
 I'll be 'round 
 When your bird is broken 
 Will it bring you down? 
 You may be awoken 
 I'll be 'round 
 I'll be 'round 
 You tell me that you heard every sound there is 
 And your bird can swing 
 But you can't hear me 
 You can't hear me"
92,The Beatles,rock,For No One,"Your day breaks 
 Your mind aches 
 You find that all her words of kindness linger on 
 When she no longer needs you 
 She wakes up 
 She makes up 
 She takes her time 
 And doesn't feel she has to hurry 
 She no longer needs you 
 And in her eyes you see nothing 
 No sign of love behind the tears 
 Cried for no one 
 A love that should have lasted years 
 You want her 
 You need her 
 And yet you don't believe her 
 When she says her love is dead 
 You think she needs you 
 And in her eyes you see nothing 
 No sign of love behind the tears 
 Cried for no one 
 A love that should have lasted years 
 You stay home 
 She goes out 
 She says that long ago 
 She knew someone but now he's gone 
 She doesn't need him 
 Your day breaks 
 Your mind aches 
 There will be times 
 When all the things she said will fill your head 
 You won't forget her 
 And in her eyes you see nothing 
 No sign of love behind the tears 
 Cried for no one 
 A love that should have lasted years"

94,The Beatles,rock,I Want To Tell You,"I want to tell you 
 My head is filled with things to say 
 When you're here 
 All those words, they seem to slip away 
 When I get near you 
 The games begin to drag me down 
 It's all right 
 I'll make you maybe next time around 
 But if I seem to act unkind 
 It's only me 
 It's not my mind 
 That is confusing things 
 I want to tell you 
 I feel hung up but I don't know why 
 I don't mind 
 I could wait forever 
 I've got time 
 Sometimes I wish I knew you well 
 Then I could speak my mind 
 And tell you 
 Maybe you'd understand

 I don't mind 
 I could wait forever 
 I've got time

 Could see another kind of mind there

 Ooh, did I tell you I need you 
 Every single day of my life? 
 You didn't run, you didn't lie 
 You know I wanted just to hold you 
 And had you gone, you knew in time 
 We'd meet again, for I had told you 
 Ooh, you were meant to be near me 
 Ooh, and I want you to hear me 
 Say we'll be together every day 
 Got to get you into my life 
 Somehow, someway 
 What can I do? What can I be? 
 When I'm with you I wanna stay there 
 If I'm true, I'll never leave 
 And if I do I know the way there 
 Ooh, then I suddenly see you 
 Ooh, did I tell you I need you 
 Every single day of my life? 
 Got to get you into my life 
 I've got to get you into my life 
 I was alone, I took a ride

96,The Beatles,rock,Tomorrow Never Knows,"Turn off your mind 
 Relax and float down stream 
 It is not dying 
 It is not dying 
 Lay down all thought 
 Surrender to the void 
 It is shining 
 It is shining 
 That you may see 
 The meaning of within 
 It is being 
 It is being 
 That love is all 
 And love is everyone 
 It is knowing 
 It is knowing 
 That ignorance and hate 
 May mourn the dead 
 It is believing 
 It is believing 
 But listen to the 
 Colour of your dreams 
 It is not living 
 It is not living 
 Or play the game 
 Existence to the end 
 Of the beginning 
 Of the beginning 
 Of the beginning"

 I can't tell you but I know it's mine

99,The Beatles,rock,Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds,"Picture yourself in a boat on a river 
 With tangerine trees and marmalade skies 
 Somebody calls you you answer quite slowly 
 A girl with kaleidoscope eyes 
 Cellophane flowers of yellow and green 
 Towering over your head 
 Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes 
 And she's gone 
 Lucy in the sky with diamonds 
 Lucy in the sky with diamonds 
 Lucy in the sky with diamonds 
 Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain 
 Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies 
 Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers 
 That grow so incredibly high 
 Newspaper taxis appear on the shore 
 Waiting to take you away 
 Climb in the back with your head in the clouds 
 And you're gone 
 Lucy in the sky with diamonds 
 Lucy in the sky with diamonds 
 Lucy in the sky with diamonds 
 Picture yourself on a train in a station 
 With plasticine porters with looking-glass ties 
 Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile 
 The girl with kaleidoscope eyes 
 Lucy in the sky with diamonds 
 Lucy in the sky with diamonds 
 Lucy in the sky with diamonds"
100,The Beatles,rock,Getting Better,"It's getting better all the time 
 I used to get mad at my school (Now I can't complain) 
 The teachers that taught me weren't cool (No I can't complain) 
 You're holding me down (Ah), turning me 'round (Oh) 
 Filling me up with your rules (Fool) 
 I've got to admit it's getting better (Better) 
 A little better all the time (It can't get no worse) 
 I have to admit it's getting better (Better) 
 It's getting better since you've been mine 
 Me used to be angry young man 
 Me hiding me head in the sand 
 You gave me the word, I finally heard 
 I'm doing the best that I can 
 I've got to admit it's getting better (Better) 
 A little better all the time (It can't get no worse) 
 I have to admit it's getting better (Better) 
 It's getting better since you've been mine 
 Getting so much better all the time 
 It's getting better all the time 
 (Better, better, better) 
 It's getting better all the time 
 (Better, better, better) 
 I used to be cruel to my woman 
 I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved 
 Man I was mean but I'm changing my scene 
 And I'm doing the best that I can 
 I admit it's getting better (Better) 
 A little better all the time (It can't get no worse) 
 Yes I admit it's getting better (Better) 
 It's getting better since you've been mine

101,The Beatles,rock,Fixing A Hole,"I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in 
 And stops my mind from wandering 
 Where it will go 
 I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door 
 And kept my mind from wandering 
 Where it will go 
 And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong 
 I'm right where I belong 
 I'm right where I belong 
 See the people standing there 
 Who disagree and never win 
 And wonder why they don't get in my door 
 I'm painting the room in a colourful way 
 And when my mind is wandering 
 There I will go 
 And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong 
 I'm right where I belong 
 I'm right where I belong 
 Silly people run around 
 They worry me and never ask me 
 Why they don't get past my door 
 I'm taking the time for a number of things 
 That weren't important yesterday 
 And I still go 
 I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in 
 And stops my mind from wandering 
 Where it will go 
 Where it will go"
102,The Beatles,rock,She's Leaving Home,"Wednesday morning at five o'clock 
 As the day begins 
 Silently closing her bedroom door 
 Leaving the note that she hoped would say more 
 She goes downstairs to the kitchen 
 Clutching her handkerchief 
 Quietly turning the back door key 
 Stepping outside she is free 
 She (We gave her most of our lives) 
 Is leaving (Sacrificed most of our lives) 
 Home (We gave her everything money could buy) 
 She's leaving home after living alone (Bye bye) 
 For so many years 
 Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown 
 Picks up the letter that's lying there 
 Standing alone at the top of the stairs 
 She breaks down and cries to her husband 
 ""Daddy, our baby's gone"" 
 Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly? 
 How could she do this to me? 
 She (We never thought of ourselves) 
 Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves) 
 Home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by) 
 She's leaving home after living alone (Bye bye) 
 For so many years 
 Friday morning at nine o'clock 
 She is far away 
 Waiting to keep the appointment she made 
 Meeting a man from the motor trade 
 She (What did we do that was wrong?) 
 Is having (We didn't know it was wrong) 
 Fun (Fun is the one thing that money can't buy) 
 Something inside that was always denied (Bye bye) 
 For so many years 
 She's leaving home 
 Bye bye"
103,The Beatles,rock,Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite!,"For the benefit of Mr. Kite 
 There will be a show tonight on trampoline 
 The Hendersons will all be there 
 Late of Pablo Fanque's fair, what a scene 
 Over men and horses hoops and garters 
 Lastly through a hogshead of real fire 
 In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world 
 The celebrated Mr. K. 
 Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate 
 The Hendersons will dance and sing 
 As Mr. Kite flies through the ring, don't be late 
 Messrs. K. and H. assure the public 
 Their production will be second to none 
 And of course Henry the Horse dances the waltz 
 The band begins at ten to six 
 When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound 
 And Mr. H. will demonstrate 
 Ten somersets he'll undertake on solid ground 
 Having been some days in preparation 
 A splendid time is guaranteed for all 
 And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill"
104,The Beatles,rock,Within You Without You,"We were talking about the space between us all 
 And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion 
 Never glimpse the truth 
 Then it's far too late 
 When they pass away 
 We were talking about the love we all could share when we find it 
 To try our best to hold it there 
 With our love 
 With our love we could save the world 
 If they only knew 
 Try to realize it's all within yourself 
 No one else can make you change 
 And to see you're really only very small 
 And life flows on within you and without you 
 We were talking about the love that's gone so cold 
 And the people who gain the world and lose their soul 
 They don't know 
 They can't see 
 Are you one of them? 
 When you've seen beyond yourself 
 Then you may find peace of mind is waiting there 
 And the time will come when you see 
 We're all one and life flows on within you and without you"
105,The Beatles,rock,When I'm Sixty-Four,"When I get older, losing my hair 
 Many years from now 
 Will you still be sending me a Valentine? 
 Birthday greetings, bottle of wine? 
 If I'd been out till quarter to three 
 Would you lock the door? 
 Will you still need me, will you still feed me 
 When I'm sixty-four? 
 You'll be older too 
 And if you say the word 
 I could stay with you 
 I could be handy mending a fuse 
 When your lights have gone 
 You can knit a sweater by the fireside 
 Sunday mornings, go for a ride 
 Doing the garden, digging the weeds 
 Who could ask for more? 
 Will you still need me, will you still feed me 
 When I'm sixty-four? 
 Every summer we can rent a cottage in the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear 
 We shall scrimp and save (we shall scrimp and save) 
 Grandchildren on your knee 
 Vera, Chuck, and Dave 
 Send me a postcard, drop me a line 
 Stating point of view 
 Indicate precisely what you mean to say 
 Yours sincerely wasting away 
 Give me your answer, fill in a form 
 Mine for evermore 
 Will you still need me, will you still feed me 
 When I'm sixty-four?"
106,The Beatles,rock,Lovely Rita,"Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh 
 Lovely Rita, meter maid 
 Lovely Rita, meter maid 
 Lovely Rita, meter maid 
 Nothing can come between us 
 When it gets dark I tow your heart away 
 Standing by a parking meter 
 When I caught a glimpse of Rita 
 Filling in the ticket in her little white book 
 In a cap she looked much older 
 And the bag across her shoulder 
 Made her look a little like a military man 
 Lovely Rita, meter maid 
 May I inquire discreetly 
 When are you free to take some tea with me? 
 Rita 
 Took her out and tried to win her 
 Had a laugh and over dinner 
 Told her I would really like to see her again 
 Got the bill and Rita paid it 
 Took her home and nearly made it 
 Sitting on a sofa with a sister or two 
 Oh lovely Rita, meter maid 
 Where would I be without you? 
 Give us a wink and make me think of you 
 Lovely Rita, meter maid 
 They'll never believe it"

 Everybody knows there's nothing doing 
 Everything is closed, it's like a ruin 
 Everyone you see is half asleep 
 And you're on your own, you're in the street 
 After a while you start to smile, now you feel cool 
 Then you decide to take a walk by the old school 
 Nothing has changed, it's still the same 
 I've got nothing to say but ""It's okay""

 Watching the skirts you start to flirt, now you're in gear 
 Go to a show, you hope she goes

109,The Beatles,rock,A Day In The Life,"I read the news today, oh boy 
 About a lucky man who made the grade 
 And though the news was rather sad 
 Well, I just had to laugh 
 I saw the photograph 
 He blew his mind out in a car 
 He didn't notice that the lights had changed 
 A crowd of people stood and stared 
 They'd seen his face before 
 Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords 
 I saw a film today, oh boy 
 The English army had just won the war 
 A crowd of people turned away 
 But I just had to look 
 Having read the book 
 I'd love to turn you on 
 (One) 
 Woke up, fell out of bed 
 Dragged a comb across my head 
 Found my way downstairs and drank a cup 
 And looking up, I noticed I was late 
 (Huh, huh, huh, huh) 
 Found my coat and grabbed my hat 
 Made the bus in seconds flat 
 Found my way upstairs and had a smoke 
 And somebody spoke and I went into a dream 
 Ah, ah ah ah 
 Ah ah ah, ah ah ah 
 Ah 
 Ah, ah ah ah, ah ah ah 
 I read the news today, oh boy 
 Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire 
 And though the holes were rather small 
 They had to count them all 
 Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall 
 I'd love to turn you on"

 The man with the foolish grin 
 Is keeping perfectly still 
 But nobody wants to know him 
 They can see that he's just a fool 
 And he never gives an answer 
 But the fool on the hill 
 Sees the sun going down 
 And the eyes in his head 
 See the world spinning round 
 Well on the way, head in a cloud 
 The man of a thousand voices 
 Talking perfectly loud 
 But nobody ever hears him 
 Or the sound he appears to make 
 And he never seems to notice 
 But the fool on the hill 
 Sees the sun going down 
 And the eyes in his head 
 See the world spinning round 
 And nobody seems to like him 
 They can tell what he wants to do 
 And he never shows his feelings 
 But the fool on the hill 
 Sees the sun going down 
 And the eyes in his head 
 See the world spinning round 
 Ohh oh-oh-oh-oh ohh-oh-oh 
 Round and round and round and round and round 
 He never listens to them 
 He knows that they're the fool 
 They don't like him

 Sees the sun going down 
 And the eyes in his head 
 See the world spinning round

117,The Beatles,rock,Penny Lane,"In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs 
 Of every head he's had the pleasure to know 
 And all the people that come and go 
 Stop and say hello 
 On the corner is a banker with a motorcar 
 The little children laugh at him behind his back 
 And the banker never wears a mac 
 In the pouring rain 
 Very strange 
 Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes 
 There beneath the blue suburban skies 
 I sit and meanwhile back 
 In Penny Lane, there is a fireman with an hour glass 
 And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen 
 He likes to keep his fire engine clean 
 It's a clean machine 
 Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes 
 Four of fish and finger pies in summer 
 Meanwhile back 
 Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout 
 A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray 
 And though she feels as if she's in a play 
 She is anyway 
 In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer 
 We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim 
 And then the fireman rushes in 
 From the pouring rain 
 Very strange 
 Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes 
 There beneath the blue suburban skies 
 I sit and meanwhile back 
 Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes 
 There beneath the blue suburban skies

 And for all the little piggies 
 Life is getting worse 
 Always having dirt to play around in 
 Have you seen the bigger piggies 
 In their starched white shirts? 
 You will find the bigger piggies 
 Stirring up the dirt 
 Always have clean shirts to play around in 
 In their sties with all their backing 
 They don't care what goes on around 
 In their eyes there's something lacking 
 What they need's a damn good whacking 
 Everywhere there's lots of piggies 
 Living piggy lives 
 You can see them out for dinner 
 With their piggy wives 
 Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon 
 Spoken: 
 One more time"
132,The Beatles,rock,Rocky Raccoon,"Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota 
 There lived a young boy name o' Rocky Raccoon-a 
 And one day his woman ran off with another guy 
 Hit young Rocky in the eye 
 Rocky didn't like that 
 He said, ""I'm gonna get that boy"" 
 So one day he walked into town 
 Booked himself a room in the local saloon 
 Rocky Raccoon 
 Checked into his room 
 Only to find Gideon's Bible 
 Rocky had come 
 Equipped with a gun 
 To shoot off the legs of his rival 
 His rival, it seems 
 Had broken his dreams 
 By stealing the girl of his fancy 
 Her name was Magill 
 And she called herself Lil 
 But everyone knew her as Nancy 
 Now, she and her man 
 Who called himself Dan 
 Were in the next room at the hoedown 
 A-Rocky burst in 
 And grinning a grin 
 He said, ""Danny, boy, this is a showdown!"" 
 But Daniel was hot 
 And he drew first and shot 
 And Rocky collapsed in the corner 
 Aah 
 Da-d'n da da da da da 
 Daa-d'l da da da da da 
 Daa-d'l da da da da da 
 Da-da da da-da ndoo ndoo-doo-doo

 Dooodle-doo-doo-doo ndoo-doo-dooo 
 Doo doodle-doo doo-doodle-doo 
 Doo-doodle-doo doo-doodle-doo 
 La-ta ndoo dloo-doo-doo 
 Now the doctor came in 
 Stinking of gin 
 And proceeded to lie on the table 
 He said, ""Rocky, you met your match"" 
 And Rocky said, ""Doc, it's only a scratch 
 And I'll be better 
 I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able"" 
 A-now Rocky Raccoon 
 He fell back in his room 
 Only to find Gideon's Bible (Daa da-da-da) 
 A-Gideon checked out (Poor) 
 And he left it no doubt (Rocky) 
 To help with good Rocky's revival (Ohhh) 
 Aah 
 Oh, yeah, yeah'n

 Calls her on the phone 
 ""Can I take you out to the pictures, Jo-oh-oh-oan?"" 
 But as she's getting ready to go 
 A knock comes on the door 
 Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer 
 Came down upon her head 
 Clang, clang, Maxwell's silver hammer 
 Made sure she was dead 
 Back in school again 
 Maxwell plays the fool again 
 Teacher gets annoyed 
 Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene 
 She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away 
 So he waits behind 
 Writing fifty times ""I must not be so, oh-oh, oh"" 
 But when she turns her back on the boy 
 He creeps up from behind 
 Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer 
 Came down upon her head (do-do do-doo-doo) 
 Clang, clang, Maxwell's silver hammer 
 Made sure that she was dead 
 (Do-do do-doo-doo) 
 P.C. 31 said ""We've caught a dirty one"" 
 Maxwell stands alone 
 Painting testimonial pictures, oh, oh-oh, oh 
 Rose and Valerie, screaming from the gallery 
 Say he must go free (""Maxwell must go free"") 
 The judge does not agree, and he tells them so, oh-oh, oh 
 But as the words are leaving his lips 
 A noise comes from behind 
 Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer 
 Came down upon his head (do-do do-doo-doo)

 Made sure that he was dead

 (All): Good King Wenceslas looked out 
 On the feast of Stephen (Hoo!) 
 As the slow ray round about 
 Deep and crisp and crispy 
 Brightly show the boot last night 
 On the mosty cruel 
 Henry Hall and David Lloyd 
 Betty Grable too-ooh-ooh 
 (J): Hello, this is John, speaking with his voice. (Huh!) 
 We're all very happy to be able to talk to you like this on this little bit of plastic. This record reaches you at the end of a really gear year for us, and it's all due to you. When we made our first record on Parlophone towards the end of 1962, we hoped everybody would like what had already been our type of music for several years already. But we had no idea of all the gear things in store for us. It all happened really when 
 Please Please Me 
 became a number one hit and after that, well cor' the blimeys, heave the mo'! Our biggest thrill of the year, well, I suppose it must have been topping the bill at the London Palladium and then, only a couple of days later, being invited to take part in The Royal Variety Show. This time last year, we were all dead chuffed because ""Love Me Do"" got into the top twenty, and we can't believe really that so many things have happened in between already! Just before I pass you over to Paul, (Arf-arf! Arf-arf!) I'd like to say thank you to all the Beatle people who have written to me during the year and everyone who sent gifts and cards for my birthday, which I'm trying to forget, in October. (Huh!) I'd like to reply personally to everyone, but I just haven't enough pens. In the meantime: 
 Garry Crimble to you 
 Garry Mimble to you 
 Getty Bable, dear Christmas 
 Happy Birthday me too 
 (P): This is Paul here. 
 Everything that John said goes for me too, 'specially the bit about birthday cards and the parcels, 'cause all our homes and offices got stacks of mail last June, ow! Ha! Ha! When it was my birthday. Anyway, we're all dead pleased by the way you've treated us in 1963, and we'll try to do everything we can to please you with the type of songs we write and record next year. Oh yeah, somebody asked us if we still like jelly babies. Well! We used to like them, in fact we loved them and said so in one of the papers, you see. Ever since then, we've been getting them in boxes, packets and crates. Anyway, we've gone right off jelly babies, you see, but we still like peppermint creams and chocolate drops and dolly mixtures and all that sort of thing. (Yes! Yes! Oh yes!) 
 Well, lots of people asked us what we enjoy best, you see, concerts and television or recording? We like doing stage shows 'cause it's, you know, it's great to hear an audience enjoying themselves. But the thing we like best, I think so anyway, is going into the recording studio (yes, we enjoy that very kindly) to make new records, which is what we've been doing all day before we started on this special message. Well, eh, what we like to hear most is one of our songs, you know, taking shape in a recording studio, ah, one of the ones what John and I have written, and then listening to the tapes afterwards to hear how it all worked out, you see. Well, I'm running over my time, and people are telling me to stop, (Stop! Stop!) and Ringo, (Stop! Stop! Shouting those animals!) so I'll finish off now with it wishing everyone Happy Crimble and a Merry New Year and especially all the ones who paid the subscription.

So on behalf of us all, I'd just like to say a great, big thank you to Ann, Bettina and Freda for all the hard work they've done, and we just hope you can go on pleasing you for a long time, 'cause it's gonna, 'cause it to your reaction are to our records that really matters.

 (J): Yes, we are.

 (J): Once upon a time, there were two balloons called 
 Jock and Yono. They were strictly in love, bound to happen 
 In a million years. They were together man. Unfortunate 
 Timetable, they seemed to have previous experience which 
 Kept calling them one way or another. You know how it is. 
 But they battled on against overwhelming oddities, 
 Including some of their beast friends. Being in love, 
 They clung together even more man. But some of the 
 Poisonous monsters' outdated boss - lordy ape claws did 
 Stick slightly, and they occasionally had to resort to 
 The dry cleaners. Luckily, this did not kill them and 
 They weren't banned form the Olympic Games. They lived 
 Hopefully ever after and who could blame them? 
 (G): Well, here we are again, another fab Christmas. Christmas 
 Time is here again. Ain't been around since last year. 
 And we'd like to take this opportunity, all the way from 
 America, to say happy Christmas to you our faithful, 
 Beloved fans all over the world who have made our life 
 Worth living. And over here I have Mr. Malcolm Evans who 
 Through thick and thin would surely like to say a word 
 Of greeting at this festive occasion.

 (J): Once upon a pool table there lived a short-haired 
 Butcher's boy by the way of Ostergrad. It comes in 
 Scented cesspool or be careful. Her father was in a 
 Long story cut short in the middle of his life sentence. 
 We're indebted to the colloquial office for its immediate 
 Disposal of her honorwitz, including, I might add, half a 
 Fell of her twotem (*hoc virtallo a totem?). On the other handbag, I mean to say 
 L'amoure ne soome tu joure realistic, strictly speaking. 
 For this film is about an hourglass houseboat. The full 
 Meaning of Winchester Cathedral defies description. Their 
 Loss was our Gainsborough nil.

 Hall, and what a thrill it was, ah, to do this then, and 
 Now ... exactly the way I did it then. 
 (Singing) 
 He's a, ooh, real nowhere man, 
 Living in his nowhere land, 
 Making all his nowhere plans for nobody. 
 Hasn't got a point of view, 
 Knows not where he's going to,

 Nowhere man, (yes?) Don't worry, 
 Take your time, don't hurry,

 I know it sounds absurd but it's true 
 The magic in the mantra will give you the answer 
 Just swallow this that's all you gotta do 
 Everything you need is here 
 But everything that's not here is not there 
 And if there's something missing in this God almighty plan 
 Could it be you need a woman? 
 Well all you need to do is say this little word 
 I know it sounds absurd but it's true 
 The magic in the mantra will give you the answer 
 And swallow this that's all you gotta do 
 Take three times a day after every meal 
 All you need to do is say this little word 
 I know it sounds absurd but it's true 
 The magic in the mantra will give you the answer 
 And swallow this that's all you gotta do"

 It didn't come 
 Instead of watching rainbows 
 I'm gonna make me some 
 Instead of watching rainbows 
 I'm gonna make me some 
 Standing in the garden 
 Waiting for the English sun to come and make me brown so I can be someone 
 Lookin' at the bench of next door neighbours 
 Cryin' to my mum I'm tryin' to set sabors 
 Everybody's got to have something hard to grow 
 Well, instead of watching rainbows under the sun 
 You gotta get out son and make you one 
 You gotta get out son and make you run 
 Because you're not gonna make it if you cry, though 
 Shoot big! 
 Shoot big! 
 Whatever you do you gotta kill somebody 
 To get what you wanna get 
 You gotta shoot big! 
 You gotta shoot big! 
 Until you shoot big 
 I can't stand"
244,The Beatles,rock,A Picture Of You,"All I've got is a picture of you 
 Now that you've gone and left me blue 
 You don't hear me cry at night 
 And say sweet things to you 
 You don't hear me sing a love song to 
 A picture of you 
 I pretend that you're still here with me 
 Laughing just the way we used to be 
 But pictures they can't talk and they can't see 
 I know I'm in love and nothing more 
 Nothing more 
 I hope you'll be happy where you are 
 But if you need me I won't be to far 
 Standing in the shadow of my dreams 
 They say it's not as bad as it may seem 
 But they don't lie awake at night and cry the way I do 
 They don't realise that all I got 
 Is a picture of you"

 For some California grass

 E'en as the morn on the streamlet and sea, 
 Then will all clouds of sorrow depart, 
 Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me, 
 Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!"

 With hurry homedrops on her cheek

 I got no daddy's smile 
 Nobody wants me 
 I'm nobody's child 
 No mummy's arms to hold me 
 Or sue me when I cry 
 'Cause sometimes I feel so lonesome 
 I wish that I could die 
 I'll walk the streets of heaven 
 Where all blinds can see 
 And just like for the other kids 
 It will be a home for me 
 I'm nobody's child
