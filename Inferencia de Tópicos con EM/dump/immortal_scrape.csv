0,Immortal,metal,The Call Of The Wintermoon,"Buried beneath the mountains of frost 
 Years of silent sorrow grim and dark 
 My winterwings of evil sleeps in eternal nights 
 In death cold crypts of snow 
 The moon chimed my return 
 With the blackstorms I came 
 And not with the winds 
 The Northern darkness marches 
 Through the coldest night 
 I can't resist the taste from the winds of the wintermoon 
 I split my tongue for the taste of these winds 
 And bath my eyes in its grace 
 Frost and winter return to my eyes 
 The call of the wintermoon 
 Nocturnal clouds blows freely in the distance 
 In the grey mist of deaths horizon 
 My winterwings of evil sleeps 
 In deaths cold crypts of snow 
 Buried beneath the mountains of frost 
 Years of silent sorrow grim and dark 
 Into the eternal nights 
 Hearing the call of the wintermoon"
1,Immortal,metal,Unholy Forces Of Evil,"Slowly crossing as red rivers runs below 
 Forever passing where the darkness lies unknown 
 Where soulwinds burns my eyes 
 Where shadows of lost life hides 
 Enter the centres of darkness 
 Where all evil dwells 
 Demons present in flames 
 Oath of black souls found 
 Sacrifices as old as the earth 
 We cut the living flesh 
 Circles of the deepest black throned 
 A promise of the darkest blood found 
 Unholy forces of evil 
 Unholy forces of hell 
 An mayhemic silence floats 
 We await our signs of death our circles gathered 
 Ceremonial powers belongs to us 
 A goat baptised in fire 
 We dance the circle dance the thorns 
 Awaiting the sign of the horns 
 A thousand black clouds storms 
 Blasphemous Northern rites 
 Mysticism touched 
 Pentagrams burning 
 Into the centres of the darkness 
 Where all evil dwells 
 Demons present in flames 
 Oath of black souls found 
 The unholy forces of evil 
 Server upon our diabolical souls 
 Cults of death bathed in slaught 
 As the devils candles burns 
 Into the dark skies 
 Floating with the soulwinds of the pentagram 
 To the deathlights where the North star awaits"
2,Immortal,metal,Cryptic Winterstorms,"A black sunset rises under the funeral sky 
 The freezing waters below as mirrors made of funeral mist 
 The blasting sky above and the fullmoon is on the rise. 
 My hear blows in the winds of reap 
 Still I float with the cold diabolical massacrewinds 
 On the bestial wings of evil 
 Above the mountainside and into cryptic winterstorms 
 I long for eternal frost and black winters 
 Asleep in the cold lakes awake in the stars in the sky 
 And silent the walleyes in the North 
 Where I once were a proud warrior 
 Where I belong where I bath my soul in doom fire fog 
 Where I ride deaths cold winds in the battles in the North 
 As a Norse warrior I rode the dark walleyes 
 With longsword in hand sworned to throne dark lands 
 And to return to my master in the blue mist of the dying sunset 
 A black sunset dies under the funeral sky 
 My hair blows into winds of reap 
 Still I float with the cold diabolical massacrewinds 
 On the overshadowed bestial wings of evil 
 Above the mountainside and into cryptic winterstorms forever"

 In the blue mist of evil 
 Through the dark Northern walleyes 
 Where only winds of funeral breathes 
 Hovering through the whispering darkness 
 With frost in my eyes 
 Only seven winds are heard 
 Chiming through the dark Northern walleyes 
 Eternity I pass eternity I sought

 For Satan my black soul 
 Under a blood-red moon in the cold waters of another world 
 Where winter shadows lies untouched 
 Where I dwell at the mountains of madness 
 Entering with the cold winds of funeral dust"

 In the cold Northern breeze 
 Under the red skies 
 Surrounded by blasphemous winds 
 Midnight passing and the moon is fulfilled 
 Slowly blackening the sky 
 I summon up where the ravens fly high 
 Towards the moons of Blashyrkh 
 Death rides on black wings 
 Evil enter the sly 
 Angels falls from the heavens 
 While tile darkness shines through 
 Chariots of the darkest masters arrives on devil wings 
 Heavens angels surrounded by frost 
 Forces into the holocaust frozen clouds 
 A twisted wind rapes the clouds 
 Memories of cold days and lightning returns

 Under the horned goatmoon 
 As dark as black rivers at wintertime 
 Horned December moon come to me 
 I ride the wings of Torment 
 Blacker than darkness"

 At one with the poisoned ground 
 Midnight dark sky open up 
 A blast of red lightning rides the night 
 With dooms winds deaths angels fly 
 Across an nearly closed skyline 
 And the sun freezes at one with the infernal holocaust frozen clouds 
 Centuries of doom reigned by the Goathrone of desire 
 Raised by sorcery to the Holocaust sky 
 North black hordes storms 
 Through invisible cyclones of frostwinds I lift my hands 
 And join the ceremonial circle of the wind 
 Eyes of stone now sleeps into eternal night 
 This winter is forever 
 A wind of red I rode 
 A wind of evil cold 
 For the years that have passed in the North 
 Brought me visions of the Goathrone of desire 
 On the hillside where I stood I left for another world 
 Tragedies blows at horizon 
 The sun freezes to dust 
 A perfect vision of the rising Northland"

 Diabolic seven winds of hate 
 Breathe in the chasm of the realms 
 In clouds above horizon grey 
 A throne of ice 
 Watching silently with a warrior's eye 
 Winds of destruction fills our hearts 
 With joy portals to war lay before us

 Is the way for our enemies to die"

 You could see me come 
 To walk the endless woods alone 
 The earth is freezing 
 As I walk it become colder 
 Forever descending in a place of the moon 
 Where shadows moves with grotesque eyes 
 Where demons rise 
 Surrounded by black and mourning moonfog 
 And the eyes of the dark ones 
 Sempiternal woods wait only for me 
 A path opens clearly 
 The sun no longer rises 
 Over cold and forgotten valleys 
 The sun no longer rises

 To the north and into eternal winters 
 To the north in the grip of eternal frost"

 Beneath the mountains and passed beyond the gate below 
 Floating evil reign with fear in these sarcastic caves 
 Enlightened into a blacker dark for there are view in darkness

 Hardening claws of cold tell me we are closer to colder times 
 Through the days of bitterness still the tundra lay untouched 
 In the final of that day and all centuries after

 Blacker and blacker blinded by shades from centuries behind 
 Shadows of a dark that used to be under heavy winters reign...

 Yet winds of cold will always blow without tomorrow...

 Cometh the untamed ones, so shall we thrive to rule 'em all 
 The sum of wrath, soon to reveal it's evil sons 
 The wrath of the beast descend 
 Gathering storms in the sky 
 Daylight darkened, thunder of the ice 
 The wrath of the beast descend and call us to ice 
 Across the snows, the throne of all thrones 
 We are by darkness found, to reveal a time to come 
 The northern souls, built to survive the eternal cold 
 Where the frost never cease, where the wind sing eternally 
 The heart of winter, that precede the end of the world"
65,Immortal,metal,Where Mountains Rise,"For the mighty mountains I ride 
 Through the woods beyond the snow 
 Like a fire among the stars, beyond the clouds she rise 
 There's no fire from the sun, in this dark under the moon 
 My blackened sight behold the stars, and fallen suns below 
 Darkness rage within my mind, a rage until the final call 
 To walk the mighty world am I ...Black fiend... on I rule 
 Still no fire from the sun 'there is none but the other side' 
 Awakes my soul to feel the rise, as I walk on my own 
 Mountains of ice, rise for the one 
 Might that occur toward the sky 
 Mountains of ice, shunned by moonlight 
 Now into the bare ice... 
 For the mighty mountains I ride 
 Through the woods beyond the snow 
 Like a fire among the stars, beyond the clouds she rise 
 'Bring no fire from the sun' there is none but the other side 
 Blackened sight upon the stars, and fallen suns below 
 Mountains of ice, rise for the one 
 Might that occur toward the sky 
 Mountains of ice, shunned by moonlight 
 Now into the bare ice..."
66,Immortal,metal,Blacker Of Worlds,"The dark worlds of shadows formed ages unknown 
 'Fires to rise from below' 
 Into the dark voids of the blackened beyond 
 'Cometh my visions of old' 
 The battle in my mind 'storms from within' 
 Tyrants of vengeance and war 
 Unforgotten is the old vengeful ones 
 When cold winds and ice bite like swords 
 Worlds, blacker of worlds 
 Visions to rise, as granted by the gods 
 ...From tales beyond the horizon 
 They battled the god of the sun 
 Taken to where thunder rolls 
 In time when battles begun 
 In the shadows of the rising beasts from beyond 
 I journey... my own dark vision 
 Fierce frozen vast... paling moon shine 
 To the bleak hill of the north 
 Where rising swords once stroke into fire 
 Ill gather the embattled ones 
 Darkly beyond all horizons, gathering roars of war 
 Soon call to arms, swords to meet thy doom 
 Awakened by shadows, summon the eldest of gods 
 Clangor of swords, from whom I had called"
67,Immortal,metal,Mighty Ravendark,"Frozen up north 
 Far from the sun 
 Where the heart of winter is one 
 Cold winds they blow 
 All frost and snow 
 Shadows creep in forests old 
 Unending realm awaiting fires end 
 All light from worlds disappear 
 I lurk the paths where grimly woods near 
 Frozen gates call me from there 
 Under these mountainsides rises no sun 
 Whereas the icy cold mountains are one 
 Beyond the wintery woods winds they call 
 Here under the might of its greatness I roar 
 Mighty 
 Ravendark 
 Mighty Ravendark 
 Forests climb to mountains 
 Cold winds they blow 
 Thunder and twilight and snow 
 Frost, wind and fog, snow deep and cold 
 In the realm that is hidden from all 
 Mindless voices speak through the heart of the gods 
 From the wintery woods winds they call 
 Caught in the shadows of thy ravenrealm 
 The kingdom that blackened my soul 
 Under these mountainsides rises no sun 
 Whereas the icy cold mountains are one 
 Beyond the wintery woods winds they call 
 Here under the might of its greatness I roar 
 Mighty 
 Ravendark 
 Mighty 
 Ravendark 
 Mighty Ravendark 
 Throne of the north 
 Mountains of might 
 Blashyrkh by name 
 Blashyrkh by fire 
 Towers of ice 
 Shadows of gods 
 Tales of the one 
 Frozen kingdom 
 Kingdom of north 
 Throne of them all 
 Tales of the one 
 Mountaineous sons 
 Blashyrkh by fire 
 Blashyrkh by name 
 The throne of north 
 Mighty be thy law 
 Mighty Ravendark 
 Frozen up north 
 Far from the sun 
 Where the heart of winter is one 
 Cold winds they blow 
 All frost and snow 
 Shadows creep in forests old 
 Unending realm awaiting fires end 
 All light from worlds disappear 
 I lurk the paths where grimly woods near 
 Frozen gates call me from there 
 Under these mountainsides rises no sun 
 Whereas the icy cold mountains are one 
 Beyond the wintery woods winds they call 
 Here under the might of its greatness I roar 
 Mighty 
 Ravendark 
 Mighty Ravendark"
