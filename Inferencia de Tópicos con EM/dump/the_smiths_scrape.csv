 I never did like your face

 I'm not the man you think I am 
 And Sorrow's native son 
 He will not smile for anyone 
 And pretty girls make graves 
 End of the pier, end of the bay 
 You tug my arm and say: ""Give in to lust 
 Give up to lust... 
 Oh heaven knows we'll soon be dust.."" 
 I'm not the man you think I am 
 I'm not the man you think I am 
 And Sorrow's native son

 And pretty girls make graves 
 I could have been wild and I could have been free 
 But Nature played this trick on me 
 She wants it now 
 And she will not wait 
 But she's too rough 
 And I'm too delicate 
 Then on the sand 
 Another man, he takes her hand 
 A smile lights up her stupid face 
 (And well, it would..) 
 I lost my faith in womanhood 
 I lost my faith in womanhood 
 I lost my faith..."
4,The Smiths,rock,The Hand That Rocks The Cradle,"Please don't cry 
 For the ghost and the storm outside 
 Will not invade this sacred shrine 
 Nor infiltrate your mind 
 My life down I shall lie 
 If the bogey-man should try 
 To play tricks on your sacred mind 
 To tease, torment and tantalise 
 Wavering shadows loom 
 A piano plays in an empty room 
 There'll be blood on the cleaver tonight 
 And when darkness lifts and the room is bright 
 I'll still be by your side 
 For you are all that matters 
 And I'll love you till the day I die 
 There never need be longing in your eyes 
 As long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine 
 Ceiling shadows shimmy by 
 And when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey 
 There's sadness in your beautiful eyes 
 Your untouched, unsoiled, wonderous eyes 
 My life down I shall lie 
 Should restless spirits try 
 To play tricks on your sacred mind 
 I once had a child and it saved my life 
 And I never even asked his name 
 I just looked into his wondrous eyes 
 And said: ""Never never never again"" 
 And all too soon I did return 
 Just like a moth to a flame 
 So rattle my bones all over the stones 
 I'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns 
 Oh see how words as old as sin 
 Fit me like a glove 
 I'm here and here I'll stay 
 Together we lie, together we pray 
 There never need be longing in your eyes 
 As long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine 
 As long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine 
 Climb up on my knee, sonny boy 
 Although you're only three, sonny boy 
 You're - you're mine 
 And your mother she just never knew 
 Oh, your mother ... 
 As long ... as long ... as long 
 I did my best for her 
 I did my best for her 
 As long ... as long ... as long as 
 I did my best for her 
 I did my best for her"

 For there are brighter sides to life

 As some 9-year old tough who peddles drugs

 Like love and law and poverty 
 Oh, oh

 But the rain that flattens my hair 
 Oh

 And the church who'll snatch your money

 And we gravely read the stones 
 All those people, all those lives 
 Where are they now 
 With their loves and hates 
 And passions just like mine 
 They were born and then they lived 
 And then they died 
 Seems so unfair and I want to cry 
 You say, ""Ere thrice the sun done, salutation to the dawn"" 
 And you claim these words as your own 
 But I've read well and I've heard them said 
 A hundred times, maybe less, maybe more 
 If you must write prose and poems 
 The words you use should be your own 
 Don't plagiarize or take on loan 
 There's always someone, somewhere 
 With a big nose who knows 
 And who trips you up and laughs when you fall 
 Who'll trip you up and laugh when you fall 
 You say, ""Ere long done, do, does, did"" 
 Words which could only be your own 
 And then produce the text from whence was ripped 
 Some dizzy whore, eighteen hundred and four 
 A dreaded sunny day 
 So let's go where we're happy 
 And I meet you at the cemetery gates 
 Oh, Keats and Yeats are on your side

 With Freedom and Ease 
 Combatting ignorance, dust with disease 
 As Rose counts the money in the canister

 On the bedroom floor

 Waiting to be filled

 And finally living 
 Hear my voice in your head 
 And think of me kindly 
 Do you love me

 May help to remind you 
 To forget that 
 Work Is A Four-Letter Word 
 I don't need 
 A house that's a showplace 
 I just feel 
 That we're going no place 
 While you say that 
 Work Is A Four-Letter Word 
 So change your life 
 There is so much I know 
 You can do 
 Come and see... 
 Wide-awake 
 And take all of this love 
 That is waiting for you 
 If you stay 
 I'll stay right beside you 
 And my love 
 Might help to remind you 
 To forget that 
 Work Is A Four-Letter Word 
 Oh... 
 I don't need 
 A house that's a showplace 
 I just feel 
 That we're going no place 
 While you say that 
 Work Is A Four-Letter Word 
 So change your life 
 There is so much I know 
 That you can do 
 Please come and see... 
 Wide-awake 
 And take all of this love 
 That is waiting for you"
69,The Smiths,rock,I Keep Mine Hidden,"Hate, Love and War 
 Force emotions to the fore 
 But not for me of course, of course 
 I KEEP MINE hidden 
 I KEEP MINE hidden 
 But it's so easy for you 
 Because you let yours flail 
 Into public view 
 Yellow and green, a stumbling block 
 I'm a twenty-digit combination to unlock 
 With a past where to be touched 
 Meant to be mental 
 I KEEP MINE hidden 
 The lies are so easy for you 
 Because you let yours slide 
 Into public view 
 ( 
 Use your loaf! 
 )"

 The time goes on, those minutes fly by you wanna go, but just you try, guy 
 You wanna see her, you wanna see her, oh yeah, so you wait, you wait and wait - girl donÆt come

 I want a boy for my birthday 
 That's what I've been dreaming of 
 I won't have a happy birthday 
 Without a boy to love 
 Don't want a bracelet with golden charms 
 'Cause that won't fill my empty arms

72,The Smiths,rock,Marie's The Name (His Latest Flame),"Very old friend 
 Came by today 
 As he was telling everyone in town 
 Of all the love that he'd just found 
 And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
 Talked and talked 
 And I heard him say 
 That she had the longest blackest hair 
 Prettiest green eyes anywhere 
 And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
 The last night of the fair 
 By the big wheel generator 
 A boy is stabbed 
 His money is grabbed 
 And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine 
 She is Famous 
 She is Funny 
 An engagement ring 
 Doesn't mean a thing 
 To a mind consumed by brass (money), oh 
 The last night of the fair 
 From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
 Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
 It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side) 
 From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
 Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
 A hideous trait (on her mother's side) 
 Then someone falls in love 
 Someone's beaten up 
 Someone's beaten up 
 And the senses being dulled are mine 
 And someone falls in love 
 Someone's beaten up 
 And the senses being dulled are mine 
 This is the last night of the fair 
 And the grease in the hair 
 Of a speedway operator 
 Is all a tremulous heart requires 
 A schoolgirl is denied 
 She said : ""How quickly would I die 
 If I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"" 
 This is the last night of the fair 
 And the grease in the hair 
 Of a speedway operator 
 Is all a tremulous heart requires 
 A schoolgirl is denied 
 She said : ""How quickly would I die 
 Oh, if I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"" 
 ...Oh, walk home alone 
 I might walk home alone 
 But my faith in love is still devout 
 I might walk home alone 
 But my faith in love is still devout 
 I might walk home alone 
 But my faith in love is still devout"
73,The Smiths,rock,Summer Nights,"Winter's almost gone, 
 Oh how I've waited so long 
 For summer nights. 
 When there's magic in the air 
 And I don't have a care, 
 All that matters to me 
 Is that you are here 
 On summer nights. 
 There's a little cafe 
 Where we can hear music play. 
 They keep the lights turned down low 
 It's a place where lovers go. 
 There you'll hold me tight and say 
 Our love will always be this way 
 On summer nights. 
 At the end of the day 
 We can go down to the bay 
 And together hand in hand 
 We will walk along the sand 
 On summer nights. 
 In our little cafe 
 We'll dance the night away 
 And we know our love will be 
 Always true eternally. 
 And when the moon begins to shine 
 I can see that you are mine 
 On summer nights. 
 On summer nights. 
 On summer nights."
74,The Smiths,rock,The Sha La La Song,"At last it's over, 
 I knew I could not hold him, 
 His love for freedom 
 Was far too strong. 
 But though he's gone now 
 My life is just beginning, 
 I'll soon forget him, 
 I'll soon forget him, 
 I must forget him, Lord! 
 Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la, 
 There's a brand new day beginning. 
 Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la, 
 There's a brand new love that waits for me. 
 Will I remember, 
 Will I still hear him whisper? 
 Will I still feel his 
 Lips on mine? 
 In dreams I see him, 
 Perhaps he'll stay forever 
 And all I'm wishing 
 And all I'm hoping 
 And all my longing, too. 
 Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la, 
 There's a brand new day beginning. 
 Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la, 
 There's a brand new love that waits for me. 
 He made me happy 
 And though I suffered, too, 
 There's no mistaking 
 Our love was true. 
 But such a sweet love 
 Just wasn't meant to be 
 And it's all over 
 Yes, it's all over, 
 And now it's done I'll start anew. 
 Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la, 
 There's a brand new day beginning. 
 Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la, 
 There's a brand new love beginning. 
 Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la, 
 There's a brand new day beginning. 
 Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la, 
 There's a brand new love beginning."
75,The Smiths,rock,What Do You See In Him?,"Oh, the nights are too long 
 When the questions are long 
 I tried, but I will never understand 
 What Do You See In Him? 
 What Do You See In Him? 
 Oh... 
 She's the lifeblood of me 
 As you walk hand in hand 
 And I try, and I try, and I try 
 But I will never understand 
 Oh, What Do You See In Him? 
 I ask myself: 
 What Do You See In Him? 
 Oh... 
 But she will plague you and I will be glad 
 Yes, she will plague you and I will be glad 
 Oh... 
 Oh..."
76,The Smiths,rock,What's The World?,"""Um... this song was written by... erm, erm..."" 
 What would you sell? 
 Loose glasses and suit 
 Heart and soul 
 Won't wear out 
 That's not enough! 
 I wonder what's inside 
 Fish fillet knife 
 Can cut 
 Right through my eye... 
 I'm looking for some words 
 To call my own 
 Worn-out phrases 
 And a hand-me-down 
 They'll knock me 
 Under where I stand 
 Sad on his back 
 In a corned beef pan 
 Going under 
 You can feel them pulling me down 
 To the rust inside... 
 This is the way... 
 Franken-star is born 
 Bits and pieces 
 Others have worn 
 All held together by a management glue 
 Too much glue 
 Watch the stars turn blue 
 Turn blue 
 Turn blue 
 Turn blue 
 Turn blue 
 I'm going under 
 You can feel them pulling me down 
 To the halls of rust 
 Eeh... 
 I, I, I, I, I... 
 Thankyou..."
