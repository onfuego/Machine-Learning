 Be a world child, form a circle 
 Before we all go under 
 And fade out again

 Cracked eggs, dead birds scream as they fight for life 
 I can feel death, can see its beady eyes 
 All these things into position

 I'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me 
 They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely 
 I'd show them the stars and the meaning of life 
 They'd shut me away

 Charity standing orders, on Sundays ring road supermarket 
 No killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants 
 Car wash also on Sundays 
 No longer afraid of the dark or midday shadows 
 Nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate, nothing so childish 
 At a better pace, slower and more calculated 
 No chance of escape, now self-employed 
 Concerned but powerless 
 An empowered and informed member of society 
 Pragmatism not idealism 
 Will not cry in public, less chance of illness 
 Tyres that grip in the wet, shot of baby strapped in backseat, a good memory 
 Still cries at a good film, still kisses with saliva 
 No longer empty and frantic 
 Like a cat tied to a stick that's driven into frozen winter shit

 The stuff that makes your heart go pitter-pat 
 The stuff that makes everything turn blue and green 
 She said that she preferred it like that 
 Give it up (x3) Hey!

 Well hello 
 Let me shake you by the hand 
 Just wanna say thank you 
 At least someone has got this whole thing sorted out now 
 At least someone has got the right idea 
 My head is clear 
 I can see through all the dirt now 
 My eyes are clear 
 I can put my cigarette out right now 
 All right (come on and talk about it) 
 Happy song (this is a happy song) 
 All right (come on and talk about it) 
 Happy song (this is a happy song) 
 Tell me what I'm doing when I'm burning your house down 
 Tell me what I'm doing when I let go of your plans 
 Someone's gotta know what the hell is going on now 
 Someone's gotta know the truth to all of this 
 My head is clear 
 I can see through all the dirt now 
 Her eyes are clear 
 I can put my cigarette out now

132,Radiohead,rock,I Froze Up,"""Okay, for anyone who's still listening 
 This is a song called I Froze Up 
 I did 
 What? Don't distract me."" 
 You're the light wiping out my batteries 
 You're the cream in my airport-coffees 
 I don't know why I stick with you 
 If I had a choice 
 Like lambs into the slaughter 
 Like cows to the thunderbolt 
 You're the Genie of my lamp 
 I could have been anyone 
 But one day I froze up 
 But one day I froze up 
 But one day I froze up 
 Like this... 
 Oh, little boy... 
 Little boy, little boy 
 Oh, little boy... 
 Little boy, little boy 
 If you try to strangle the skylark 
 Try to cut it up, to see how it works 
 Stalactites and stalagmites 
 Rows of never open doors 
 'Cause one day I froze up 
 'Cause one day I froze up 
 'Cause one day I froze up 
 Like this...

133,Radiohead,rock,I Want None Of This,"You can keep what you want 
 I want none of this 
 They're just bad memories 
 I don't want 
 In the sunshine 
 You can pack it all up 
 And be gone 
 And be gone 
 If it matters to you 
 You can sell it all up 
 If the price feels right 
 I won't judge 
 If you get off your knees 
 You'll be out on the breeze 
 Take a lesson from me 
 Don't get stuck on a dream"
134,Radiohead,rock,Nobody Does It Better,"Nobody does it better 
 Makes me feel sad for the rest 
 Nobody does it half as good as you 
 Baby you're the best 
 I wasn't looking but somehow you found me 
 I tried to hide from your love light 
 But like heaven above me, the spy who loved me 
 Is keeping all my secrets safe tonight 
 And nobody does it better 
 Sometimes I wish someone would 
 Nobody does it half as good as you 
 Why'd you have to be so good 
 The way that you hold me, whenever you hold me 
 There's some kind of magic inside you 
 That keeps me from running, but just keep it coming 
 How'd you learn to do the things you do 
 And nobody does it better 
 Makes me feel sad for the rest 
 Nobody does it quite the way you do 
 Baby, baby 
 Baby you're the best 
 Baby you're the best 
 Baby you're the best 
 Baby you're the best"

 He started his broken sentence,""no alarms and no surprises...""

 When I turn away she's split 
 She went 
 Nothing touches me 
 Nothing touches me now 
 Nothing touches me, man 
 No matter how you split 
 Sticks and stones can get through bones 
 So I've given up looking out of it 
 I try to make her listen 
 When I turn away she's split 
 I try to make her listen 
 When I turn away she's split 
 She went 
 Nothing touches me now 
 Nothing touches me now 
 Nothing touches me now 
 Nothing touches me now

 And I won't fall for you

 It's like a weapon, like a weapon 
 Of self defense, self defense 
 Against the present, against the present 
 The present tense 
 I won't get heavy, don't get heavy 
 Keep it light, and keep it moving 
 I am doing, no harm 
 As my world, comes crashing down 
 I am dancing, freaking out 
 Deaf, dumb, and blind 
 In you I'm lost (x2) 
 I won't turn around, while the penny drops 
 I won't stop now, I won't slack off 
 Or all this love will be in vain, o-ooh 
 Stop from falling down a mine 
 Or all this love will be in vain 
 O-ooh 
 In you I'm lost (x2)"
139,Radiohead,rock,The Rip,"As she walks in the room, 
 Scented and tall, 
 Hesitating once more. 
 And as I take on myself, 
 And the bitterness I felt, 
 Realise that love lost well. 
 White horses, 
 They will take me away, 
 And my tenderness I feel, 
 Will send the dark underneath, 
 Will I follow? 
 Through the glory of life, 
 I will scatter on the floor, 
 Disappointed and sore. 
 And in my thoughts I have bled, 
 For the riddles I've been fed, 
 Another line is over-oh. 
 White horses, 
 They will take me away, 
 And my tenderness I feel, 
 Will send the dark underneath, 
 Will I follow? 
 White horses, 
 They will take me away, 
 And my tenderness I feel, 
 Will send the dark underneath, 
 Will I follow?"

 Magnetic pull 
 Back to the other place

 To drive your stupid car 
 I find it hard 
 'Cause I never get that far 
 And you put my brain in overload

 And I cannot see your face 
 And I failed in life 
 'Cause you crushed me with your hate 
 And you put my brain in overload 
 I can't change gears 
 I cannot see the road"
143,Radiohead,rock,Tell Me Why,"Sailing heart-ships through broken harbors 
 Out on the waves in the night 
 Still the searcher must ride the dark horse 
 Racing alone in his fright. 
 Tell me why, tell me why 
 Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself, 
 When your old enough to repay but young enough to sell? 
 Tell me lies later, come and see me 
 I'll be around for a while. 
 I am lonely but you can free me 
 All in the way that you smile 
 Tell me why, tell me why 
 Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself, 
 When your old enough to repay but young enough to sell? 
 Tell me why, tell me why 
 Tell me why, tell me why"

 But I haven't made the stairs yet 
 But you know what mean girls say 
 If you haven't got it when your thirty 
 That's the way you stay 
 I can wash and clean the bedrooms 
 I can make some egg and toast 
 If you let me stay the night 
 Then I'll let you get some rest 
 We could talk awhile on the futon 
 If that's the way you want it 
 Tell me where you want me 
 Tell me where to sit 
 Where to start to build a clock 
 Yeah, I depended on you 
 I depended on you 
 To be a brilliant light yeah 
 To be a brilliant light 
 To be a brilliant light yeah 
 To be a brilliant light 
 Bring me in the church 
 On the corner of your street 
 I'll be praying for forgiveness 
 I'll be praying for some love 
 Because I haven't got a job 
 And my heart's been closed 
 You could start with the trousers 
 'Cause it's what's stopping the blood flow 
 Where to start to build a clock 
 I depended on you 
 I depended on you 
 To be a brilliant light yeah 
 To be a brilliant light 
 To be a brilliant light yeah

 I could be happy the rest of my life 
 With a cinnamon girl 
 A dreamer of pictures

 You see us together 
 Chasing the moonlight 
 My cinnamon girl 
 Ten silver saxes, a bass with a bow 
 The drummer relaxes and waits between shows 
 For his cinnamon girl 
 A dreamer of pictures 
 I run in the night 
 You see us together 
 Chasing the moonlight

 I'm gonna make it somehow 
 I need another chance

150,Radiohead,rock,What Is It That You Say,"No longer caught up, big church wall 
 Makin' some noise with a pair of drums 
 Lying your thoughts out over the sky 
 Spinning around as you gaze at the sun 
 (What is that you say?) 
 Why don't you talk to me? 
 (What don't you talk to me?) 
 What is that you say? 
 (What is that you say?) 
 Wrapping your fingers 'round my neck 
 I see the grass is still when we made our beds 
 I see the thin weed boy ride at this edge 
 I see the holy Jesus and the Pharaoh and the Venus 
 And the ghost of you and me gagged and given up for dead 
 (What is that you say?) 
 Why don't you talk to me? 
 (What don't you talk to me?) 
 What is that you say? 
 (What is that you say?) 
 Wrapping your fingers 'round my neck 
 There's something up there but I 
 Don't know what the hell it is 
 There's something up there 
 As you guessed like the sun

 Why don't you talk to me? 
 (What don't you talk to me?) 
 What is that you say?
