5,Red Hot Chili Peppers,rock,Green Heaven,"About this planet, there is something I know 
 There's a very big difference between above and below 
 A friend foe, or bro, leave your body on the floor 
 Let your spirit fly away like the soul of a crow 
 Here, above land, man has laid his plan 
 And yes, it does include the Ku Klux Klan 
 We got a government so twisted and bent 
 Bombs, tanks and guns is how our money is spent 
 We got V.D., heroin, greed and prostitution 
 Tension, aggravation, L. Ron Hubbard solution 
 Not to mention hard-core chemical pollution 
 If you think you're just away, you're in a mental institution 
 And that's a heart felt shame 
 'Cause everyone's crazy, everyone's the same 
 So, why should only Larry, Curly and Moe be to blame? 
 Time now to take you to a different place 
 Where peace lovin' whales flow through liquid outer space 
 A groovin' and a gliddin' as graceful as lace 
 A never losing touch with the ocean's embrace 
 Diviner than the dolphin, that there is none 
 'Cause dolphins just-a like to have a lot of fun 
 No one tells 'em how their life is run 
 And no one points at them with a gun 
 They have a lot of love for every living creature 
 The smile of a dolphin is a built in feature 
 They be movin' in schools but everyone's the teacher 
 Someday mister dolphin, I know I'm going to meet you 
 Back to the land of the policeman 
 Where he does whatever he says he can 
 Including hating you because you're a Jew 
 Or beating black ass, that's nothing new 
 Trigger happy cops, they just like to brawl 
 They use guns, clubs, gas, but that's not all 
 They got puke-ridden prisons and sex-sick jails 
 Fuck the poor, if you're rich you pay the bail 
 So support your police, support your local wars 
 That's the way to open economic doors 
 Why do we do it? 'Cause the president's a whore 
 We assume the position to sell the ammunition 
 What the fuck? It's the American tradition 
 Along with going fishin' apple pies in the kitchen 
 Isn't it bitchin' seeing dead men in ditches?"

 Along with six million others in this place called L.A. 
 L.A. is the place, sets my mind ablaze 
 For me, it's a race through a cotton pickin' maze 
 The town makes me jump, it's got a bunch of bad chicks 
 Well sure, it's got some chumps but I still get my kicks 
 My body loves to scrump when I lick the ripe pick 
 Like a come on a thumb 
 Poppin' hump, hump, hump, pop out 
 The action never stops, I'm as wild as can be 
 'Cause I'm shooting for the top and my best friend is Flea 
 Oom Chucka Willy knew the balls to pop 
 But he never met the Tree so he never be-bopped out hop! 
 Antwan the Swan, from the pretty fish pond 
 Was a bad mother jumper, you could tell he was strong 
 He war a cold paisley jacket and a hellified hat 
 And between his legs was a sweat young lass 
 He threw a hundred women up against the wall 
 And he swore to fear that he'd love 'em all 
 By the time he got to ninety nine, he had to stop 
 Because that's when he thought that he heard a phone 
 Last night and the night before, I heard a 
 Fop outside, then I came in doors 
 Freak out! 
 Now that I told you a little something about the Flea 
 A little something about the Tree, a little something about me 
 I can't leave you hangin' but my man Shermzy, he swings the yang, he bangs the 
 Yang 
 And now, it's time to hear him do his playin', you better be burning Sherman!

10,Red Hot Chili Peppers,rock,What It Is,"Give it up to this time full of strife 
 Get down, you might be fucking with the song of life 
 Extend your deeper senses, there will be no fight 
 At the never ending ocean of perfect insights 
 'Round your molecule beam with a halo of light 
 The animated aura will give delight 
 Soon, your every single worry will be out of sight 
 With the power of It, we are about to astound 
 All your preconceptions, they will come unbound 
 Listen very close, my inner voice expounds 
 We are the human race and we groove to the sound 
 Yes, we deliver the truth to our musical birth 
 A soul shocking sound with electrify the earth 
 People have to know that it's not about money 
 Cash is not the way to make your life sunny 
 There is no need if you got the soul seed 
 Love, life and peace, it can only begin 
 When you know in your heart that the change is within 
 Love all your brothers and love all your sisters 
 Love all the missus and love all the misses 
 And don't be shy when you're sharing your kisses 
 Greed, jealousy gets boos and hisses 
 What it is, what it is, so much to be found 
 What it is, what it is, groove down to the sounds 
 What it is, what it is, what it is in a song 
 What it is, what it is, you can do no wrong 
 Balance your life with the right kind of foods 
 To eat a sad cow is to eat another you 
 Well, that's an unfair rap, it's unforgivably rude 
 It'll put your karma in the worst of moods 
 Someone's drinking booze and taking too many ludes 
 'Cause when you cop, don't you cop an attitude 
 And that's an ugly thing, it's not the real you 
 So please y'all, take some sound advice 
 Be yourself, clear your mind, make a sacrifice 
 The always sober you is especially nice 
 Don't loot, don't shout, give comet the boot 
 I love it kickin' back and playin' my bamboo flute 
 Refuse to fight wars for political whores 
 Unsurpassed peace lines the salt water shores 
 It is my notion that the perfect peace potion 
 Can be found in the wake of the green sea ocean 
 The long rocky swells of the mighty blue ocean 
 Is the cradle of peace, it's the perfect peace potion 
 There you will find it, with sweet sea creatures 
 The smile of a dolphin is a built-in feature 
 We will learn much peace will the whale as your teacher 
 Good morning class, how very nice to meet you 
 What it is, what it is, so much to be found 
 What it is, what it is, groove down to the sounds 
 What it is, what it is, what it is in a song 
 What it is, what it is, you can do no wrong 
 Open up your hearts to the planets; to the stars 
 With your spirit take a trip from Venus to Mars 
 You know, Einstein did while Hitler hid 
 Now, Albert lives forever in every single kid 
 But, with Adolph Hitler, we are permanently rid 
 Picasso, Mister Dali and my man, Jimi Hendrix 
 These cool brothers make the world go 'round 
 Yeah, they do it with art, and Jimi did it with sound 
 But, by all these men, it was found 
 Each and every person can be just as renowned 
 Don't let the world's racist creeds give your pretty face a frown 
 Stand up for equal rights, I mean buckle down 
 Go spread the word from town to town 
 We are the human race and we groove to the sounds 
 Now that you've heard what it is in a song 
 From here on in, you can do no wrong"

 Givin' bush baby, bush baby birth 
 The baby was a boy 
 But I think what stunned her 
 Is that this bare breasted baby 
 Was a baby boy, boy, boy, boy wonder 
 Crackin' from his thumb bone 
 Came thelonious thunder 
 Fill the sky with hellfire 
 From way down, down, down under 
 I am a jungle man 
 I am a jungle man 
 I am a jungle man 
 I get all the bush I can 
 Erupting from the ground 
 In Hollywood he glowed 
 His jungle turned to concrete 
 His funk bone, bone, bone, bone to stone 
 Like a full blown volcano 
 I must let it be known 
 That through this boy's vein 
 Atomic lava blood flows and flows 
 His soul shocking sounds 
 They make the mountains moan 
 This boy's become a man 
 It's time to take, take, take 
 Take the throne

 Where the buffalo roam 
 And the death of a race is a game 
 Where seldom is heard

 From the white trash 
 Who killed as they came 
 Though these words dig deep 
 They offer no relief 
 God save the queen 
 I am an Indian chief 
 There is a secret I keep 
 It's called the talking leaf 
 And you better believe 
 That he speaks his beliefs 
 Like a rock that bleeds 
 A sea of grief 
 My talking leaf speaks of 
 A wounded knee creek 
 American ghost dance... 
 A new man who is with old ways 
 He walks the streets of life 
 But he's in chains 
 I'm alive he cried 
 I can feel the flame 
 Burning red inside 
 I am an Indian brave 
 There is a memory 
 That lives in my blood 
 Of the brand you laid 
 On all you touched 
 But the burning flame 
 Turns to burning pain 
 Genuine genocide 
 And that's truly insane 
 So like a wild hurricane 
 I will dance on the grave 
 Of my race that died 
 When it should have been saved

 In the class she's taking notes 
 Just how deep, deep is my throat 
 Mother Mary, don't you know 
 She's got eyes like Marilyn Monroe 
 Catholic school girls rule... 
 From the cross she's raised her head 
 This is what the sister said 
 Give no love until you're wed 
 Live no life until you're dead 
 The good book says we must suppress 
 The good book says we must confess 
 But who cares what the good book says 
 'Cause now she's taking off her dress 
 Catholic school girls rule... 
 Lead us into temptation 
 We are pure divine creation 
 Talkin' about my generation 
 Injected with the seed of immaculation

22,Red Hot Chili Peppers,rock,Sex Rap,"Time to swing a little melody 
 To make you all feel something sexually 
 And now we're gonna get it on in the groove 
 The groove that makes those smooth hips move 
 We are pumpin' that drivin' bad rhythm 
 To make those pretty little pussy lips schism 
 Kissum kissum kissum 
 In the mind is one design 
 To make you feel fine 
 Suckin' on mine with a 69 
 I'm inclined to fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck your brains out 
 For the moment, come on now, make her shout 
 Pump that leman till it pouts 
 Open your legs to the sensual sound 
 With the beauty of the beat on your pretty wet mound 
 I can tell you're like a horny bloodhound 
 Feel the bass, hug the ground 
 Just drop your knees and come unbound 
 And now you make your mouth to get on down 
 Our lust for notes will boil your blood 
 When they slither and slide on under your hood 
 Makin' me shoot my power packed pud 
 Like a wild lady lovin' a viable stud 
 Because of what is know as a juicy wet pud 
 Gettin' it gettin' it gettin' it good 
 In my head, as a hellified hum 
 I take to rubbin' her on the bum 
 Adjust the lips some on the tongue 
 With my thumb I strum her plum 
 Start to make her orgasm 
 Tastes a little bit like, ooh, how rum 
 Well I like to make her cum 
 To the rhythm of the drums 
 Make cum, make cum, cum"

24,Red Hot Chili Peppers,rock,Yertle The Turtle,"On the far away island of Salamasond 
 Yertle the turtle 
 Was king of the pond 
 A nice little pond 
 It was clean it was neat 
 The water was warm 
 There was plenty to eat 
 Until one day 
 The king of them all 
 Decided the kingdom 
 He ruled was too small 
 I'm a ruler of all that I see 
 But I don't see enough 
 And that's the trouble with me 
 With this stone for a throne 
 I am too low down 
 I cannot look down 
 Upon the places beyond 
 So Yertle the turtle king 
 Lifted his hand 
 And Yertle the turtle king 
 Gave a command 
 He ordered all the turtles 
 Onto one another's back 
 He piled them high 
 Into a ten turtle stack 
 I'm Yertle the turtle 
 The things I now rule 
 I'm king of a cow 
 I'm king of a mule 
 Then down from below 
 In the great turtle stack 
 Came a burp from a plain 
 Little turtle named Mack 
 Just part of the throne 
 This burpin' little turtle 
 Looked up and said ""I beg 
 Your pardon king Yertle"" 
 I've pains in my back 
 My shoulders and my knees 
 How long must we stand 
 Here your majesty 
 ""Silence!"" the king of the 
 Turtles barked back 
 To the bad burpin' 
 Little turtle named Mack 
 I'm Yertle the turtle 
 Oh marvelous me 
 For I am ruler of all that I see 
 Yertle, Yertle the turtle... 
 Yertle, Yertle the turtle..."

 Well I'm a millionaire too, but not like you 
 As far as I'm concerned, I got a job to do 
 I've got to pave the way, I've got to save the day 
 I've got to make it better, I've got to say 
 You and I, we're millionaires 
 But we're a million miles away from the saint who stares 
 Upon the millions who die, every day of the week 
 Just because they can't get enough to eat 
 While we the rich dine on all these feasts 
 And everything's fine, yeah peaches and creme 
 But it just isn't something you've got to realize 
 There's something wrong, we've got to open our eyes 
 When the world cries, we just can't hide 
 We've got a job to do, we've got to save some lives 
 We're millionaires

 Hey hey Mr. Millionaire 
 Twice as nice when you share 
 Hey hey Mr. Millionaire

 I'm a millionaire, and I got something to say 
 I got a million more that'll take me away

 As far as I'm concerned, why that's okay 
 Well I'm a millionaire too, all I know that is true 
 Is that I've got more cash than I can use 
 I want anything that I can have 
 But I don't need nothin' and I never have 
 Each damn day my heart's set far 
 But I'll be okay, 'cause I don't starve 
 Kids from the street the losing their emotion 
 So damn snobby, so out of touch 
 With two hungry people who die as they stare 
 At the city at night, you know it gives to share 
 So listen up, you millionaires 
 Every woman, every man, help all you can 
 All races unite, and I will now concern 
 To the type of problem that helps us learn 
 We're millionaires

26,Red Hot Chili Peppers,rock,Fight Like A Brave,"All you slingers and fiends 
 Hide behind your rocks 
 Put down your gloves 
 I'm not here to box 
 This is no showdown 
 So throw down your guns 
 You see it doesn't matter 
 Where you come from 
 You could be from Park Ave 
 Or from a park bench 
 You could be a politician 
 Or a bitchy princess 
 But if you're lookin' for a fist 
 And you're lookin' to unite 
 Put your knuckleheads together 
 Make a fist and fight 
 Not to your death 
 And not to your grave 
 I'm talkin' bout that freedom 
 Fight like a brave 
 Fight like a brave - don't be a slave 
 No one can tell you you've got to be afraid 
 If you're sick-a-sick 'n' tired 
 Of being sick and tired 
 If you're sick of all the bullshit 
 And you're sick of all the lies 
 It's better late than never 
 To set-a-set it straight 
 You know the lie is dead 
 So give yourself a break 
 Get it through your head 
 And get it off your chest 
 Get it out your arm 
 Because it's time to start fresh 
 You want to stop dying 
 The life you could be livin' 
 I'm here to tell a story 
 But I'm also here to listen 
 No I'm not your preacher 
 And I'm not your physician 
 I'm just trying to reach you 
 I'm a rebel with a mission 
 Fight like a brave - don't be a slave 
 No one can tell you you've got to be afraid 
 Fight like a brave - don't be a slave 
 No one can tell you you've got to be afraid 
 You say you're running and you're running 
 And you're running afraid 
 You say you ran across the planet 
 But you couldn't get away 
 The fire in your brain 
 Was driving you insane 
 You were looking for a day 
 In a life that never came 
 So don't tell me that 
 I've got to take a number 
 'Cause I've been to that doctor 
 And believe me that's a bummer 
 He's one of a kind 
 Convention of the mind 
 And don't forget to mention 
 That it doesn't cost a dime 
 Come as you like 
 And leave any time 
 And one more thing 
 You know it doesn't have to rhyme 
 Fight like a brave - don't be a slave 
 No one can tell you you've got to be afraid 
 Fight like a brave - don't be a slave 
 No one can tell you you've got to be afraid 
 Fight like a brave - don't be a slave 
 No one can tell you you've got to be afraid 
 Fight like a brave - don't be a slave

 Spinning' down from the clouds 
 Like a tornado 
 Spinnin' out of control 
 Like a psychedelic soul 
 With a rhythm hittin' harder

 Play the lickity split finger licking licks

 And all you nitty gritty hick

 Make you wanna dip your dipple 
 Make you wanna soak your hickory stick 
 That's right 
 Because my man has a grip on it 
 And I do mean on it 
 Which brings to mind 
 A very sinister minister kind of guy 
 A man named Little Richard 
 Who was born to make them bitches stir 
 That's right, he'll make the sweet substance drip 
 From the middle of your hillbilly lips 
 And like the farmer milks his cow 
 The Howling Wolf will howl 
 And since times does allow 
 You all can take me to your backwoods now

 He spoke to me in symphony 
 From freedom's peace beneath the sea 
 He looked to me, eyes full of love 
 Said, ""Yes, we live behind the sun"" 
 Behind the sun 
 Behind the sun 
 Behind the sun 
 The sun goes up 
 And the sun gets down 
 But like the heart of the sun 
 My heart continues to pound 
 Behind the sun 
 Now while I shower in the rain 
 I watch my dolphin swim away 
 The one who listens to the surf 
 Can feel the pulse beat of the earth 
 And like my dolphin swims so free 
 The sun does swim into the sea 
 Behind the sun 
 Behind the sun 
 Behind the sun 
 Behind the sun 
 An island flying through the sky 
 One day your son might ask you why 
 And if your son should be a girl 
 She too might ask you of this world 
 The sun shines sweet upon your beach 
 And yes, my dolphin loves to teach 
 Behind the sun 
 Behind the sun 
 Behind the sun 
 The sun goes up 
 And the sun gets down 
 But like the heart of the sun 
 My heart continues to pound 
 Behind the sun"

 Knucklehead suckers better duck

 Scott stops, pops and drops it in 
 On his way back, gets a little skin 
 From the hand of a man named A.C. Green

 Lakers are the team that I watch on the telly 
 'Cause they've got more moves 
 Than a bowl of jelly 
 The Buck stops here - pops - then cheers 
 A roar through the forum 
 That deafens my ears

 Sits in a throne 
 Not for the records that he holds 
 But for being bald and bold

 Pain's part of life don't hide behind your false pride 
 It's a lie, your lie 
 Don't slip away and don't forget 
 I'll give you more than you can get 
 It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself 
 Come to me 
 If you see me getting mighty 
 If you see me getting high 
 Knock me down 
 I'm not bigger than life 
 I'm tired of being untouchable 
 I'm not above the love 
 I'm part of you and you're part of me 
 Why did you go away 
 Too late to tell you how I feel 
 I want you back but I get real 
 Can you hear my falling tears 
 Making rain where you lay 
 Finding what you're looking for 
 Can end up being such a bore 
 I pray for you most every day 
 My love's with you now fly away 
 If you see me getting mighty 
 If you see me getting high 
 Knock me down 
 I'm not bigger than life 
 If you see me getting mighty 
 If you see me getting high 
 Knock me down 
 I'm not bigger than life 
 It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself..."
53,Red Hot Chili Peppers,rock,Castles Made Of Sand,"Down the street you can hear her scream, ""You're a disgrace"" 
 As she slams the door in his drunken face 
 And now he stands outside 
 And all the neighbours start to gossip and drool 
 He cries, ""Oh girl, you must be mad 
 What happened to the sweet love you and me had?"" 
 Against the door he leans and starts a scene 
 And his tears fall and burn the garden green 
 And so castles made of sand 
 Fall in the sea eventually 
 There's a little Indian brave who before he was ten 
 Played war games in the woods with his Indian friends 
 And he built a dream that when he grew up 
 He would be a fearless warrior Indian chief 
 Many moons passed and the dream grew strong until tomorrow 
 He would sing his first war song 
 And fight his first battle but something went wrong 
 Surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night 
 And so castles made of sand 
 Melts into the sea eventually 
 There was a young girl whose heart was a frown 
 Because she was crippled for life and couldn't speak a sound 
 And she wished and prayed she would stop living 
 So she decided to die 
 She drew her wheelchair to the edge of the shore 
 And to her legs she smiled, ""You won't hurt me no more"" 
 But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say 
 ""Look, a golden winged ship is passing my way"" 
 And it really didn't have to stop 
 It just kept on going 
 And so castles made of sand 
 Slips into the sea eventually"
54,Red Hot Chili Peppers,rock,Crosstown Traffic,"You jump in front of my car when you 
 You know all the time that 
 Ninety miles an hour, girl, is the speed I drive 
 You tell me it's all right, you don't mind a little pain 
 You say you just want me to take you for a ride 
 You're just like crosstown traffic 
 So hard to get through to you 
 Crosstown traffic 
 I don't need to run over you 
 Crosstown traffic 
 All you do is slow me down 
 And I'm tryin' to get on the other side of town 
 I'm not the only soul who's accused of hit and run 
 Tire tracks all across your back 
 I can see you had your fun 
 But darlin', can't you see my signals turn from green to red 
 And with you I can see a traffic jam straight up ahead 
 You're just like crosstown traffic 
 So hard to get through to you 
 Crosstown traffic 
 I don't need to run over you 
 Crosstown traffic 
 All you do is slow me down 
 And I got better things on the other side of town"
55,Red Hot Chili Peppers,rock,The Power Of Equality,"Swing! 
 I've got a soul that cannot sleep 
 At night when something just ain't right, yo 
 Blood red but without sight 
 Exploding egos in the night 
 Mix like sticks of dynamite 
 Red, black or white, this is my fight 
 Come on, courage, let's be heard 
 Turn feelings into words 
 American equality has always been sour 
 An attitude I would like to devour 
 My name is peace, this is my hour 
 Can I get just a little bit of power? 
 The power of equality 
 Is not yet what it ought to be 
 (ought to be) 
 It fills me up like a hollow tree 
 (hollow tree) 
 The power of equality 
 Right or wrong, my song is strong 
 You don't like it, get along 
 Say what I want, do what I can 
 Death to the message of the Ku Klux Klan 
 I don't buy supremacy 
 A media chief, you menace me 
 The people, you say, cause all the crime 
 Wake up, motherfucker, and smell the slime 
 Blackest anger, whitest fear 
 Can you hear me? Am I clear? 
 My name is peace, this is my hour 
 Can I get just a little bit of power? 
 The power of equality 
 Is not yet what it ought to be 
 (ought to be) 
 It fills me up like a hollow tree 
 (hollow tree) 
 The power of equality 
 I've got tapes, I've got CDs 
 I've got my 
 Public Enemy 
 My lily-white ass is tickled pink 
 When I listen to the music that makes me think 
 Not another motherfucking politician 
 Doing nothing but something for his own ambition 
 Never touch the sound we make 
 Soul-sacred love, vows that we take 
 To create straight what is true 
 Yo, he's with me and what I do 
 My name is peace, this is my hour 
 Can I get just a little bit of power? 
 The power of equality 
 Is not yet what it ought to be 
 (ought to be) 
 It fills me up like a hollow tree 
 (hollow tree) 
 The power of equality 
 Madder than a motherfucker, lick my finger 
 Can't forget 'cause the memory lingers 
 Count 'em off quick, little piccadilly sickness 
 Take me to the hick, oh, eat my thickness 
 I've got a welt from the Bible belt 
 Dealing with the hand that I've been dealt 
 Sitting in the grip of a killing fist 
 Giving up blood just to exist 
 Rub me wrong and I get pissed 
 No, I cannot get to this 
 People in pain, I do not dig it 
 Change of brain for Mr. Bigot 
 Little brother, do you hear me? 
 Have a heart, oh, come get near me 
 Misery is not my friend 
 But I'll break before I bend 
 What I see is insanity 
 Whatever happened to humanity? 
 Whatever happened to humanity? 
 Whatever happened to humanity?"

 Rob another bank, he's a sock-'em-in-the-eye guy

 Look him in the eye, he's not my kinda guy 
 Never wanna be confusion proof 
 Pudding's sweet but too aloof 
 Orange-eye girl with a backslide dew said 
 ""Yo homie, who you talking to?"" 
 A backed up paddywagon, mackin' on a cat's ass 
 One uppercut to the cold, upper middle class 
 Born to storm on boredom's face 
 And a little lust to the funky-ass Flea bass 
 Most in the race just lose their grace 
 The blackest hole in all of space 
 Crooked as a hooker, now suck my thumb 
 Anybody wanna come get some?

 Funky motherfuckers will not be told to go 
 If you have to ask, you'll never know 
 Funky motherfuckers will not be told to go (oh woh woh) 
 Don't ask me why I'm flying so high 
 Mr. Bubble meets Superfly in my third eye 
 Searching for a soul bride, she's my freakette 
 Soak it up inside, deeper than a secret 
 Much more than meets the eye 
 To the funk, I fall into my new ride 
 My hand, my hand 
 Magic on the one is a medicine man 
 Thinking of a few taboos that I ought to kill 
 Dancing on their face like a stage in vaudeville 
 I feel so good, can't be understood 
 Booty of a hoodlum, rocking my red hood 
 If you have to ask, you'll never know 
 Funky motherfuckers will not be told to go 
 If you have to ask, you'll never know 
 Funky motherfuckers will not be told to go (oh woh woh)"

 I wanna be in New Orleans 
 Oh good brother, just when I thought 
 That I had seen it all 
 My eyes popped out, my dick got hard 
 And I dropped my jaw 
 I saw a bird walking down the block 
 Name Apache Rose Peacock 
 I could not speak, I was in shock 
 I told my knees to please not knock 
 Yes, my favorite place to be 
 Is not a land called Honalee 
 Mentally or physically 
 I wanna be in New Orleans 
 A little boy came along 
 Name of Louis Armstrong 
 Said that girl who left me silly 
 She liked the looks of me and my willy 
 So I found her in the quarter 
 Good God, how I adored her 
 Oh, she made me feel so cozy 
 When she told me I could call her Rosey 
 I kiss your hair, your skin so bare 
 I'll take you with me, girl, anywhere 
 You fare well in stormy weather 
 I never met a girl that I like better 
 Twinkle twinkle little star 
 Shining down on my blue car 
 Driving down the boulevard 
 She was soft and I was hard 
 Apache Rose gotta rocking peacock 
 Hottest ass on the goddamn block 
 Rocking to the beat of the funky-ass Meters 
 She has one of those built-in heaters 
 I kiss your hair, your skin so bare 
 I'll take you with me, girl, anywhere 
 You fare well in stormy weather 
 I never met a girl that I like better 
 Voodoo gurus casting their spells 
 Cockatoo drag queens shaking their bells 
 Silver sound escapes the trumpet 
 Watch your leg, someone might hump it 
 Chicken strut your butt, let's rock 
 Getting it on under your frock 
 Flowing like a flame all through the night 
 My girl's insane but it's all right 
 Yes, my favorite place to be 
 Is not a land called Honalee 
 Mentally or physically 
 I wanna be in New Orleans"

 Before the wind, before the snow 
 Lived a man, lived a man I know 
 Lived a freak of nature named Sir Psycho 
 Sir Psycho Sexy, that is me 
 Sometimes, I find I need to scream, ah 
 He's a freak of nature but we love him so 
 He's a freak of nature but we let him go 
 Deep inside the Garden of Eden 
 Standing there with my hard-on bleeding 
 There's a devil in my dick and some demons in my semen 
 Good God no, that would be treason 
 Believe me, Eve, she gave me good reason 
 Booty, looking too good not to be squeezing 
 Creamy beaver, hotter than a fever 
 I'm a giving 'cause she's the receiver 
 I won't and I don't hang up until I please her 
 Making her feel like an over-achiever 
 I take it away for a minute, just to tease her 
 Then I give it back a little bit deeper 
 Sir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yeah 
 He's the man that I met one time 
 Sir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yeah 
 He's the man that left me blind

 He's a freak of nature but we love him so 
 He's a freak of nature but we let him go 
 I got stopped by a lady cop in my automobile 
 She said ""get out and spread your legs"" 
 And then she tried to cop a feel 
 That cop, she was all dressed in blue 
 Was she pretty? Boy, I'm telling you 
 She stuck my butt with her big black stick 
 I said ""what's up? now, suck my dick"" 
 Like a ram, getting ready to jam the lamb 
 She whimpered just a little when she felt my hand 
 On her crotch, so very warm 
 I could feel her getting wet through her uniform 
 Propping her up on the black and white 
 Unzipped and slipped, Ooh, that's tight 
 I swatted her like no S.W.A.T. team can 
 Turned a cherry pie right into jam 
 Sir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yeah 
 I'm the man that you met one time

 Hello, young woman that I love 
 Pretty, punk-rock mamma that I'm thinking of 
 Hold me naked, if you will 
 In your arms, in your legs, in your pussy, I'd kill 
 To be with you 
 To kiss with you 
 I do miss you 
 I love you 
 Lay me down, lay me down, lay me down ...lay me down 
 Lay me down, lay me down, lay me down ...lay me down 
 Descending waves of graceful pleasure 
 For your love there is no measure 
 Her curves they bend with subtle splendor 
 Now I lay me down to sleep 
 I pray the funk will make me freak 
 If I should die before I waked 
 Allow me, Lord, to rock out naked 
 Bored by the ordinary time to take a trip 
 Calling up a little girl with a bull whip 
 Lickety-split, go snap-snap 
 Girl getting off all in my lap 
 The tallest tree, the sweetest sap 
 Blowing my ass right off the map 
 Ooh and it's nice out here 
 I think I'll stay for a while"

75,Red Hot Chili Peppers,rock,Deep Kick,"It started when we were little kids 
 Free spirits but already tormented 
 By our own hands given to us by our parents 
 We got together and wrote on desks 
 And slept in laundry rooms near snowy mountains 
 And slipped through whatever cracks 
 We can find minds altered 
 We didn't falter in portraying hysterical 
 And tragic characters 
 In a smog filled universe 
 We loved the dirty city 
 And the journeys away 
 From it we had not yet been 
 Or seen our friends selves 
 Chase tails round and round in 
 A downward spiral leaving a trail 
 Of irretrievable vital life juice 
 Behind still the brothers blood 
 Comrades partner family 
 Cuzz was impenetrable 
 And we lived inside it laughing 
 With no clothes and everything 
 Experimental till death was upon us 
 In our face mortality 
 And lots of things seemed futile 
 Then but love and music can save us 
 And did while the giant grey monster grew 
 More poisoned and volatile around us 
 And jaws clamping down 
 And spewing ugly shit around 
 Nothing is the same so we keep moving 
 We keep moving. 
 Went off and off and got some hair cuts 
 Lookin' wild and got all drugged up 
 Hopped a train into the night 
 Got a ride with a transvestite 
 Two boys in San Francisco 
 Two boys in San Francisco 
 Blasted off in a Bart bathroom 
 Those coppers woke us up 
 Mothersfuckers woke us up 
 Two young brothers on a hover craft 
 Telepathetic love and bellylaughs 
 Storm the stage of Universal 
 Slim shine talk boy go subversal 
 Papa's proud and so he sent us 
 Pounding hearts full and relentless 
 Two boys in London, England 
 Two boys in London, England 
 Climbing out of hostel windows 
 Wearing gear so out but in though 
 Come on kind and do the no no 
 Two young brothers on a hovercraft 
 Telepathics love and belly laughs 
 We went to Fairfax High School 
 Jumped off buildings into their pools 
 We'd sit down and grease at Canters 
 Run like hell they can't catch us 
 Two boys in L.A. proper 
 Two boys in L.A. proper 
 Stealin' anything that we could 
 Gotta sneak into the Starwood 
 Gotta peak into the deep good 
 I remember ten years ago 
 In Hollywood we did some good 
 And we did some real bad stuff 
 But the Butthole Surfers 
 Always said it's better to regret 
 Something you did than something you didn't do 
 We were young and we were looking, looking for the deep kick... 
 Seen 'em come seen 'em go"

 I feel the question of your loneliness 
 Confide, 'cause I'll be on your side

 You know I will

 Alone and desperate on the prison phone 
 They want to give her seven years 
 For being sad 
 I love all of you 
 Hurt by the cold 
 So hard and lonely too 
 When you don't know yourself 
 My friends are so distressed 
 And standing on the brink of emptiness 
 No words I know of to express 
 This emptiness 
 I love all of you 
 Hurt by the cold 
 So hard and lonely too 
 When you don't know yourself 
 Imagine me 
 Taught by tragedy 
 Release 
 Is peace 
 I heard a little girl 
 And what she said was something beautiful 
 To give your love no matter what 
 Is what she said 
 I love all of you 
 Hurt by the cold 
 So hard and lonely too 
 When you don't know yourself"

 Checkmated by frustration now 
 Need to be cut loose

 A sullen cost

 Open wide

 Do me now

 You could do it in a zone 
 You could do it in desert 
 You could do the unknown

 So fly - you gotta wonder why 
 The stingrays must be fat this year 
 I'm moving slow in my lowest gear 
 The digirido original man with a dream 
 I believe the Aborigine 
 On a walkabout 
 You could do it with a shuffle 
 You could do it with a stroll 
 You could do it with a stride 
 You could do the unknown 
 On a walkabout 
 A walk could cure most all my blues 
 Bare feet or in my two shoes

 From your loving stream

 Fuck the legal greed 
 Fuck the nothing scene 
 See the family

 Let's get off in my backyard 
 Where the desert wind 
 Will wash our skin

 A dance with heaven's devils or

 Get on my throne 
 Slay my shame 
 Slay my shame 
 Let's get gentle 
 Let's get pissed 
 Get your knickers in a twist 
 Cause the angel and the devil kiss 
 They fell in love 
 Some seem dirty 
 Some stay clean 
 Something from a madman's dream 
 Am I really what I seem? 
 Rising to my head like cream 
 It feels so strange 
 The water's falling clear 
 Interiors deceive I fear

 Staying high and dry's more trouble than its worth in the sun

 Once when I was in your favor 
 This kiss from a mess

 Free yourself

 This stands for all of them 
 Just play at any tempo 
 Going mad and going mental 
 All balm, said no

 The blood of scorpios and nine 
 Like the fear that's in eyes of every doe 
 Say it now cause John and Jane would like to know 
 Is it safe inside your head 
 Songs to serenade the dead 
 All along I said I know no enemies 
 Mix it up until there are no pedigrees 
 Over the laws of light 
 Over the moon by midnight 
 Let's do it all this time 
 Into the shadow show and 
 Enter the rolling tide 
 Over the ocean so wide 
 Let's do it all this time 
 Everyone wishing well we go"

 Time to make this clean decision 
 Master waits for its collision now

 It's a repeat and it's getting old 
 Throw away your television 
 Make a break, big intermission 
 Recreate your super vision now 
 It's a repeat of a story told 
 It's a repeat and it's getting old 
 Renegades with fancy gauges 
 Slay the plague, for it's contagious 
 Pull the plug and take the stages 
 Throw away your television now 
 Oi, oi, oi 
 Throw away your television 
 Take the noose off your ambition 
 Reinvent your intuition now

 Renegades with fancy gauges 
 Slay the plague, for it's contagious 
 Pull the plug and take the stages

 Tell me where you want me 
 This is my time, this is my tear 
 Coming on strong, Baudelaire 
 Seems to me like all the world gets high, when you take a dare 
 Let it rise before you 
 This is my crime 
 All in all and I'm, loving every rise and fall 
 The sun will make and I will take, breath to be sure of this 
 In the end and then, all will be forgiven 
 When surrender rises high and I, gave what I came to give 
 Say it now because you never know 
 Devil may cry, devil may care 
 Distiller's got a scream and now I know just why, when she's moving air 
 Can you feel the voltage 
 This is my time 
 California skies got room to spare 
 This is my time 
 All in all and I'm, loving every rise and fall 
 The sun will make and I will take, breath to be sure of this 
 In the end and then, all will be forgiven 
 When surrender rises high and I, gave what I came to give 
 Say it now because you never know 
 Oh, never know 
 Take it outside, take it out there

 In the final moment 
 This is my time

 The bicycle is a good invention 
 Sitting there in a silent movie 
 Beside the only girl who really ever knew me 
 Happy days but sadder face 
 And heaven knows I'm on the case 
 How could I forget to mention the bicycle? 
 Somebody told the world 
 The beauty of your verse 
 My girl I heard it first 
 The beauty of your verse 
 A sticky finger and a wicked taste 
 Got a lot of love and a lyrical case 
 Be sure to write it in your book 
 I promise not to look 
 I wanna smell your sunny face 
 Funny place but it's never awaste 
 I'd hop this fence to make amends 
 I hope this movie never ends 
 How could I forget to mention 
 The bicycle is a good invention 
 Make it up and making you my business 
 A funny buttercup gotta live for forgiveness 
 Happy days but sadder face 
 And heaven knows I'm on the case 
 How could I forget to mention the bicycle?

 Fascinated by the face of time 
 What time 
 I got it to give and now we're gonna make some time 
 Ultra-fine and altruistic 
 Can I spy into the mystic 
 System down for infiltration 
 Open mind free of frustration

 To a safe place 
 And arriving 
 As I retraced 
 Yell into a telescope 
 Aim it at the star of hope

 Fascinated by the face of time 
 What time 
 I got it to give and now we're gonna make some time 
 All over the yonder 
 The smell of blood and thunder 
 I'm connected by the lightning rod 
 Giving the beauty to it

 Fire from the other side out there

 Technology of a prayer 
 Scientist to the prism of faith

 A million miles of water that are flowing deep beneath this ground 
 Now, I found you right here 
 A million miles of water

 Just because you happen to have a bomb doesn't mean you light the fuse 
 I know that my girl, big lie 
 Four years in and you never even said goodbye 
 Hey girl, what sound

 Now, I found you right here 
 A million miles of water dear 
 Hey girl, what sound 
 I want you to remember that some times we have to go without 
 Now I found it right here 
 I want you to remember dear 
 We were two of a funny kind 
 So damn blind but now we got to nevermind 
 I know that this is the end, we tried 
 So hard, but now I got to lose a friend

 She said, ""my man, you know, it's time to get your fingers wet"" 
 You hustle faster when you can't afford a cigarette 
 The last I heard from you, you were screaming, ""handle it"" 
 Knock the world right off its feet and straight onto its head 
 The book of love will long be laughing after you are dead 
 Fascinated by the look of you and what was said 
 Make a play for all the brightest minds, and light will shed

 To get your head shrunk is what I recommend 
 It's in your bloodline, a perfect Frankenstein 
 Out on that lone pine, I'm gonna make you mine 
 It's understood, you wrap your voodoo right around my neck 
 You've got some glitter on your kitty at the discotheque 
 I put my lovin' in your oven, not a head to check 
 The last I heard from you, you were screaming, ""resurrect""

 Watching us in your garage 
 Big girl, you ate the neighbor 
 The nova is over 
 Wake up and play 
 By the radio 
 Make room for Clara's bare feet

 Tick tock, they're waiting for the meteor 
 This clock is opening another door

 Signing off and winding down

 By the mission bell 
 Chase lizards, bark at donkeys

 And let the trumpets blow 
 Our girl is gone

 The one who can't afford to face her image is restored to grace 
 Disappeared, no trace 
 Musky tear, suitcase 
 The downturn, brave little burn cub 
 Bear careless, turnip snare rampages 
 Pitch color pages 
 Down and out, but not in Vegas 
 Disembarks and disengages 
 No loft 
 Sweet pink canary cages 
 Plummet pop, dew skin, fortitude for the sniffing black noses 
 That snort and allude to dangling trinkets 
 That mimic the dirt cough go drink it's 
 It's for you 
 Blue battered naval down slip kisses 
 Delivered by duck muscles and bottle-nosed grifters 
 Arrive in time to catch the late show 
 It's a beehive barrel race 
 A she-hive stare and chase 
 Wasted feature who tried and failed to reach her 
 Embossed beneath a box in the closet that's lost 
 The kind that you find when you mind your own business 
 Shiv sister to the quickness before it blisters 
 Into the new morning milk blanket 
 Your ilk is funny to the turnstyle touch bunny 
 Whose bouquet set a course for bloom without decay 
 Get your broom and sweep echoes of yesterday's fallen freckles away"

 The spider and the snake 
 A trip without pause when 
 I saw my mistake 
 'Cause we all need something to do 
 A certain something, that's true

 Upon the wire the flayer is gonna satisfy her

 My breathless defender 
 Step froward and steal this

 Comin' down I gotta catch the gravity 
 Even though we disagree 
 Give a kiss 'cause life could be the death of me 
 Acrobatic the static is getting to dramatic 
 Comin' down with the system 
 We'll get it systematic 
 Fascilitatin' the maiden my love is circulating 
 Rejuvenating the fading but never dilating 
 My love is forever 
 My love it can feel this

 Step froward and steal this 
 Mercy, mercy, mercy me 
 Lovin' on the color of an Emily 
 Easy as a guarantee 
 Better yet, I'll show you what you wanna see

 Going to pop the culture

 Is looking like a sculpture 
 This recreation is amusing 
 And confusing 
 You never knew that it 
 Could feel so good while losing 
 What you lose? 
 Your virginity 
 Down on the river tonight 
 Take off your glasses and fight 
 I'll be your domino 
 Sit back and watch it flow 
 Get so emotional 
 I got a notion for 
 And when a star gets bent 
 I'll be your parliament 
 I'll be your domino 
 Sit back and watch it flow 
 My intuition was a 
 Poppin' and a shakin' 
 The very thought of it was 
 All too much to take in 
 Curl up with lover we 
 Could lie out on the blanket 
 This canopy above I'll 
 Take the time to thank it 
 Down on the river tonight 
 Take off your panties and fight 
 I'll be your domino 
 Sit back and watch it flow 
 Get so emotional 
 I got a notion for 
 And when a star gets bent 
 I'll be your parliament 
 I'll be your domino 
 Sit back and watch it flow 
 I want to bury my face 
 Deep in your aroma 
 Her name is Lisa 
 But they call her Desdemona 
 Come out and see me for 
 Some street communication 
 I think it's sweet of you 
 To be my motivation 
 I'll be your domino

 And when a star gets bent 
 I'll be your parliament

 Forty-two years young is a little bit old 
 Boy named Sue sing a Tennessee tune 
 Got buffalo love living on the moon 
 Save this lady for me [x4] 
 Call me Alabama I'm a Seminole prize 
 Got Times Square hair and a bedroom eyes 
 Keystone Kops and the billy bob chops 
 Gonna scare my kids gonna share my crops 
 Vampire blood and a baseball glove 
 Are just a little bit of what the girl is made of 
 National crash into the big lampoon 
 With a creature coming up from the black lagoon 
 Losing ground true sounds of liberty 
 The forest of the north might hold the key 
 Rocking to the rhythm of a ragtime band 
 Black flag wave on on my truck my man 
 Basketball Jones and the great unknowns 
 Got cheap cologne seventy-six trombones 
 Looking for the lady that won't be afraid 
 When heady needs a hammer gonna get things made 
 I got more love than anything else 
 But a Jezebel spirit gonna steal my health"

184,Red Hot Chili Peppers,rock,Police Station,"I saw you at the police station and it breaks my heart to say 
 Your eyes had wandered off to something distant cold and grey 
 I guess you didn't see it coming 
 Someone's gotten used to slumming 
 Dreaming of the golden years 
 I see you had to change careers 
 Far away, but we both know it's somewhere 
 I saw you on the back page of some free press yesterday 
 The driftwood in your eyes said nothing short of love for pay 
 I know you from another picture 
 Someone with the most conviction 
 We used to read the funny papers 
 Fooled around and pulled some capers 
 Not today, I send a message to her 
 A message that I'm coming, coming to pursue her 
 Down home country I rest my face on your bed 
 I got you ten times over, I'll chase you down 'til you're dead 
 I saw you on a TV station and it made me wanna pray 
 An empty shell of loveliness now dusted with decay 
 What happened to the funny paper? 
 Smiling was your money maker 
 Someone oughta situate her 
 Find a way to educate her 
 All the way, time to come and find you 
 You can't hide from me girl so never mind what I do 
 Down home country I rest my face on your bed 
 I met my soul mate country and I left it all for your head 
 I saw you in the churchyard there was no time to exchange 
 You were getting married and it felt so very strange 
 I guess I didn't see it coming 
 Now I guess it's me who's bumming 
 Dreaming of the golden years 
 You and I were mixing tears 
 Not today, not for me but someone 
 Never could get used to so now I will refuse to 
 Down home country, I rest my face on your bed 
 I met my soul mate country and I left it all for your head 
 I got my best foot forward and I'll chase you down 'til you're dead"
185,Red Hot Chili Peppers,rock,Even You Brutus?,"God is good and fate is great 
 When it feels so strong it's hard to wait 
 You never know how it might unfold 
 Hearts to break and bodies to hold 
 Time will tell but it never gets old 
 Like I told you, I'm in for the long long 
 Had to've been one of those things that took place in outer space 
 A match made in heaven, not a scratch on her face 
 Angels must have smoked some dust 
 Singing songs about ""In God We Trust"" 
 Some things slide but this is a must 
 Like I told you, there's a time for finding out 
 Ah people try to tell me what not to do 
 ""You shouldn't make it with a younger girl"" and 
 Too many chances for the foot to drop 
 I tried to tell 'em that I found a pearl, well... 
 Like I told you, be careful what you're asking for 
 Hey, sister Brutus 
 I've got a mess of a better half, oww 
 Hey, sister Judas! 
 Even you never had my back 
 She was the cutest thing that I ever did see 
 A drink in her hand and I don't mean tea 
 She was with a dude but I just didn't care 
 I had to find out, these moments are rare 
 And Stevie says, ""All is fair"" 
 Like I told you, there is something for everyone 
 Well I guess I never told you some things 
 That I really, really wanted to say 
 Did I do everything I could do 
 Or did the mice just need to play? 
 Like I told you, there's more than meets the eye 
 Hey, sister Brutus 
 I've got a mess of a better half, oww 
 I said hey, sister Judas! 
 Even you never had my back 
 I'm not trying to point fingers at you 
 And I'm not trying to lay any blame 
 But when it comes to the punishment, girl 
 You know how to bring the pain 
 Like I told you, I'd do it all again 
 Hey, sister Brutus 
 I've got a mess of a better half, oww 
 I said hey, sister Judas! 
 Even you never had my back 
 Come on 
 Hey, sister Brutus 
 There's a fury to the woman's wrath, oww 
 Hey, sister Judas! 
 Even you never had my back"

 Something I wanna show 
 I thought you'd wanna know

 To keep in touch out there 
 To see you on the corner 
 Well that I just can't bear 
 Meet me at the corner, and oh 
 Tell me what to do 
 'Cause I'm messed up on you 
 And had I known all that I do now 
 I'm guessing were through now 
 Receding into the forest 
 I will lay around and wait 
 Hey and I turn 
 I turn my head when I thought I saw a sign from the gods 
 A sign from the gods that you weren't meant to be mine 
 And it's fine 
 Taking it all for a ride 
 Till the day when it's gone 
 Mystified by where it all went wrong 
 When it's gone 
 I live and I learn 
 And I lose and I win 
 But it's better than ever whenever I'm in 
 Thank you girl for everywhere that I've been"

 And lesser known schemes 
 Were all about love 
 And less about

 I see you kept it versatile 
 Motivated to combine 
 Even when it's bad it's fine 
 Did she say something 
 That made you cry? 
 Have you lost it all? 
 The big fall 
 Oh so slowly 
 Comes back holy

 But I will put up quite a fight 
 Here is your ham on rye 
 Elementary the chemistry 
 Means everything to me 
 The long progression's why 
 Set it off to collect knowledge 
 Quit a job 
 And go to college 
 All about the aftershock 
 Swedish Latin super funk 
 Moses of Manhattan 
 Made it great 
 Pain we celebrate 
 And I love 
 The long progression indiscretion

 But I will put up quite a fight

 Are the psychedelic seasons 
 Simple as your stride

 Elegant and integrated 
 Sweet your floors with pride

 Spins a yarn and no one 
 Ever checked it out 
 To see if it was real 
 Sold you the moon 
 Now it's time to fall 
 All along 
 It's like a bird 
 Who's trapped alone 
 Inside your cage, love 
 What more do you want 
 How much more can you take 
 I love my mistakes 
 I've been here before 
 All and all 
 It's just the call 
 Of something wild 
 Beyond your room 
 There's a changing 
 Of the major chord 
 Your minor threat 
 Will do... love 
 My gun misfired 
 Shot myself instead 
 I guess I always knew 
 I'd be the one to lose 
 That screen door slams 
 Time to make a move 
 What more do you want 
 How much more can you take 
 I love my mistakes 
 I've been here before 
 All in all it's like the bird trapped alone inside the cage, love

 To live at half your age, girl 
 A bird who's 
 Never really had a say

 How much more can you take

 Until it turns into butter

 I will love you forever 
 When I heeded your call 
 And every heavy endeavor 
 I'll keep your place

 Somewhere out there 
 The family affair 
 Bring home the night

 The love of my life 
 Coming up short 
 And I'm sad to report 
 We fuss and fight tonight 
 Your case, my case 
 Another day to waste 
 Lovers don't mix 
 When they can't even fix 
 A plot that has a twist 
 To share, my prayer 
 I need my baby bear 
 Come home tonight

 The love of my life 
 The love of my life

 Now it's time to dance

 Jacked up on some Kerouac 
 And surely bulletproof

 Inside a woman's dorm 
 A couch to keep me humble 
 And her breath to keep me warm 
 Ophelia was the girl 
 That I was feeling for 
 Come to realize 
 It was me who was the whore 
 A captain lost himself 
 Inside a forty year old skull 
 The drink of choice was knowledge 
 And we always wanted more 
 Drunken sailors 
 Seeking their Geronimo 
 Instead they found the things 
 That they really didn't want to know

 Would never let me stay

 Were blended into one 
 Termites called suburbanites 
 Were eating all the fun 
 A juggernaut of comedy 
 And blasphemy 
 I wanna stop the madness 
 But I think it has to be 
 I say ""so long""

 Did I leave it better 
 Even though we look to be 
 Just mildly obsessed with you 
 Sail through 
 Someone like you 
 To research the meaning of love 
 Someone I do 
 To be there when push comes to shove 
 I know that you know 
 The ending, the must 
 Someone like you 
 To be there"
200,Red Hot Chili Peppers,rock,How It Ends,"Love is all the world 
 You say the world is gone 
 Love is all the world 
 You say it's gone 
 I don't 
 The party in your eyes 
 Says someone to caress 
 A party in the sky 
 I think I'll wear a dress 
 God saves us all and tell us how it ends 
 Laugh till we fall so why can't we be friends 
 Mother taught me what to do in cocktail times 
 Work and play all day until the sun is high 
 Haley and the comets 
 Saving an old rock jam 
 The ukulele play another song I'll brag 
 God saves us all and tell us how it ends 
 Laugh till we fall so why can't we be friends 
 Stole a lot from Peter 
 'Cause had to pay your Paul 
 And when you find that's not enough 
 He'll break your fall 
 Some get on and some 
 Get off the carousel 
 I think it's time to go 
 So I will fare thee well 
 God saves us all and tell us how it ends 
 Laugh till we fall so why can't we be friends 
 Stole a lot from Peter 
 'Cause had to pay your Paul 
 And when you find that's not enough 
 He'll break your fall"

 A delicate new arrival 
 Check the commute I do declare 
 Lets sing a new revival 
 Chemical circus at the pub 
 Mentally she's departed 
 Cut me a check I'll cut your rug 
 Later we'll get bombarded 
 'Cause everybody knows 
 The game is full of highs and lows 
 Like your mother said 
 Girl your father is dead 
 Everybody knows 
 That life is full of highs and lows 
 Is there always red 
 In your wedding bed 
 Everybody knows 
 Officer please I just got there 
 Traveled from door to door 
 Haven't you seen my girlfriend's hair 
 What are we looking for 
 'Cause everybody knows 
 The game is full of highs and lows 
 Like your mother said 
 Girl your father is dead 
 Everybody knows 
 That life is full of highs and lows 
 Is there always red 
 In your wedding bed

 In your wedding bed 
 Take me to the shore 
 Show me what it's for 
 Is there always red 
 In your wedding bed 
 Everybody knows 
 The game is full of cons and pros 
 Like your mother said 
 Girl your father's dead 
 Everybody knows"

 Pray for your children 
 The shelter they're building 
 Prime time, the perfect crime 
 Bow my head, the axe we grind 
 Ruse cruise, P's and Q's 
 I got beat up by the evening news 
 Deep hits, the media blitz 
 Lost my mind to keep my wits 
 Maintain the same old same 
 Goodbye shiz and so long game

 Saved by a star 
 Can I hold you to one thing

 Another day and another ride 
 I met a girl who wants to save the world

 I'm away, I'm away, I'm away

 The revolution in your blood 
 Creates the wave

 Looked a lot like a Mother Earth 
 She said, ""Hello, my name is Charlotte Gray"", hey 
 Make it safe

 Could, you know, could you take us to the, 
 The favelas and show us the prostitution and the drug deals and the night fights and the, 
 You know, the street life of your town, and he said sure, so we, we pull up to this hooker, 
 And she's wearing some kind of a, a bright green miniskirt, and it turns out it's a transsexual, 
 And he says ""Get over here!"" and she comes over and she thinks she's busted, but she's not busted.

 Was it something she said 
 We are dreams 
 Within a dream 
 So I remember we got our driver's license, and my friend Hillel had this little Dodson, painted green, and... 
 Hollywood would get so crazy in the winter--the rains would come and the hills would just kind of melt down into the city lights, 
 And, well, you know, we smoked weed and we'd go up in the hills and we'd listen to progressive rock music and just kind of trip out and... 
 Well, we would dream, you know, we would dream, and we would talk about what we wanted to do, and we would talk about girls and music, 
 And, you know, Hillel wanted to be a rock star--I didn't even know what that was, I was like, whatever you wanna do, man, I'm coming with you. 
 I'm right with you, my friend. 
 I get out of bed 
 And I clear up my head 
 I don't want to go

 We are dreams

 All these things that come down from the sky, raining upon your head, make you stop and wonder why ah! 
 Can't they just spell it out, make it clear, make it easy to read for the simple man like me? 
 I don't think so 
 I reach out to my family and I say 
 It's not about religion and the God sitting in a chair in the sky 
 With a punishing hand, oh 
 It's about heaven in your heart 
 Now when shall we start? 
 I wanna choose love instead of fear 
 Won't you come right now over here and be a part of my...

 This time 
 I love you"

 Blow by blow and go away

 Do you want to get up early in the morning? 
 Take me to the river where we do the little storming 
 Hallelujah, I feel it warming 
 Sitting here, I count the moons 
 The orders we obeyed 
 Every night 'fore we go to bed 
 I watch while the others pray 
 Send it off through Delaware 
 Just make it fair for the legionnaires 
 Paint a simple portrait of my kind 
 Permission to the heartless bombs 
 Gold-Plated Hate and the waitress moms 
 Serving up the stories of my mind 
 Mexico, you are my neighbor 
 Home of the ""let's be braver"" 
 Give me all your sick and your tired 
 Races that we admire 
 Do you want to go dancing in Chicago? 
 Trinidad's got it bad for Tobago 
 Take me to the lake where we do the Avocado

 The orders we obeyed 
 Every night 'fore we go to bed

 Send it off through Delaware 
 Just make it fair for the legionnaires 
 Paint a simple portrait of my kind 
 Permission to the heartless bombs 
 Gold-Plated Hate and the waitress moms 
 Serving up the stories of my mind 
 Coming down from the deserts where you 
 Caught a glimpse of the billionaire 
 Tell me I'm the right one for the ride 
 Paper signs out on the lawns 
 Gold minds and the priceless pawns 
 Does your canyon really open wide?

 We got a swimming pool and a cannonball

 I guess we're not so sacrosanct 
 The tip of my tongue but then we blanked 
 The wave is here 
 Waiting on the wind to tell my side 
 Ready, set, jet, but she never gets far 
 Listen to your skin from the seat of my car 
 Two centipedes stuck in one glass jar 
 The longest wave 
 Waiting on the wind to tell my side 
 Whatcha want? 
 Whatcha need? 
 Do you love? 
 Maybe I'm the right one 
 Maybe I'm the wrong 
 Just another play, the pirate and the papillon 
 Time to call it a day 
 Maybe you're my last love 
 Maybe you're my first 
 Just another way to play inside the universe 
 Now I know why we came 
 Sterile as the barrel of an old 12 gage 
 Under my skin and half my age 
 Hotter than the wax on a saxifrage 
 The longest wave 
 Waiting on the wind to turn my page 
 Steady your sails for the butterfly flap 
 Whatever you do, don't close that gap 
 I'm dreaming of a woman but she's just my nap 
 Your ship is in 
 Waiting on the tide so I can swim 
 Whatcha want? 
 Whatcha need? 
 Do you love? 
 Maybe I'm the right one 
 Maybe I'm the wrong 
 Just another play, the pirate and the papillon 
 Time to call it a day

 Do not dismiss the promise that you made me 
 Ayo ayo ayo ayo, my time 
 Overkill, you took another red pill 
 On the sheet is everything that you spilled 
 We are the ones you want to know right now 
 Ayo ayo ayo ayo, black light

 Just a friend to kiss you in the courtyard

 Slave to none

 Bloody hell, a common kamikaze 
 Give up the ghost before you go under

 I would have killed the part of me to have you

 Born to die in the eternal spring 
 Your flickering is more than just a small flame 
 Welcome to the party, it's a ball game 
 Pick up the stick, it's time to get hit with 
 Ayo ayo ayo ayo, my bat 
 Suicide is never going to save you

 You are the one I want to know right now

 Leave you feeling thirsty and so very fast 
 Chase your tail my baby, it'll be your last

 And am I crazy to join the lazy zoo 
 All these human butterflies 
 And cactus flowers' swollen eyes 
 And I want the devil's share 
 Of you I do declare 
 Again I'm asking can I do 
 When all these animals 
 Want to be just like you 
 I met a girl with long black hair 
 And she opened up so wide 
 A daffodil growing in Brazil 
 And I picked her for my bride

 Done it right 
 Done it right 
 Done it right"

 And now I know the signs for sure, for sure 
 Hold my hand 
 I want to share it all with Mary 
 Results are gonna vary now"
216,Red Hot Chili Peppers,rock,The Hunter,"Woke up this morning like I always do 
 I still like to think that I'm new 
 Time just gets its way 
 Strawberries left to decay 
 Can't find my pants or my bank account 
 Don't you slip away 
 Voices that start to betray 
 Even though you raised me, I will never be your father 
 King of each and every Sunset Marquis 
 Even though you're crazy, you will never be a bother 
 You're my Old Man In the Sea 
 I still like to laugh when I make a joke 
 I still like to think that there's hope 
 Time just has its say 
 Strawberries left to decay 
 Struck by the sight of an empty hall 
 Don't you fade away 
 Voices that start to betray 
 Even though you raised me, I will never be your father 
 King of each and every Sunset Marquis 
 Even though you're crazy, you will never be a bother 
 You're my Old Man in the Sea 
 The hunter gets hunted 
 We all get confronted 
 Don't just slip away 
 Voices that start to betray 
 Even though you raised me, I will never be your father 
 King of each and every Sunset Marquis 
 Even though you're crazy, you will never be a bother 
 You're my Old Man In the Sea"
217,Red Hot Chili Peppers,rock,Dreams Of A Samurai,"Standing naked in your kitchen 
 Feeling free, that I could be alive 
 Clearly, I'm a contradiction 
 Too young to be my wife 
 A peaceful storm is never hectic 
 Her mellow voice that I could be within 
 The uniform is anorexic 
 A jealous choice won't win 
 A metamorphosis samurai 
 You got a little lord fish 
 And you don't know why 
 I got a metamorphosis samurai 
 Paint your face 'cause I'm a Blackfoot 
 I thought I counted up the fireflies 
 Close enough to get a good look 
 Time to mobilize 
 A metamorphosis samurai 
 You got a little lord fish 
 And I don't know why 
 I got a metamorphosis samurai 
 I'm a lonely lad 
 I've lost myself out on the range 
 I don't remember much 
 So don't ask me, I've gone insane 
 Taking acid in a graveyard 
 Stealing food to keep the night alive 
 Every day I try to play hard 
 Even with my lies 
 The day they found you on a tour bus 
 The news was barren as a desert bone 
 The tabloids made a kind of small fuss 
 A couple pictures shown 
 I'm a lonely lad 
 I've lost myself out on the range 
 I don't remember much 
 So don't ask me, I've gone insane 
 Slowly turning into driftwood 
 No one ever wants to die alone 
 Thinking that a pretty gift could 
 Make you less unknown 
 Dirty sneakers on the pavement 
 The brilliant features of a common man 
 See the miracle of your life 
 No one ever can 
 I'm a lonely lad 
 I've lost myself out on the range 
 I don't remember much 
 So don't ask me, I've gone insane 
 See the world go by 
 The changes that we entertain 
 I don't recall it all 
 Remember, I have gone insane"
218,Red Hot Chili Peppers,rock,I Found Out,"I told you before, stay away from my door 
 Don't give me that brother, brother, brother, brother 
 The freaks on the phone, won't leave me alone 
 So don't give me that brother, brother, brother, brother 
 No! 
 I, I found out! 
 I, I found out! 
 Now that I showed you what I been through 
 Don't take nobody's word what you can do 
 There ain't no Jesus gonna come from the sky 
 Now that I found out I know I can cry 
 I, I found out! 
 I, I found out! 
 Some of you sitting there with your cock in your hand 
 Don't get you nowhere don't make you a man 
 I heard something 'bout my Ma and my Pa 
 They didn't want me so they made me a star 
 I, I found out! 
 I, I found out! 
 Old Hare Krishna got nothing on you 
 Just keep you crazy with nothing to do 
 Keep you occupied with pie in the sky 
 There ain't no guru who can see through your eyes 
 I, I found out! 
 I, I found out! 
 I've seen through junkies, I've been through it all 
 I seen religion from Jesus to Paul 
 Don't let them fool you with dope and cocaine 
 No one can harm you, feel your own pain 
 I, I found out! 
 I, I found this out! 
 I, I found out!"
219,Red Hot Chili Peppers,rock,I Want You Back,"When I had you to myself 
 I didn't want you around 
 Those pretty faces always seemed 
 To stand out in a crowd 
 But someone picked you from the bunch 
 One look was all it took 
 And now it's much too late for me 
 To take a second look 
 Oh baby, give me one more chance to 
 Show you I love you 
 Won't you please let me 
 Back in your heart 
 Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go 
 Let you go baby 
 Now since I've been true where it's at 
 I want you back!"
220,Red Hot Chili Peppers,rock,Maybe,"Maybe 
 If I prayed every night 
 You'll come back to me 
 And maybe 
 If I called everyday 
 You'll come back to stay 
 Ooh, maybe 
 Maybe 
 If I hold your hands 
 You will understand 
 And maybe, if I kissed your lips 
 I'd be at your command 
 Ooh, maybe... 
 Ooh, maybe..."
221,Red Hot Chili Peppers,rock,Melancholy Mechanics,"Persistant mystic faults my vision 
 It's like always this point of collision 
 It's raining in my cranium 
 My head feels like a stadium 
 3 pounds of grain 
 About to burst 
 Inside my 3 pound universe 
 It's raining in my cranium 
 My head feels like a stadium 
 These are the melancholy mechanics of my mind 
 Symbols I've been given to express my goal 
 Always come up short 
 You know they just don't get that low 
 It's raining in my cranium 
 My head feels like a stadium 
 These are the melancholy mechanics of my mind 
 Quick release chemicals strike with incomprehensible precision 
 Biorganic electronics targeting microscopic destinations of devastation 
 Cleaner than light 
 Meaner than a laser fight in the night 2000 
 Billions of micro maniacs unknown to most as the uncontrollable soldiers 
 Of suffering succotash 
 Instantaneous infiltration leaves me with a case of bustation, frustration, 
 Alone in the constellation of alienation 
 Detached from empty conversation 
 I wait 
 I wait for the wave to break"
222,Red Hot Chili Peppers,rock,"My Boy, My Girl","My boys, they like to tell me when I'm wrong [hey now] 
 My girl, she like to sing now sing my song 
 Everybody tell me when I'm wrong [today] 
 Anyway, I say 
 My boys (hey), they like to tell me when I'm bad [c'mon] 
 Make me happy when I'm sad [c'mon now] 
 Take it Johnny! 
 I said my girl, she like to say ""that's what I had"" 
 When I'm here, now when I'm wrong, and when I'm bad 
 Anyway, I'd like to say ""oh yeah"" 
 C'mon Chad! 
 My boy, he like to tell me what I had 
 Yeah now, what dyou do with everything you've had? 
 I don't know, that ain't bad 
 Woo, no, that ain't bad"
223,Red Hot Chili Peppers,rock,Politician (Mini Rap),"Not another motherfucking 
 Politician 
 Doin' nothin' but something for his own ambition 
 Huh..."

 (Hey man) Oh Henry, get off the phone, I gotta

225,Red Hot Chili Peppers,rock,Teenager In Love,"Each time we have a quarrel 
 It almost breaks my heart 
 'Cause I'm so afraid 
 That we will have to part 
 Each night I ask the stars up above 
 Why must I be a teenager in love? 
 One day I feel so happy 
 Next day I feel so sad 
 I guess I have to learn 
 The good with the bad 
 Each night I ask the stars up above 
 Why must I be a teenager in love? 
 I cried a tear 
 For nobody but you 
 I'll be the lonely one 
 If you should say we're through 
 Well, if you want to make me cry 
 That won't be so hard to do 
 If'n you should say goodbye 
 I'll still go on loving you 
 Each night I ask the stars up above 
 Why must I be a teenager in love? 
 I cried a tear 
 For nobody but you 
 I'll be the lonely one 
 If you should say we're through 
 Well, if you want to make me cry 
 That won't be so hard to do 
 And if you say goodbye 
 I'll still go on loving you 
 Each night I ask the stars up above 
 Why must I be a teenager in love? 
 Why must I be a teenager in love? 
 Why must I be a teenager in love? 
 Why must I be a teenager in love? 
 Why must I be a teenager in love? 
 Why must I be a teenager in love? 
 Why must I be a teenager in love?"
