3,Rush,rock,Here Again,"I said I played this song 
 So many times before 
 That the melody keeps repeating 
 Growing new ideas 
 Flowing chords and notes 
 Like a mountain river bleeding 
 Well I say as I look back 
 And all the thoughts I've had 
 They reflect just what I'm learning 
 Yes, you know that the hardest part 
 Yes, I say it is to stay on top 
 On top of a world forever churning

 But I can see that your eyes are blind 
 Well do you see, can't you see, can't you see what I'm feeling? 
 Yes I've seen your face before 
 Why, I've said I've seen it everywhere 
 Showing up to me without a scent revealing 
 Well, I said will it ever change? 
 Well yes lord I said will it stay the same? 
 I'd surely like to know before it's over 
 Well, I said I play this song 
 Yes I said it won't be long 
 Won't be long before I stop and play it over

8,Rush,rock,Anthem,"Know your place in life is where you want to be 
 Don't let them tell you that you owe it all to me 
 Keep on looking forward, no use in looking 'round 
 Hold your head above the crowd and they won't bring you down 
 Anthem of the heart and anthem of the mind 
 A funeral dirge for eyes gone blind 
 We marvel after those who sought 
 The wonders in the world, wonders in the world 
 Wonders in the world they wrought 
 Live for yourself 
 There's no one else more worth living for 
 Begging hands and bleeding hearts 
 Will only cry out for more 
 Anthem of the heart and anthem of the mind 
 A funeral dirge for eyes gone blind 
 We marvel after those who sought 
 The wonders in the world, wonders in the world 
 Wonders in the world they wrought 
 Well, I know they've always told you 
 Selfishness was wrong 
 Yet it was for me, not you 
 I came to write this song 
 Anthem of the heart and anthem of the mind 
 A funeral dirge for eyes gone blind 
 We marvel after those who sought 
 The wonders in the world, wonders in the world

 I'm not into that scene 
 You can tell me that I got no class 
 Look around, you'll see who's laughin' last 
 Don't give me speeches 'cause they're oh so droll 
 Leave me alone, let me rock and roll 
 Got an itchin' to rock, a hate for small talk 
 I'm funny that way 
 Got my sights on the stars, won't get that far 
 But I'll try anyway 
 I just like to please, I don't like to tease 
 I'm easy like that 
 Don't like long rests, I must confess 
 I'm an impatient cat

10,Rush,rock,"Beneath, Between & Behind","Ten score years ago, defeat the kingly foe 
 A wondrous dream came into being 
 Tame the trackless waste, no virgin land left chaste 
 All shining eyes, but never seeing 
 Beneath the noble bird 
 Between the proudest words 
 Behind the beauty, cracks appear 
 Once with heads held high 
 They sang out to the sky 
 Why do their shadows bow in fear? 
 Watch the cities rise, another ship arrives 
 Earth's melting pot and ever growing 
 Fantastic dreams come true, inventing something new 
 The greatest minds, but never knowing 
 Beneath the noble bird 
 Between the proudest words 
 Behind the beauty, cracks appear 
 Once with heads held high 
 They sang out to the sky 
 Why do their shadows bow in fear? 
 The guns replace the plow, facades are tarnished now 
 The principles have been betrayed 
 The dreams's gone stale, but still, let hope prevail 
 History's debt won't be repaid 
 Beneath the noble bird 
 Between the proudest words 
 Behind the beauty, cracks appear 
 Once with heads held high 
 They sang out to the sky 
 Why do their shadows bow in fear?"
11,Rush,rock,By-Tor & The Snow Dog,"I. At the Tobes of Hades 
 Tobes of Hades lit by flickering torchlight 
 The Netherworld is gathered in the glare 
 Prince By-Tor takes the cavern to the north light 
 The sign of Eth is rising in the air 
 By-Tor, knight of darkness 
 Centurion of evil, Devil's prince 
 II. Across the Styx 
 Across the river Styx out of the lamplight 
 His nemesis is waiting at the gate 
 The Snow Dog, ermine glowing in the damp night 
 A coal-black eye is shimmering with hate 
 By-Tor and the Snow Dog 
 Square for battle, let the fray begin 
 III. Of the Battle 
 (Instrumental) 
 IV. Epilogue 
 The battle's over and the dust is clearing 
 Disciples of the Snow Dog sound the knell 
 Rejoicing echoes as the dawn is nearing 
 By-Tor in defeat, retreats to Hell 
 Snow Dog is victorious 
 The land of the Overworld is safe again 
 Safe again"
12,Rush,rock,Fly By Night,"Why try? I know why 
 This feeling inside me says it's time I was gone 
 Clear head, new life ahead 
 It's time I was king now, not just one more pawn 
 Fly by night away from here 
 Change my life again 
 Fly by night, goodbye my dear 
 My ship isn't coming and I just can't pretend 
 Moon rise, thoughtful eyes 
 Staring back at me from the window beside 
 No fright or hindsight 
 Leaving behind that empty feeling inside 
 Fly by night away from here 
 Change my life again 
 Fly by night, goodbye my dear 
 My ship isn't coming and I just can't pretend, whoa! 
 Fly by night away from here 
 Change my life again 
 Fly by night, goodbye my dear 
 My ship isn't coming and I just can't pretend 
 Start a new chapter, I find what I'm after 
 It's changing every day 
 The change of the season's enough of a reason 
 To want to get away 
 Quiet and pensive, my thoughts apprehensive 
 The hours drift away 
 Leaving my homeland, playing alone 
 And my life begins today 
 Fly by night away from here 
 Change my life again 
 Fly by night, goodbye my dear 
 My ship isn't coming and I just can't pretend 
 My ship isn't coming and I just can't pretend 
 Fly by night away from here

13,Rush,rock,Making Memories,"There's a time for feeling as good as we can 
 The time is now, and there's no stopping us 
 There's a time for living as high as we can 
 Behind us you will only see our dust 
 So we just keep smiling, move onward every day 
 And try to keep our thoughts away from home 
 We're traveling all around, no time to settle down 
 And satisfy our wanderlust to roam, hey 
 You know we're having good days 
 And we hope they're gonna last 
 Our future still looks brighter than our past 
 We feel no need to worry 
 No reason to be sad 
 Our memories remind us, maybe road life's not so bad 
 Well from sea to shining sea, and a hundred points between 
 Still we go on digging every show 
 The cities in the land all extend a welcome hand 
 Till the morning when it's time for us to go 
 Well you know we're having good days 
 And we hope they're gonna last 
 Our future still looks brighter than our past 
 We feel no need to worry 
 No reason to be sad

 Soft winds stir the sighing trees 
 Lying in the warm grass 
 Feel the sun upon your face 
 Elven songs and endless nights 
 Sweet wine and soft relaxing lights 
 Time will never touch you 
 Here in this enchanted place 
 I've traveled now for many miles 
 It feels so good to see the smiles of 
 Friends who never left your mind 
 When you were far away 
 From the golden light of coming dawn 
 Till the twilight when the sun is gone 
 We treasure every season 
 And every passing day 
 You feel there's something calling you 
 You're wanting to return 
 To where the Misty Mountains rise and friendly fires burn 
 A place you can escape the world 
 Where the dark lord cannot go 
 Peace of mind and sanctuary by Loudwater's flow 
 We feel the coming of a new day 
 Dark gives way to light a new way 
 Stop here for a while until the world 
 The world calls you away 
 Yet you know I've had the feeling 
 Standing with my senses reeling 
 This is the place to grow old 'til 
 I reach my final day 
 You feel there's something calling you 
 You're wanting to return 
 To where the Misty Mountains rise and friendly fires burn 
 A place you can escape the world 
 Where the dark lord cannot go

16,Rush,rock,Bastille Day,"Ooh, there's no bread, let them eat cake 
 There's no end to what they'll take 
 Flaunt the fruits of noble birth 
 Wash the salt into the earth 
 But they're marching to Bastille Day 
 La guillotine will claim her bloody prize 
 Free the dungeons of the innocent 
 The king will kneel, and let his kingdom rise 
 Ooh, bloodstained velvet, dirty lace 
 Naked fear on every face 
 See them bow their heads to die 
 As we would bow when they rode by 
 And we're marching to Bastille Day 
 La guillotine will claim her bloody prize 
 Sing, o choirs of cacophony 
 The king has kneeled, to let his kingdom rise 
 Lessons taught, but never learned 
 All around us, anger burns 
 Guide the future by the past 
 Long ago, the mould was cast 
 For they marched up to Bastille Day 
 La guillotine claimed her bloody prize 
 Hear the echoes of the centuries 
 Power isn't all that money buys, whoa"

 My eyes just didn't seem so bright 
 I've lost a few more hairs 
 I think I'm, I'm going bald 
 I think I'm going bald 
 Ooh it seems like only yesterday 
 We would sit and talk of dreams all night 
 Dreams of youth 
 And simple truths 
 Now we're all so involved 
 So involved with life 
 I walk down vanity fair 
 Memory lane everywhere 
 Wall Street shuffles there 
 Dressed in flowing hair 
 Go wild! 
 Once we loved the flowers 
 Now we ask the price of the land 
 Once we would take water 
 But now it must be wine 
 Now we've been 
 And now we've seen 
 What price peace of mind 
 Take a piece of my mind 
 My life is slipping away 
 I'm aging every day 
 But even when I'm grey 
 I'll still be grey my way 
 Yeah

 Oh yeah 
 Oh yeah"
18,Rush,rock,Lakeside Park,"Midway hawkers calling, ""Try your luck with me"" 
 Merry-go-round wheezing same old melody 
 A thousand ten cent wonders, who could ask for more? 
 A pocketful of silver, the key to heaven's door 
 Lakeside Park, willows in the breeze 
 Lakeside Park, so many memories 
 Laughing rides, midway lights 
 Shining stars on summer nights 
 Days of barefoot freedom racing with the waves 
 Nights of starlit secrets, crackling driftwood flames 
 Drinking by the lighthouse, smoking on the pier 
 Still we saw the magic was fading every year 
 Lakeside Park, willows in the breeze 
 Lakeside Park, so many memories 
 Laughing rides, midway lights 
 Shining stars on summer nights 
 Everyone would gather on the twenty-fourth of May 
 Sitting in the sand to watch the fireworks display 
 Dancing fires on the beach, singing songs together 
 Though it's just a memory, some memories last forever"
19,Rush,rock,The Necromancer,"I. Into the Darkness 
 Spoken: 
 As grey traces of dawn tinge the eastern sky, 
 The three travelers, men of Willowdale, 
 Emerge from the forest shadow. 
 Fording the River Dawn, they turn south, journeying 
 Into the dark and forbidding lands of the Necromancer. 
 Even now the intensity of his dread power can be felt, 
 Weakening the body and saddening the heart. 
 Ultimately they will become empty, mindless spectres; 
 Stripped of will and soul, 
 Only their thirst for freedom 
 Gives them hunger for vengeance... 
 Silence shrouds the forest 
 As the birds announce the dawn 
 Three travellers ford the river 
 And southward journey on 
 The road is lined with peril 
 The air is charged with fear 
 The shadow of his nearness 
 Weighs like iron tears 
 II. Under the Shadow 
 Spoken: 
 Shreds of black cloud loom in overcast skies. 
 The Necromancer keeps watch with his magic prism eyes. 
 He views all his lands and is already aware 
 Of the three helpless invaders trapped in his lair... 
 Brooding in the tower 
 Watching o'er his land 
 Holding ev'ry creature 
 Helplessly they stand 
 Gaze into his prisms 
 Knowing they are near 
 Lead them to the dungeons 
 Spectres numb with fear 
 They bow defeated 
 III. Return of the Prince 
 Spoken: 
 Enter the Champion. 
 Prince By-Tor appears to battle for freedom 
 From chains of long years. 
 The spell has been broken; the Dark Lands are bright. 
 The Wraith of the Necromancer soars away in the night. 
 Stealthily attacking 
 By-Tor slays his foe 
 The men are free to run now 
 From labyrinths below 
 The Wraith of the Necromancer 
 Shadows through the sky 
 Another land to darken 
 With evil prism eye, whoa"
20,Rush,rock,The Fountain Of Lamneth,"I. In the Valley 
 I am born 
 I am me 
 I am new 
 I am free 
 Look at me 
 I am young 
 Sight unseen 
 Life unsung 
 My eyes have just been opened 
 And they're open very wide 
 Images around me 
 Don't identify inside 
 Just one blur I recognize 
 The one that soothes and feeds 
 My way of life is easy 
 And as simple are my needs 
 Yet my eyes are drawn toward 
 The mountain in the east 
 Fascinates and captivates 
 Gives my heart no peace 
 The mountain holds the sunrise 
 In the prison of the night 
 'Til bursting forth from rocky chains 
 The valley floods with light 
 Living one long sunrise 
 For to me all things are new 
 I've never watched the sky grow pale 
 Or strolled through fields of dew 
 I do not know of dust to dust 
 I live from breath to breath 
 I live to climb that mountain 
 To the Fountain of Lamneth 
 Yet my eyes are drawn toward 
 The mountain in the east 
 Fascinates and captivates 
 And gives my heart no peace 
 The mountain holds the sunrise 
 In the prison of the night 
 'Til bursting forth from rocky chains 
 The valley floods with light

 III. No One at the Bridge 
 Crying back to consciousness 
 The coldness grips my skin 
 The sky is pitching violently 
 Drawn by shrieking winds 
 Seaspray blurs my vision 
 Waves roll by so fast 
 Save my ship of freedom 
 I'm lashed helpless to the mast 
 Remembering when first I held 
 The wheel in my own hands 
 I took the helm so eagerly 
 And sailed for distant lands 
 But now the sea's too heavy 
 And I just, I just don't understand 
 Why must my crew desert me? 
 When I need, I need a guiding hand 
 Call out for direction 
 And there's no one there to steer 
 Shout out for salvation 
 But there's no one there to hear 
 Cry out supplication 
 For the maelstrom is near 
 Scream out desperation 
 But no one cares to hear 
 IV. Panacea 
 The whiteness of confusion 
 Is unfolding from my mind 
 I stare around in wonder 
 Have I left my life behind? 
 I catch the scent of ambergris 
 And turn my head, surprised 
 My gaze is caught and held and I 
 Am helpless, mesmerized 
 Panacea, liquid grace 
 Oh let me touch your fragile face 
 Enchantment falls around me 
 And I know I cannot leave 
 Here's a meaning for my life 
 A shelter from the storm 
 Pacify my troubles with 
 Her body, soft and warm 
 Naked in our unity 
 A smile for every tear 
 Gentle hands that promise me 
 Comfort through the years 
 Yet I know I must be gone 
 Before the light of dawn 
 Panacea, passion pure 
 I can't resist your gentle lure 
 My heart will lie beside you 
 And my wandering body grieves 
 V. Bacchus Plateau 
 Another endless day 
 Silhouettes of grey 
 Another glass of wine 
 Drink with eyes that shine 
 To days without that chill at morning 
 Long nights time out of mind 
 Draw another goblet 
 From the cask of '43 
 Crimson misty memory 
 Hazy glimpse of me 
 Give me back my wonder 
 I've something more to give 
 I guess it doesn't matter 
 There's not much more to, not much more to live 
 Another foggy dawn 
 The mountain almost gone 
 Another doubtful fear 
 The road is not so clear 
 My soul grows ever weary 
 And the end is ever near 
 Draw another goblet 
 From the cask of '43 
 Crimson misty memory 
 Hazy glimpse of me 
 Give me back my wonder 
 I've something more to give 
 I guess it doesn't matter 
 There's not much more to, not much more to live 
 VI. The Fountain 
 Look, the mist is rising 
 And the sun is peaking through 
 See the steps grow lighter 
 As I reach their final few 
 Hear the dancing waters 
 I must be drawing near 
 Feel, my heart is pounding 
 With embattled hope and fear 
 Now, at last I fall before 
 The Fountain of Lamneth 
 I thought I would be singing 
 But I'm tired, out of breath 
 Many journeys end here 
 But, the secret's told the same 
 Life is just a candle, and a dream 
 Must give it flame 
 The key, the end, the answer 
 Stripped of their disguise 
 Still it's all confusion 
 And tears spring to my eyes 
 Though I've reached a signpost 
 It's really not the end 
 Like Old Sol behind the mountain 
 I'll be coming up again 
 I'm in motion 
 I am still 
 I am crying 
 I am still 
 I'm together 
 I'm apart 
 I'm forever 
 At the start 
 Still I am"
21,Rush,rock,2112,"I. Overture 
 Yeah 
 Whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 And the meek shall inherit the earth 
 II. Temples of Syrinx 
 ... the massive grey walls of the temples rise from the Heart of every federation city. I have always been awed by them, to think that every single facet of every life is regulated and directed from within! our books, our music, our work and play are all looked after by the benevolent wisdom of the priests... 
 We've taken care of everything 
 The words you hear and the songs you sing 
 The pictures that give pleasure to your eyes 
 It's one for all and all for one 
 We work together, common sons 
 Never need to wonder how or why 
 We are the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx 
 Our great computers fill the hallowed halls 
 We are the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx 
 All the gifts of life are held within our wall 
 Look around this world we made 
 Equality, our stock in trade 
 Come and join the Brotherhood of Man 
 Oh, what a nice contented world 
 Let the banners be unfurled 
 Hold the Red Star proudly high in hand 
 We are the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx 
 Our great computers fill our hallowed halls 
 We are the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx 
 All the gifts of life are held within our walls 
 III. Discovery 
 ... behind my beloved waterfall, in the little room that was hidden beneath the cave, I found it. I brushed away the dust of the years, and picked it up, holding it reverently in my hands. I had no idea what it might be, but it was 
 beautiful ... 
 ... I learned to lay my fingers across the wires, and to turn the keys to make them sound differently. As I struck the wires with my other hand, I produced my first harmonious sounds, and soon my own music! how different it could be from the music of the temples! I cant wait to tell the priests about it! ... 
 What can this strange device be? 
 When I touch it, it gives forth a sound 
 It's got wires that vibrate and give music 
 What can this thing be that I found? 
 See how it sings like a sad heart 
 And joyously screams out its pain 
 Sounds that build high like a mountain 
 Or notes that fall gently like rain 
 I can't wait to share this new wonder 
 The people will all see its light 
 Let them all make their own music 
 The Priests praise my name on this night 
 IV. Presentation 
 ... in the sudden silence as I finished playing, I looked up to a circle of grim, expressionless faces. Father Brown rose to his feet, and his somnolent voice echoed throughout the silent temple hall. ... 
 ... instead of the grateful joy that I expected, they were words of quiet rejection! Instead of praise, sullen dismissal. I watched in shock and horror as Father Brown ground my precious instrument to splinters beneath his feet... 
 I know it's most unusual to come before you so 
 But I've found an ancient miracle I thought that you should know 
 Listen to my music, and hear what it can do 
 There's something here as strong as life 
 I know that it will reach you 
 Yes, we know, it's nothing new, it's just a waste of time 
 We have no need for ancient ways, the world is doing fine 
 Another toy that helped destroy the elder race of man! 
 Forget about your silly whim, it doesn't fit the plan 
 I can't believe you're saying, these things just can't be true 
 Our world could use this beauty, just think what we might do 
 Listen to my music, and hear what it can do 
 There's something here as strong as life 
 I know that it will reach you 
 Don't annoy us further, we have our work to do 
 Just think about the average - what use have they for you? 
 Another toy that helped destroy the elder race of man 
 Forget about your silly whim, it doesn't fit the plan 
 V. Oracle: The Dream 
 ... I guess it was a dream, but even now it all seems so vivid to me. Clearly yet I see the beckoning hand of the Oracle as he stood at the summit of the staircase ... 
 ... I see still the incredible beauty of the sculptured cities and the pure spirit of man revealed in the lives and works of this world. I was overwhelmed by both wonder and understanding as I saw a completely different way to life, a way that had been crushed by the federation long ago. I saw now how meaningless life had become with the loss of all these things ... 
 I wandered home though the silent streets 
 And fell into a fitful sleep 
 Escape to realms beyond the night 
 Dream, can't you show me the light? 
 I stand atop a spiral stair 
 An oracle confronts me there 
 He leads me on light years away 
 Through astral nights, galactic days 
 I see the works of gifted hands 
 That grace this strange and wondrous land 
 I see the hand of man arise 
 With hungry mind and open eyes 
 They left the planet long ago 
 The elder race still learn and grow 
 Their power grows with purpose strong 
 To claim the home where they belong 
 Home, to tear the Temples down 
 Home, to change 
 VI. Soliloquy 
 ... I have not left this cave for days now, it has become my last refuge in my total despair. I have only the music of the waterfall to comfort me now. I can no longer live under the control of the federation, but there is no other place to go. My last hope is that with my death I may pass into the world of my dream, and know peace at last. 
 The sleep is still in my eyes 
 The dream is still in my head 
 I heave a sigh and sadly smile 
 And lie a while in bed 
 I wish that it might come to pass 
 Not fade like all my dreams 
 Just think of what my life might be 
 In a world like I have seen 
 I don't think I can carry on 
 Carry on this cold and empty life 
 Oh, no 
 My spirits are low in the depths of despair 
 My lifeblood spills over

 Aboard the Thailand Express

 We only stop for the best 
 Wreathed in smoke in Lebanon 
 We burn the midnight oil 
 The fragrance of Afghanistan

 Pulling into Kathmandu 
 Smoke rings fill the air 
 Perfumed by a Nepal night 
 The Express gets you there 
 We're on the train to Bangkok 
 Aboard the Thailand Express

 We only stop for the best 
 We're on the train to Bangkok

 Wondering why no-one else is around 
 Look up to see a giant boy 
 You've just become his brand new toy 
 No escape no place to hide 
 Here where time and space collide

 I noticed emotion 
 And that you had cried 
 For me 
 I can see 
 What would touch me deeper 
 Tears that fall from eyes 
 That only cry? 
 Would it touch you deeper 
 Than tears that fall from eyes 
 That know why? 
 A lifetime of questions 
 Tears on your cheek 
 I tasted the answers 
 And my body was weak 
 For you 
 The truth 
 What would touch me deeper 
 Tears that fall from eyes 
 That only cry? 
 Would it touch you deeper 
 Than tears that fall from eyes 
 That know why?"
26,Rush,rock,Something For Nothing,"Waiting for the winds of change 
 To sweep the clouds away 
 Waiting for the rainbow's end 
 To cast its gold your way 
 Countless ways 
 You pass the days 
 Waiting for someone to call 
 And turn your world around 
 Looking for an answer 
 To the questions you have found 
 Looking for 
 An open door 
 You don't get something for nothing 
 You can't have freedom for free 
 You won't get wise with the sleep still in your eyes 
 No matter what your dream might be 
 What you own is your own kingdom 
 What you do is your own glory 
 What you love is your own power 
 What you live is your own story 
 In your head is the answer 
 Let it guide you along 
 Let your heart be the anchor 
 And the beat of your song 
 You don't get something for nothing 
 You can't have freedom for free"
27,Rush,rock,A Farewell To Kings,"When they turn the pages of history 
 When these days have passed long ago 
 Will they read of us with sadness 
 For the seeds that we let grow? 
 We turned our gaze 
 From the castles in the distance 
 Eyes cast down 
 On the path of least resistance 
 Cities full of hatred, fear and lies 
 Withered hearts and cruel, tormented eyes 
 Scheming demons dressed in kingly guise 
 Beating down the multitude and 
 Scoffing at the wise 
 The hypocrites are slandering 
 The sacred halls of Truth 
 Ancient nobles showering 
 Their bitterness on youth 
 Can't we find the minds that made us strong? 
 Oh, can't we learn to feel what's right 
 And what's wrong? 
 What's wrong? 
 Cities full of hatred, fear and lies 
 Withered hearts and cruel, tormented eyes 
 Scheming demons dressed in kingly guise 
 Beating down the multitude and 
 Scoffing at the wise 
 Oh can't we raise our eyes and make a start? 
 Can't we find the minds to lead us 
 Closer to the heart?"

 To walk the caves of ice 
 To break my fast on honey dew 
 And drink the milk of Paradise"" 
 I had heard the whispered tales 
 Of immortality 
 The deepest mystery 
 From an ancient book. I took a clue 
 I scaled the frozen mountain tops 
 Of eastern lands unknown 
 Time and Man alone 
 Searching for the lost - Xanadu 
 Xanadu 
 To stand within The Pleasure Dome 
 Decreed by Kubla Khan 
 To taste anew the fruits of life 
 The last immortal man 
 To find the sacred river Alph 
 To walk the caves of ice 
 Oh, I will dine on honey dew 
 And drink the milk of Paradise 
 A thousand years have come and gone 
 But time has passed me by 
 Stars stopped in the sky 
 Frozen in an everlasting view 
 Waiting for the world to end 
 Weary of the night 
 Praying for the light 
 Prison of the lost - Xanadu 
 Xanadu 
 Held within The Pleasure Dome 
 Decreed by Kubla Khan 
 To taste my bitter triumph 
 As a mad immortal man 
 Nevermore shall I return 
 Escape these caves of ice 
 For I have dined on honey dew 
 And drunk the milk of Paradise"

30,Rush,rock,Cinderella Man,"A modest man from Mandrake 
 Travelled rich to the city 
 He had a need to discover 
 A use for his newly found wealth 
 Because he was human 
 Because he had goodness 
 Because he was moral 
 They called him insane 
 Delusions of grandeur 
 Visions of splendour 
 A manic depressive 
 He walks in the rain 
 Eyes wide open 
 Heart undefended 
 Innocence untarnished 
 Cinderella Man, doing what you can 
 They can't understand what it means 
 Cinderella Man, hang on to your plans 
 Try as they might they cannot steal your dreams, whoa 
 In the betrayal of his love he awakened 
 To face a world of cold reality 
 And a look in the eyes of the hungry 
 Awakened him to what he could do 
 He held up his riches to challenge the hungry 
 Purposeful motion for one so insane 
 They tried to fight him, just couldn't beat him 
 This manic depressive who walks in the rain 
 Cinderella Man, doing what you can 
 They can't understand what it means 
 Cinderella Man, hang on to your plans 
 Try as they might they cannot steal your dreams"
31,Rush,rock,Madrigal,"When the dragons grow too mighty 
 To slay with pen or sword 
 I grow weary of the battle 
 And the storm I walk toward 
 When all around is madness 
 And there's no safe port in view 
 I long to turn my path homeward 
 To stop a while with you 
 When life becomes as barren 
 And as cold as winter skies 
 There's a beacon in the darkness 
 In a distant pair of eyes 
 In vain to search for honour 
 And in vain to search for truth 
 But these things can still be given 
 Your love has shown me proof"
32,Rush,rock,Cygnus X-1 Book I,"spoken: 
 ""In the constellation of Cygnus 
 There lurks a mysterious, invisible force 
 The black hole of Cygnus X-1"" 
 ""Six stars of the Northern Cross 
 In mourning for their sister's loss 
 In a final flash of glory 
 Nevermore to grace the night"" 
 1 
 Invisible to telescopic eye 
 Infinity, the star that would not die 
 All who dare to cross her course 
 Are swallowed by a fearsome force 
 Through the void, to be destroyed 
 Or is there something more? 
 Atomized at the core 
 Or through the astral door 
 To soar 
 2 
 I set a course just east of Lyra 
 And northwest of Pegasus 
 Flew into the light of Deneb 
 Sailed across the Milky Way 
 On my ship, the 'Rocinante' 
 Wheeling through the galaxies 
 Headed for the heart of Cygnus 
 Headlong into mystery 
 The x-ray is her siren song 
 My ship cannot resist her long 
 Nearer to my deadly goal 
 Until the black hole 
 Gains control 
 3 
 Spinning, whirling, still descending 
 Like a spiral sea unending 
 Sound and fury drowns my heart 
 Every nerve is torn apart"
33,Rush,rock,Cygnus X-1 Book II,"I. Prelude 
 When our weary world was young 
 The struggle of the ancients first began 
 The gods of Love and Reason 
 Sought alone to rule the fate of Man 
 They battled through the ages 
 But still neither force would yield 
 The people were divided 
 Every soul a battlefield 
 Every soul a battlefield 
 II. Apollo: Bringer of Wisdom 
 ""I bring truth and understanding 
 I bring wit and wisdom fair 
 Precious gifts beyond compare 
 We can build a world of wonder 
 I can make you all aware 
 I will find you food and shelter 
 Show you fire to keep you warm 
 Through the endless winter storm 
 You can live in grace and comfort 
 In the world that you transform."" 
 The people were delighted 
 Coming forth to claim their prize 
 They ran to build their cities 
 And converse among the wise 
 But one day the streets fell silent 
 Yet they knew not what was wrong 
 The urge to build these fine things 
 Seemed not to be so strong 
 The wise men were consulted 
 And the Bridge of Death was crossed 
 In quest of Dionysus 
 To find out what they had lost 
 III. Dionysus: Bringer of Love 
 ""I bring love to give you solace 
 In the darkness of the night 
 In the Heart's eternal light 
 You need only trust your feelings; 
 Only love can steer you right 
 I bring laughter, I bring music 
 I bring joy and I bring tears 
 I will soothe your primal fears 
 Throw off those chains of reason 
 And your prison disappears."" 
 The cities were abandoned 
 And the forests echoed song 
 They danced and lived as brothers; 
 They knew love could not be wrong 
 Food and wine they had aplenty 
 And they slept beneath the stars 
 The people were contented 
 And the Gods watched from afar 
 But the winter fell upon them 
 And it caught them unprepared 
 Bringing wolves and cold starvation 
 And the hearts of men despaired 
 IV. Armageddon: The Battle of Heart and Mind 
 The Universe divided 
 As the Heart and Mind collided 
 With the people left unguided 
 For so many troubled years 
 In a cloud of doubts and fears 
 Their world was torn asunder into hollow Hemispheres 
 Some fought themselves, some fought each other 
 Most just followed one another 
 Lost and aimless like their brothers 
 For their hearts were so unclear 
 And the truth could not appear 
 Their spirits were divided into blinded Hemispheres 
 Some who did not fight 
 Brought tales of old to light 
 My Rocinante' sailed by night 
 On her final flight 
 To the heart of Cygnus' fearsome force 
 We set our course 
 Spiralled through that timeless space 
 To this immortal place 
 V. Cygnus: Bringer of Balance 
 I have memory and awareness 
 But I have no shape or form 
 As a disembodied spirit 
 I am dead and yet unborn 
 I have passed into Olympus 
 As was told in tales of old 
 To the city of Immortals 
 Marble white and purest gold 
 I see the gods in battle rage on high 
 Thunderbolts across the sky 
 I cannot move, I cannot hide 
 I feel a silent scream begin inside 
 Then all at once the chaos ceased 
 A stillness fell, a sudden peace 
 The warriors felt my silent cry 
 And stayed their struggle, mystified 
 Apollo was astonished; 
 Dionysus thought me mad 
 But they heard my story further 
 And they wondered, and were sad 
 Looking down from Olympus 
 On a world of doubt and fear 
 Its surface splintered 
 Into sorry Hemispheres 
 They sat a while in silence 
 Then they turned at last to me 
 ""We will call you Cygnus 
 The god of Balance you shall be."" 
 VI. The Sphere: A Kind of Dream 
 We can walk our road together 
 If our goals are all the same 
 We can run alone and free 
 If we pursue a different aim 
 Let the truth of love be lighted 
 Let the love of truth shine clear 
 Sensibility, armed with sense and liberty 
 With the Heart and Mind united in a single perfect sphere"
34,Rush,rock,Circumstances,"A boy alone and so far from home 
 Endless rooftops from my window 
 I felt the gloom of empty rooms

 All the same 
 We take our chances 
 Laughed at by time 
 Tricked by circumstances 
 Plus ça change 
 Plus c'est la même chose 
 The more that things change 
 The more they stay the same 
 Now I've gained some understanding 
 Of the only world that we see 
 Things that I once dreamed of 
 Have become reality 
 These walls that still surround me 
 Still contain the same old me 
 Just one more who's searching for 
 The world that ought to be 
 All the same 
 We take our chances 
 Laughed at by time 
 Tricked by circumstances 
 Plus ça change

35,Rush,rock,The Trees,"There is unrest in the forest 
 There is trouble with the trees 
 For the maples want more sunlight 
 And the oaks ignore their pleas 
 The trouble with the maples 
 And they're quite convinced they're right 
 They say the oaks are just too lofty 
 And they grab up all the light 
 But the oaks can't help their feelings 
 If they like the way they're made 
 And they wonder why the maples 
 Can't be happy in their shade 
 There is trouble in the forest 
 And the creatures all have fled 
 As the maples scream, ""Oppression"" 
 And the oaks just shake their heads 
 So the maples formed a union 
 And demanded equal rights 
 ""The oaks are just too greedy 
 We will make them give us light"" 
 Now there's no more oak oppression 
 For they passed a noble law 
 And the trees are all kept equal 
 By hatchet, axe, and saw"

 A companion unobtrusive 
 Plays that song that's so elusive 
 And the magic music makes your morning mood 
 Off on your way, hit the open road 
 There is magic at your fingers 
 For the spirit ever lingers 
 Undemanding contact in your happy solitude 
 Invisible airwaves crackle with life 
 Bright antennae bristle with the energy 
 Emotional feedback on a timeless wavelength 
 Bearing a gift beyond price, almost free 
 All this machinery making modern music 
 Can still be open-hearted 
 Not so coldly charted, it's really just a question 
 Of your honesty, yeah, your honesty 
 One likes to believe in the freedom of music 
 But glittering prizes and endless compromises 
 Shatter the illusion of integrity, yeah 
 Invisible airwaves crackle with life 
 Bright antennae bristle with the energy 
 Emotional feedback on a timeless wavelength 
 Bearing a gift beyond price, almost free 
 For the words of the profits were written on the studio wall 
 Concert hall 
 And echoes with the sound of salesmen 
 Of salesmen, of salesmen"
37,Rush,rock,Freewill,"There are those who think that life 
 Has nothing left to chance, 
 A host of holy horrors

 Or the gods are malign"" 
 Blame is better to give than receive. 
 You can choose a ready guide 
 In some celestial voice. 
 If you choose not to decide 
 You still have made a choice 
 You can choose from phantom fears 
 And kindness that can kill; 
 I will choose a path that's clear- 
 I will choose free will 
 There are those who think that 
 They've been dealt a losing hand, 
 The cards were stacked against them- 
 They weren't born in Lotus-Land

 A victim of venomous fate 
 Kicked in the face

 A cell of awareness 
 Imperfect and incomplete 
 Genetic blends 
 With uncertain ends 
 On a fortune hunt 
 That's far too fleet.

38,Rush,rock,Jacob's Ladder,"The clouds prepare for battle 
 In the dark and brooding silence 
 Bruised and sullen stormclouds 
 Have the light of day obscured 
 Looming low and ominous 
 In twilight premature 
 Thunderheads are rumbling 
 In a distant overture 
 All at once, the clouds are parted 
 Light streams down in bright unbroken beams 
 Follow men's eyes as they look to the skies 
 The shifting shafts of shining weave the fabric of their dreams"
39,Rush,rock,Entre Nous,"We are secrets to each other 
 Each one's life a novel 
 No-one else has read 
 Even joined in bonds of love 
 We're linked to one another 
 By such slender threads 
 We are planets to each other 
 Drifting in our orbits 
 To a brief eclipse 
 Each of us a world apart 
 Alone and yet together 
 Like two passing ships

 Did it go out of style? 
 Along with our naiveté

 Different hearts beat on different strings 
 But there are times 
 For you and me

 Along the rocky shoreline 
 It leaves a trail of tide pools

 A complete society 
 A simple kind of mirror 
 To reflect upon our own 
 All the busy little creatures 
 Chasing out their destinies 
 Living in their pools 
 They soon forget about the sea...

 No wonder they don't understand

 Science, like nature, must also be tamed 
 With a view towards its preservation 
 Given the same state of integrity 
 It will surely serve us well 
 Art as expression, not as market campaigns 
 Will still capture our imaginations 
 Given the same state of integrity 
 It will surely help us along 
 The most endangered species - the honest man - 
 Will still survive annihilation 
 Forming a world, a state of integrity - 
 Sensitive, open, and strong 
 Wave after wave will flow with the tide 
 And bury the world as it does 
 Tide after tide will flow and recede 
 Leaving life to go on as it was"

 Catch the spirit, catch the spit

 He says it used to be a farm, before the Motor Law 
 And on Sundays I elude the 'Eyes', and hop the Turbine freight 
 To far outside the Wire, where my white-haired uncle waits 
 Jump to the ground 
 As the Turbo slows to cross the borderline 
 Run like the wind 
 As excitement shivers up and down my spine 
 Down in his barn 
 My uncle preserved for me an old machine - 
 For fifty-odd years 
 To keep it as new has been his dearest dream 
 I strip away the old debris, that hides a shining car 
 A brilliant red Barchetta, from a better, vanished time 
 Fire up the willing engine, responding with a roar! 
 Tires spitting gravel, I commit my weekly crime... 
 Wind in my hair - 
 Shifting and drifting - 
 Mechanical music - 
 Adrenaline surge - 
 Well-weathered leather 
 Hot metal and oil 
 The scented country air 
 Sunlight on chrome 
 The blur of the landscape 
 Every nerve aware 
 Suddenly, ahead of me, across the mountainside 
 A gleaming alloy air-car, shoots towards me, two lanes wide 
 I spin around with shrieking tires, to run the deadly race 
 Go screaming through the valley as another joins the chase 
 Run like the wind 
 Straining the limits of machine and man 
 Laughing out loud 
 With fear and hope, I've got a desperate plan 
 At the one-lane bridge 
 I leave the giants stranded 
 At the riverside 
 Race back to the farm 
 To dream with my uncle 
 At the fireside..."

 Steeped in the history of London

 In the whispy white veil

 Alive in the streets of the city 
 Are they oblivious 
 To this quality?

 Unique to every city's streets

 Quiet in conscience, calm in their right - 
 Confident their ways are best

 To beat, and burn, and kill

 In our immigrants and infidels 
 They say there is strangeness, too dangerous

 Staring at the sky

 As a hawk goes soaring by 
 And the boy pulls down his baseball cap 
 And covers up his eyes

 Couldn't we talk about 
 Something else instead

 Says the national midnight star

 The soviets are the blues 
 The reds, under your bed 
 Lying in the darkness 
 Dead ahead 
 And the mercury is rising 
 Barometer starts to fall 
 You know it gets to us all 
 The pain that is learning 
 And the rain that is burning 
 Feel red, still, go ahead 
 You see black and white

 A lot of useless talk

 So much poison in power 
 The principles get left out 
 So much mind on the matter

 Overlooked in haste 
 Like a teardrop in the ocean 
 A diamond in the waste

 In each nation always eager to explore 
 To build the best big stick

 Something always fires the light

 One moment's high 
 And glory rolls on by 
 Like a streak of lightning 
 That flashes and fades 
 In the summer sky 
 Your meters may overload 
 You can rest at the side of the road 
 You can miss a stride 
 But nobody gets a free ride 
 More than high performance 
 More than just a spark 
 More than just the bottom line 
 Or a lucky shot in the dark

 If you don't burn out too fast 
 You can make the most of the distance

 While their invaders dream of lands they've left behind 
 Better people - better food - and better beer 
 Why move around the world when Eden was so near? 
 The bosses get talking so tough 
 And if that wasn't evil enough 
 We get the drunken and passionate pride

 Another day as drab as today 
 Is more than a man can endure

 Drive you when you're down 
 Dreams transport the ones 
 Who need to get out of town 
 The boy walks with his best friend 
 Through the fields of early May 
 They walk awhile in silence 
 One close, one far away 
 He'd be climbing on that bus 
 Just him and his guitar 
 To blaze across the heavens 
 Like a brilliant shooting star 
 The middle-aged madonna 
 Calls her neighbour on the phone 
 Day by day the seasons pass 
 And leave her life alone 
 But she'll go walking out that door 
 On some bright afternoon 
 To go and paint big cities 
 From a lonely attic room 
 Dreams flow across the heartland 
 Feeding on the fires 
 Dreams transport desires 
 Drive you when you're down 
 Dreams transport the ones 
 Who need to get out of town 
 Out of town 
 It's understood 
 By every single person 
 Who'd be elsewhere if they could 
 So far so good 
 And life's not unpleasant 
 In their little neighborhood 
 Dreams flow across the heartland 
 Feeding on the fires 
 Dreams transport desires 
 Drive you when you're down

 And start acting like a fool 
 If we need too much approval 
 Then the cuts can seem too cruel

 Illusions are painfully shattered 
 Right where discovery starts 
 In the secret wells of emotion 
 Buried deep in our hearts 
 It's true that love can change us 
 Never quite enough 
 Sometimes we are too tender 
 Sometimes we're too tough 
 If we get too much attention 
 It gets hard to overrule 
 So often fragile power turns 
 To scorn and ridicule 
 Sometimes our big splashes 
 Are just ripples in the pool

 Stringing us along?

 I gaze at their feverish pictures 
 The secrets that set them apart 
 When I feel the powerful visions 
 Their fire has made alive 
 I wish I had that instinct 
 I wish I had that drive 
 Spirits fly on dangerous missions 
 Imaginations on fire 
 Focussed high on soaring ambitions 
 Consumed in a single desire 
 In the grip of a nameless possesion 
 A slave to the drive of obsession 
 A spirit with a vision 
 Is a dream with a mission 
 I watch their images flicker 
 Bringing life to a lifeless screen 
 I walk through their beautiful buildings 
 And I wish I had their dreams 
 But dreams don't need to have motion 
 To keep their spark alive 
 Obsession has to have action 
 Pride turns on the drive 
 Spirits fly on dangerous missions 
 Imaginations on fire 
 Focussed high on soaring ambitions 
 Consumed in a single desire 
 In the grip of a nameless possesion 
 A slave to the drive of obsession 
 A spirit with a vision 
 Is a dream with a mission 
 It's cold comfort 
 To the ones without it 
 To know how they struggled 
 How they suffered about it 
 If their lives were exotic and strange 
 They would likely have gladly exchanged them 
 For something a little more plain 
 Maybe something a little more sane 
 We each pay a fabulous price 
 For our visions of paradise 
 But a spirit with a vision 
 Is a dream with a mission 
 A spirit with a vision 
 Is a dream"
79,Rush,rock,Turn The Page,"Nothing can survive in a vacuum 
 No one can exist all alone 
 We pretend things only happen to strangers 
 We've all got problems of our own 
 It's enough to learn to share our pleasures 
 We can't soothe pain with sympathy 
 All that we can do is be reminded 
 We shake our heads at the tragedy 
 Every day we're standing in a time capsule 
 Racing down a river from the past 
 Every day we're standing in a wind tunnel 
 Facing down the future coming fast 
 It's just the age 
 It's just a stage 
 We disengage 
 We turn the page 
 Looking at the long-range forecast 
 Catching all the names in the news 
 Checking out the state of the nation 
 Learning the environmental views 
 Truth is after all a moving target 
 Hairs to split and pieces that don't fit 
 How can anybody be enlightened? 
 Truth is after all so poorly lit 
 Every day we're standing in a time capsule 
 Racing down a river from the past 
 It's just the age 
 It's just a stage

80,Rush,rock,Tai Shan,"High on the sacred mountain 
 Up the seven thousand stairs 
 In the golden light of autumn 
 There was magic in the air 
 Clouds surrounded the summit 
 The wind blew strong and cold 
 Among the silent temples 
 And the writings carved in gold 
 Somewhere in my instincts 
 The primitive took hold 
 I stood at the top of the mountain 
 And China sang to me 
 In the peaceful haze of harvest time 
 A song of eternity 
 If you raise your hands to heaven 
 You will live a hundred years 
 I stood there like a mystic 
 Lost in the atmosphere 
 The clouds were suddenly parted 
 For a moment I could see 
 The patterns of the landscape 
 Reaching for the eastern sea 
 I looked upon a presence 
 Spanning forty centuries 
 I stood at the top of the mountain 
 And China sang to me 
 In the peaceful haze of harvest time 
 A song of eternity 
 I thought of time and distance 
 The hardships of history 
 I heard the hope and the hunger 
 When China sang to me 
 When China sang to me"
81,Rush,rock,High Water,"When the waters rose in the darkness 
 In the wake of the endless flood 
 It flowed into our memory 
 It flowed into our blood 
 When something broke the surface 
 Just to see the starry dome 
 We still feel that relation 
 When the water takes us home 
 In the flying spray of the ocean 
 The water takes you home 
 The water takes you home 
 Springing from the weight of the mountains 
 Like the heart of the Earth would burst 
 Flowing out from marble fountains 
 In the dreams of a desert thirst 
 Something swam through the jungles 
 Where the mighty rivers roam 
 Something breaks the silence 
 When the water takes you home 
 I hear, hear the wordless voices 
 When the water takes me home 
 When the water takes me home 
 Waves that crash on the shoreline 
 Torrents of tropical rain 
 Streaming down beyond our memory 
 Streaming down inside our veins 
 When something left the ocean 
 To crawl high above the foam 
 We still feel that elation 
 When the water takes us home 
 In a driving rain of redemption 
 The water takes me home 
 The water takes me home 
 Take me home"

 Martyr without a cause

 Electrical storm in your veins

 Straining at invisible chains 
 And now you're trembling on a rocky ledge 
 Staring down into a heartless sea

 Blocks the only road 
 It's not as if you're all alone 
 In wanting to explode 
 Someone set a bad example 
 Made surrender seem all right 
 The act of a noble warrior 
 Who lost the will to fight

 Staring down into a heartless sea 
 Done with life on a razor's edge

 No salutes for your surrender 
 Nothing noble in your fate

 Checks his camouflage 
 Polishes his armor

 If he can take the fight 
 Pound the drums with martial beat 
 Pound the streets with marching feet

 I've stood upon my mountaintop 
 And shouted at the sky 
 Walked above the pavement

 Tender to the touch 
 Sometimes super sensitive 
 But who can care too much? 
 I get this feeling 
 Scars of pleasure 
 Scars of pain 
 Atmospheric changes 
 Make them sensitive again 
 Scars of pleasure 
 Scars of pain 
 Atmospheric changes 
 Make them sensitive again 
 Each emotional injury 
 Leaves behind it's mark 
 Sometimes they come tumbling out 
 Like shadows in the dark 
 I get this feeling 
 When I think about all I have seen 
 And all I've never seen 
 When I think about the people 
 Who have opened up to me 
 I get this feeling 
 Scars of pleasure 
 Scars of pain 
 Atmospheric changes 
 Make them sensitive again 
 Scars of pleasure 
 Scars of pain 
 Atmospheric changes 
 Make them sensitive again 
 Snow falls deep around my house 
 And holds the winter light 
 I've heard the lions hunting 
 In the Serengeti night 
 I get this feeling 
 Forests turned to factories 
 And river, sea, and sky 
 Hungry child in the desert 
 And the flies that cloud her eyes 
 I get this feeling 
 Scars of pleasure

 Like a stranger coming out of the rain 
 The evening plane rises up from the runway 
 Over constellations of light 
 I look down into a million houses 
 And wonder what you're doing tonight 
 If I could wave my magic wand 
 I'd make everything all right 
 I'm not one to believe in magic 
 But I sometimes have a second sight 
 I'm not one with a sense of proportion 
 When my heart still changes overnight 
 I had a dream of a winter garden 
 A midnight rendezvous 
 Silver, blue, and frozen silence 
 What a fool I was for you 
 I had a dream of the open water 
 I was swimming away out to sea 
 So deep I could never touch bottom 
 What a fool I used to be 
 If I could wave my magic wand 
 I'd set everybody free 
 I'm not one to believe in magic 
 Though my memory has a second sight 
 I'm not one to go pointing my finger

 Don't ask me, I'm just improvising 
 My illusion of careless flight 
 Can't you see my temperature's rising 
 I radiate more heat than light 
 Don't ask me I'm just sympathizing 
 My illusion's a harmless flight 
 Can't you see my temperature's rising

 The cosmic is largely comic 
 A con they couldn't conceal 
 There is no safe seat at the feast

 The saint is turning to sin 
 Raise the art to resistance 
 Danger dare to be grand 
 Pride reduced to humble pie 
 Diamonds down to sand 
 Take heart in the earth and the weather 
 The brightness of new birth 
 Take heart on the harvest 
 Shave the harvest from the earth 
 There is no safe seat at the feast 
 Take your best stab at the beast 
 The night is turning thin 
 The saint is turning to sin 
 Reasoning is partly insane 
 Image just an eyeless game 
 The night is turning thin 
 The saint is turning to sin 
 Miracles will have their claimers 
 More will bow to Rome 
 He and she are in the house 
 But it's only me at home 
 Rose is a rose of splendor 
 Posed to respond in the end 
 Lonely things like nights, 
 I find, end finer with a friend 
 I hear in the rate of her heart 
 A tear in the heat of the art

 Take your best stab at the beast

 This is not a false alarm 
 This is not a test 
 Stay out of the sun 
 It only burns my skin 
 Sky full of poison

 Bless the sun, the rain no more 
 River running like an open sore 
 Black wind falling to the ocean floor 
 And the red tide washes ashore 
 This is not a false alarm 
 This is not a test

 The party is disrupted by an uninvited guest 
 Deadline approaches 
 For the weary land 
 It used to be something 
 But we let it run down in our hands 
 Too late for debate, too bad to ignore 
 Quiet rebellion leads to open war 
 Bring a sea change to the factory floor 
 As the red tide covers the shore 
 Now's the time to turn the tide 
 Now's the time to fight 
 Let us not go gently 
 To the endless winter night 
 Now's the time to make the time 
 While hope is still in sight

 Good work is the key to good fortune 
 Winners take that praise 
 Losers seldom take that blame 
 If they don't take that game 
 And sometimes the winner takes nothing 
 We draw our own designs 
 But fortune has to make that frame 
 We go out in the world and take our chances 
 Fate is just the weight of circumstances 
 That's the way that lady luck dances 
 Roll the bones, roll the bones 
 Why are we here? 
 Because we're here 
 Roll the bones, roll the bones 
 Why does it happen? 
 Because it happens 
 Roll the bones, roll the bones 
 Faith is cold as ice 
 Why are little ones born only to suffer 
 For the want of immunity 
 Or a bowl of rice? 
 Well, who would hold a price 
 On the heads of the innocent children 
 If there's some immortal power 
 To control the dice? 
 We come into the world and take our chances 
 Fate is just the weight of circumstances 
 That's the way that lady luck dances

 Get busy with the facts 
 No zodiacs or almanac 
 No maniacs in polyester slacks 
 Just the facts 
 Gonna kick some gluteus max 
 It's a parallax, you dig? 
 You move around 
 The small gets big 
 It's a rig 
 It's action, reaction 
 Random interaction 
 So who's afraid 
 Of a little abstraction? 
 Can't get no satisfaction 
 From the facts? 
 You better run, homeboy 
 A fact's a fact 
 From Nome to Rome boy 
 What's the deal? Spin the wheel 
 If the dice are hot -- take a shot 
 Play your cards 
 Show us what you got 
 What you're holding. 
 If the cards are cold, 
 Don't go folding 
 Lady luck is golden 
 She favors the bold 
 That's cold 
 Stop throwing stones 
 The night has a thousand saxophones 
 So get out there and rock 
 And roll the bones 
 Get busy!

 I placed no trust in a faith that was ready made 
 Take no chances on paradise delayed

 Prisoner of fate, victim of circumstance 
 I was lined up for glory, but the tickets sold out in advance 
 The way the big wheel spins 
 Well I was only a kid, gone without a backward glance 
 Going for broke, going for another chance 
 Hoping for heaven, hoping for a fine romance 
 If I do the right dance 
 Playing for time 
 Don't want to wait for heaven 
 Looking for love 
 For an angel to forgive my sins 
 Playing with fire 
 Chasing something new to believe in 
 Looking for love

 Wheel goes round, landing on a twist of faith 
 Taking your chances you'll have the right answers 
 When the final judgement begins 
 Wheel goes round, landing on a leap of fate 
 Life redirected in ways unexpected 
 Sometimes the odd number wins 
 The way the big wheel spins 
 Playing for time 
 Don't want to wait for heaven 
 Looking for love 
 For an angel to forgive my sins 
 Playing with fire 
 Chasing something new to believe in 
 Looking for love

 Every bridge that we burned

 And make it last

 Through the backstreets of youth 
 Each time we turn a new corner 
 Tiny moment of truth 
 For so many different connections

 Gears and iron chains 
 Turn the grinding wheel 
 I run between the shadows 
 Some are phantoms, some are real 
 Where would you rather be? 
 Anywhere, anywhere but here 
 When will the time be right? 
 Anytime but now 
 Where would you rather be? 
 The doubt and fear 
 I know will all disappear 
 Anywhere but here, anywhere but here 
 On the edge of sleep 
 I heard voices behind the door 
 The known and the nameless 
 Familiar and faceless 
 My angels and my demons at war, at war 
 Which one will lose depends on what I choose 
 Or maybe which voice I ignore 
 Wilderness of mirrors 
 Streets of cold desire 
 My precious sense of honor 
 Just a shield of rusty wire 
 I hold against the chaos 
 And the cross of holy fire 
 Where would you rather be? 
 Anywhere, anywhere but here 
 When will the time be right? 
 Anytime but now 
 Where would you rather be? 
 The doubt and fear 
 I know will all disappear 
 Anywhere but here, anywhere but here 
 Wilderness of mirrors 
 So easy to deceive 
 My precious sense of rightness 
 Is sometimes so naive 
 So that which I imagine 
 Is that which I believe 
 On the edge of sleep, I awoke to a sun so bright 
 Rested and fearless, cheered by your nearness 
 I knew which direction was right, was right 
 The case has been tried by the jury inside 
 The choice between darkness and light 
 The choice between darkness and light"
111,Rush,rock,Cold Fire,"Cold fire, it's a cold fire 
 It's a cold fire, it's a cold fire 
 It was long after midnight 
 When we got to unconditional love 
 She said sure my heart is boundless 
 But don't push my limits too far 
 I said if love is so transcendent 
 I don't understand these boundaries 
 She said just don't disappoint me 
 You know how complex women are 
 I'll be around 
 If you don't let me down too far 
 I'll be around 
 If you don't let me down 
 It was just before sunrise 
 When we started on traditional roles 
 She said sure I'll be your partner 
 But don't make too many demands 
 I said if love has these conditions 
 I don't understand those songs you love 
 She said this is not a love song 
 This isn't fantasy land 
 Don't go too far 
 The phosphorescent wave on a tropical sea 
 Is a cold fire 
 Don't cross the line 
 The pattern of moonlight on the bedroom floor 
 Is a cold fire 
 Don't let me down 
 The flame at the heart of a pawnbroker's diamond 
 Is a cold fire 
 Don't break the spell 
 The look in your eyes as you head for the door 
 Is a cold fire 
 I'll be around 
 If you don't push me down too far 
 I'll be around 
 If you don't push me down 
 I'll be around 
 If you don't push me down to far 
 I'll be around 
 If you don't push me down 
 Don't go too far

 Don't cross the line 
 The pattern of moonlight on the bedroom floor 
 Is a cold fire 
 Don't let me down 
 The flame at the heart of a pawnbrokers diamond 
 Is a cold fire 
 Don't break the spell 
 The look in your eyes as you head for the door 
 Is a cold fire 
 I'll be around 
 If you don't let me down too far 
 I'll be around 
 If you don't let me down 
 I'll be around 
 If you don't push me down to far 
 I'll be around 
 If you don't push me down 
 I'll be around 
 If you don't let me down 
 It's a cold fire 
 Love is blind if you are gentle 
 It's a cold fire 
 It's a cold fire 
 Love can turn to a long cold burn"

 Dogs cry for the moon

 When all the bones are buried 
 There is barely time to go outside and play

 And the answer is automatic

131,Rush,rock,Earthshine,"On certain nights when the angles are right 
 And the moon is a slender crescent 
 Its circle shows in a ghostly glow 
 Of earthly luminescence 
 Earthshine, a beacon in the night 
 I can raise my eyes to earthshine 
 Earthshine, a jewel out of reach 
 For a dream to rise to earthshine 
 Floating high in the evening sky 
 I see my faint reflection 
 Pale facsimile, like what others see 
 When they look in my direction 
 Earthshine, a beacon in the night 
 I can raise my eyes to earthshine 
 Earthshine, stretching out your hand 
 Full of starlit diamonds, earthshine 
 Reflected light to another sight 
 And the moon tells a lover's story 
 My borrowed face and my third-hand grace 
 Only reflect your glory 
 Earthshine, stretching out your hand 
 I can raise my eyes to earthshine 
 Earthshine, you're still out of reach 
 For a dream to rise to earthshine 
 For a dream to rise to earthshine"

 I was standing on a reef 
 When the tide came in 
 Swept beneath the surface 
 Lost without a trace 
 No hope at all 
 No hope at all 
 Oh - sweet miracle 
 Oh - sweet miracle 
 Of life 
 I wasn't walking with angels 
 I was talking to myself 
 Rising up to the surface 
 Raging against the night 
 Starless night 
 Oh - sweet miracle 
 Love's sweet miracle 
 Of life 
 Oh salvation

 I wasn't praying for magic 
 I was hiding in plain sight 
 Rising up from the surface 
 To fly into the light"
133,Rush,rock,Nocturne,"Did I have a dream? 
 Or did the dream have me? 
 Set off on a night-sea journey 
 Without memory or desire 
 Drifting through lost latitudes 
 With no compass and no chart 
 Flying through hallucination 
 Distant voices, signal fires 
 Lighting up my unconscious 
 And the secret places of the heart 
 Dream - Temporary madness 
 Dream - A voice in the wilderness 
 Dream - Unconscious revelations 
 The morning says, the answer is yes 
 Floating through a darkened mirror 
 Deep reflections in disguise 
 Soaring through lost altitudes 
 Without wonder, without fear 
 Symbols on a field of visions 
 Behind the curtain of sleeping eyes 
 On the instant of waking 
 Another world of dreams appears 
 Dream - A walk in the wilderness 
 Dream - Unconscious recreation 
 The morning says, the answer is yes"
134,Rush,rock,"Freeze (Part IV Of ""Fear"")","The city crouches, steaming 
 In the early morning half-light 
 The sun is still a rumor 
 And the night is still a threat 
 Slipping through the dark streets 
 And the echoes and the shadows 
 Something stirs behind me 
 And my palms begin to sweat 
 Sometimes I freeze - until the light comes 
 Sometimes I fly - into the night 
 Sometimes I fight - against the darkness 
 Sometimes I'm wrong - sometimes I'm right 
 Coiled for the spring 
 Or caught like a creature in the headlights 
 Into a desperate panic 
 Or a tempest of blind fury 
 Like a cornered beast 
 Or a conquering hero 
 The menace threatens, closing 
 And I'm frozen in the shadows 
 I'm not prepared to run away 
 And I'm not prepared to fight 
 I can stand to reason 
 Or surrender to a reflex 
 I will trust my instincts 
 Or surrender to my fright 
 Sometimes we freeze - until the light comes 
 Sometimes we're wrong - and sometimes we're right 
 Sometimes we fight - against the darkness 
 Sometimes we fly - into the night 
 Blood running cold 
 Mind going down into a dark night 
 Of a desperate panic 
 Or a tempest of blind fury 
 Like a cornered beast 
 Or a conquering hero 
 Sometimes I freeze 
 Sometimes I fight 
 Sometimes I fly 
 Into the night"

 It's attraction 
 It's not a style 
 It's an action 
 It's a dream for the waking 
 It's a flower touched by flame 
 It's a gift for the giving 
 It's a power with a hundred names 
 Surge of energy, spark of inspiration 
 The breath of love is electricity 
 Maybe Time is a bird in flight 
 Endlessly mocking 
 Here we come out of the cradle 
 Endlessly rocking 
 Endlessly rocking 
 It's the hand 
 That rocks the cradle 
 It's the motion 
 That swings the sky 
 It's method on the edge of madness 
 It's a balance on the edge of a knife 
 It's a smile on the edge of sadness 
 It's a dance on the edge of life 
 Endlessly rocking"

 Singing songs and they carrying signs 
 Mostly say, hooray for our side

 It starts when you're always afraid

 For the thought that I caught that my head is the event of the season 
 Why in crowds just a trace of my face could seem so pleasin' 
 I'll cop out to the change, but a stranger is putting the tease on 
 I was down on a frown when the messenger brought me a letter 
 I was raised by the praise of a fan who said I upset her 
 Any girl in the world could have easily known me better 
 She said you're strange, but don't change, and I let her 
 In a while, will the smile on my face turn to plaster 
 Stick around while the clown who is sick does the trick of disaster 
 For the race of my head and my face is moving much faster 
 Is it strange I should change I don't know, why don't you ask her 
 Is it strange I should change I don't know, why don't you ask her 
 Is it strange I should change I don't know, why don't you ask her"

 Come tomorrow, may be a soldier 
 Come tomorrow, may I be bolder than today? 
 Now the trees are almost green 
 But will they still be seen? 
 When time and tide have been 
 Come tomorrow, will I be older? 
 Come tomorrow, may be a soldier 
 Come tomorrow, may I be bolder than today

145,Rush,rock,Armor And Sword,"[Break] 
 The snakes and arrows a child is heir to 
 Are enough to leave a thousand cuts 
 We build our defenses, a place of safety 
 And leave the darker places unexplored 
 Sometimes the fortress is too strong 
 Or the love is too weak 
 What should have been our armor 
 Becomes a sharp and angry sword 
 Our better natures seek elevation 
 A refuge for the coming night 
 No one gets to their heaven without a fight 
 No one 
 We hold beliefs as a consolation 
 A way to take us out of ourselves 
 Meditation or medication 
 A comfort, or a promised reward 
 Sometimes the spirit is too strong 
 Or the flesh is too weak 
 Sometimes the need is just too great 
 For the solace we seek 
 The suit of shining armor 
 Becomes a keen and bloody sword 
 No one gets to their heaven without a fight 
 A refuge for the coming night 
 A future of eternal light 
 No one gets to their heaven without a fight 
 No one 
 Confused alarms of struggle and flight 
 Blood is drained of color 
 By the flashes of artillery light 
 No one gets to their heaven without a fight 
 The battle flags are flown 
 At the feet of a god unknown 
 No one gets to their heaven 
 No one gets to their heaven without a fight 
 Sometimes the damage is too great 
 Or the will is too weak 
 What should have been our armor 
 Becomes a sharp and burning sword 
 No one gets to their heaven without a fight 
 A refuge for the coming night 
 A future of eternal light 
 No one gets to their heaven without a fight 
 No one 
 No one gets to their heaven without a fight"

 Riding and driving and living 
 So close to the edge

 Workin' them angels - overtime 
 Riding through the range of light to the wounded city 
 Filling my spirit with the wildest wish to fly 
 Oh taking the high road, taking that high road to the wounded city 
 Memory strumming at the heart of a moving picture 
 All this time 
 I've been workin' them angels overtime 
 Riding and diving and flying 
 Just over the edge

 Workin' them angels 
 Workin' them angels - overtime 
 Driving down the razor's edge 'tween the past and the future 
 Oh, turn up the music and smile 
 Get carried away on the songs and stories of vanished times 
 Memory drumming at the heart of an English winter 
 Memories beating at the heart of an African village

154,Rush,rock,We Hold On,"How many times 
 Do we tire of all the little battles 
 Threaten to call it quits 
 Tempted to cut and run 
 How many times 
 Do we weather out the stormy evenings 
 Long to slam the front door 
 Drive away into the setting sun 
 Keep going until dawn 
 How many times must another line be drawn 
 We could be down and gone 
 But we hold on 
 Keep going until dawn 
 How many times must another line be drawn 
 We could be down and gone 
 But we hold on 
 How many times 
 Do we chafe against the repetition 
 Straining against a fate 
 Measured out in coffee breaks 
 How many times 
 Do we swallow our ambition 
 Long to give up the same old way 
 Find another road to take 
 Keep going until dawn 
 How many times must another line be drawn 
 We could be down and gone 
 But we hold on 
 Keep holding on so long 
 'Cause there's a chance 
 That we might not be so wrong 
 We could be down and gone 
 But we hold on 
 How many times 
 Do we wonder if it's even worth it 
 There's got to be some other way 
 Way to get me through the day 
 Keep going until dawn 
 How many times must another line be drawn 
 We could be down and gone 
 But we hold on 
 Keep going until dawn 
 How many times must another line be drawn 
 We could be down and gone 
 But we hold on"

 The universe has a plan 
 We are only human

 The universe has a plan 
 All is for the best 
 Some will be rewarded 
 And the devil will take the rest 
 All is for the best

 Blind men in the market 
 Buying what we're sold 
 Believe in what we're told 
 Until our final breath 
 While our loving Watchmaker 
 Loves us all to death 
 In a world of cut and thrust 
 I was always taught to trust 
 In a world where all must fail 
 Heaven's justice will prevail 
 The joy and pain that we receive 
 Each comes with its own cost 
 The price of what we're winning 
 Is the same as what we've lost 
 All is for the best 
 Believe in what we're told 
 Blind men in the market 
 Buying what we're sold 
 Believe in what we're told

 Must be what we deserve

 Loves us all to... 
 Loves us all to death"
156,Rush,rock,Caravan,"In a world lit only by fire 
 Long train of flares 
 Under piercing stars 
 I stand watching the steam-liners roll by 
 The caravan thunders onward 
 To the distant dream of the city 
 The caravan carries me onward 
 On my way at last, on my way at last 
 I can't stop thinking big 
 I can't stop thinking big 
 I can't stop thinking big 
 I can't stop thinking big 
 On a road lit only by fire 
 Going where I want 
 Instead of where I should 
 I peer out at the passing shadows 
 Carried through the night into the city 
 Where a young man has 
 A chance of making good 
 A chance to break from the past 
 The caravan thunders onward 
 Stars winking through the canvas hood 
 The caravan thunders onward 
 On my way at last, on my way at last 
 I can't stop thinking big 
 I can't stop thinking big 
 I can't stop thinking big 
 I can't stop thinking big 
 I can't stop thinking big 
 I can't stop thinking big 
 In a world where I feel so small 
 I can't stop thinking big 
 I can't stop thinking big 
 I can't stop thinking big 
 I can't stop thinking big 
 I can't stop thinking big 
 I can't stop thinking big 
 I can't stop thinking big 
 In a world where I feel so small 
 I can't stop thinking big"
157,Rush,rock,Clockwork Angels,"High above the city square 
 Globes of light float in mid-air 
 Higher still, against the night 
 Clockwork angels bathed in light 
 You promise every treasure, to the foolish and the wise 
 Goddesses of mystery, spirits in disguise 
 Every pleasure, we bow and close our eyes 
 Clockwork angels, promise every prize 
 Clockwork angels, spread their arms and sing 
 Synchronized and graceful, they move like living things 
 Goddesses of Light, of Sea and Sky and Land 
 Clockwork angels, the people raise their hands - as if to fly 
 As if to fly 
 All around the city square 
 Power shimmers in the air 
 People gazing up with love 
 To those angels high above 
 Celestial machinery - move through your commands 
 Goddesses of mystery, so delicate and so grand 
 Moved to worship, we bow and close our eyes 
 Clockwork angels, promise every prize 
 Clockwork angels, spread their arms and sing 
 Synchronized and graceful, they move like living things 
 Goddesses of Light, of Sea and Sky and Land 
 Clockwork angels, the people raise their hands - as if to fly 
 As if to fly 
 Lean not upon your own understanding 
 Ignorance is well and truly blessed 
 Trust in perfect love, and perfect planning 
 Everything will turn out for the best 
 And everything will turn out for the best 
 Stars aglow like scattered sparks 
 Span the sky in clockwork arcs 
 Hit at more than we can see 
 Spiritual machinery 
 Clockwork angels, spread their arms and sing 
 Synchronized and graceful, they move like living things 
 Goddesses of Light, of Sea and Sky and Land 
 Clockwork angels, the people raise their hands

 ""What do you lack?"""
158,Rush,rock,The Anarchist,"Will there be world enough and time for me to sing that song? 
 A voice so silent for so long 
 For all those years I had to get along, they told me I was wrong 
 I never wanted to belong - I was so strong 
 I lack their smiles and their diamonds, I lack their happiness and love 
 I envy them for all those things, I never got my fair share of 
 My fair share of 
 The lenses inside of me that paint the world black 
 The pools of poison, the scarlet mist, that spill over into rage 
 The things I've always been denied 
 An early promise that somehow died 
 A missing part of me that grows around me like a cage 
 A missing part of me that grows around me like a cage 
 In all your science of the mind, seeking blind through flesh and bone 
 Find the blood inside this stone 
 What I know, I've never shown, what I feel, I've always known 
 I plan my vengeance on my own - and I was always alone 
 I lack their smiles and their diamonds, I lack their happiness and love 
 I envy them for all those things, I never got my fair share of 
 My fair share of 
 The lenses inside of me that paint the world black 
 The pools of poison, the scarlet mist, that spill over into rage 
 The things I've always been denied 
 An early promise that somehow died 
 A missing part of me that grows around me like a cage 
 A missing part of me that grows around me like a cage 
 Oh - they tried to get me 
 Oh - they'll never forget me 
 The lenses inside of me that paint the world black 
 The pools of poison, the scarlet mist, that spill over into rage 
 The things I've always been denied 
 An early promise that somehow died 
 A missing part of me that grows around me like a cage 
 A missing part of me that grows around me like a cage 
 A missing part of me that grows around me like a cage"
159,Rush,rock,Carnies,"Under the gaze of the angels 
 A spectacle like he's never seen 
 Spinning lights and faces 
 Demon music and gypsy queens 
 The glint of iron wheels 
 The bodies spin in a clockwork dance 
 The smell of flint and steel 
 A wheel of fate, a game of chance 
 How I prayed just to get away 
 To carry me anywhere 
 Sometimes the angels punish us 
 By answering our prayers 
 By answering our prayers 
 A face of naked evil 
 Turns the young boy's blood to ice 
 The deadly confrontation 
 Such a dangerous device 
 The glint of iron wheels 
 The bodies spin in a clockwork dance 
 The smell of flint and steel 
 A wheel of fate, a game of chance 
 Shout to warn the crowd 
 Accusations ringing loud 
 A ticking box, in the hand of the innocent 
 The angry crowd moves toward him with bad intent 
 How I prayed just to get away 
 To carry me anywhere 
 Sometimes the angels punish us 
 By answering our prayers 
 By answering our prayers 
 The glint of iron wheels 
 The bodies spin in a clockwork dance 
 The smell of flint and steel 
 A wheel of fate, a game of chance"
160,Rush,rock,Halo Effect,"What did I see? 
 Fool that I was 
 Oh a goddess, with wings on her heels 
 All my illusions 
 Projected on her 
 The ideal that I wanted to see 
 What did I know? 
 Fool that I was 
 Oh little by little, I learned 
 My friends were dismayed 
 To see me betrayed 
 But they knew they could never tell me 
 What did I care? 
 Fool that I was 
 Oh little by little, I burned 
 Maybe sometimes 
 There might be a flaw 
 But how pretty the picture was back then 
 What did I do? 
 Fool that I was 
 To profit from youthful mistakes? 
 It's shameful to tell 
 How often I fell 
 In love with illusions again 
 What did I do? 
 The fool that I was 
 To profit from youthful mistakes? 
 So shameful to tell 
 Just how often I fell 
 In love with illusions again 
 A goddess with wings on her heels..."
161,Rush,rock,Seven Cities Of Gold,"A man can lose his past, in a country like this 
 Wandering aimless 
 Parched and nameless 
 A man could lose his way, in a country like this 
 Canyons and cactus 
 Endless and trackless 
 Searching through a grim eternity 
 Sculptured by a prehistoric sea 
 Seven cities of gold 
 With stones that fired my imagination 
 Seven cities of gold 
 A splendid mirage in this desolation 
 Seven cities of gold 
 Glowing in my dreams, like hallucinations 
 Glitter in the sun like a revelation 
 Distant as a comet or a constellation 
 A man can lose himself, in a country like this 
 Rewrite the story 
 Recapture the glory 
 A man could lose his life, in a country like this 
 Sunblind and friendless 
 Frozen and endless 
 And the nights grow longer, the farther I go 
 Wake to aching cold, and a deep Sahara of snow 
 Seven cities of gold 
 With stones that fired my imagination 
 Seven cities of gold 
 A splendid mirage in this desolation 
 Seven cities of gold 
 Glowing in my dreams, like hallucinations 
 Glitter in the sun like a revelation 
 Distant as a comet or a constellation 
 Oh that gleam in the distance could be heaven's gate 
 A long-awaited treasure at the end of my cruel fate 
 Seven cities of gold 
 With stones that fired my imagination 
 Seven cities of gold 
 A splendid mirage in this desolation 
 Seven cities of gold 
 Glowing in my dreams, like hallucinations 
 Glitter in the sun like a revelation 
 Distant as a comet or a constellation"
162,Rush,rock,The Wreckers,"The breakers roar on an unseen shore 
 In the teeth of a hurricane 
 Oh we struggle in vain 
 A hellish night - a ghostly light 
 Appears through the driving rain 
 Salvation in a human chain 
 All I know is that sometimes you have to be wary 
 Of a mircale too good to be true 
 All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary 
 Everything in life you thought you knew 
 All I know is that sometimes you have to be wary 
 'Cause sometimes the target is you 
 Driven aground, with that awful sound 
 Drowned by the cheer from ashore 
 Oh we wonder what for 
 The people swarm through the darkling storm 
 Gather everything they can score 
 'Til their backs won't bear any more 
 All I know is that sometimes you have to be wary 
 Of a mircale too good to be true 
 All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary 
 Everything in life you thought you knew 
 All I know is that sometimes you have to be wary 
 'Cause sometimes the target is you 
 The breakers roar on an unseen shore 
 In the teeth of an icy grave 
 In the teeth of an icy grave 
 Oh the human chain leaves a bloody stain 
 Washed away in the pounding waves 
 Washed away in the pounding waves 
 All I know is that sometimes you have to be wary 
 Of a mircale too good to be true 
 All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary 
 Everything in life you thought you knew 
 All I know is that sometimes you have to be wary 
 'Cause sometimes the target is you 
 All I know is that memory can be too much to carry 
 Striking down like a bolt from the blue 
 All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary 
 Everything in life you thought you knew 
 All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary 
 'Cause sometimes the target is you"
163,Rush,rock,Headlong Flight,"All the journeys of this great adventure 
 It didn't always feel that way 
 I wouldn't trade them

 Some nights were bright 
 I wish that I could live it all again

164,Rush,rock,BU2B2,"I was brought up to believe 
 Belief has failed me now 
 The bright glow of optimism 
 Abandoned me somehow 
 Belief has failed me now 
 Life goes from bad to worse 
 No philosophy consoles me 
 In a clockwork universe 
 Oh life goes from bad to worse 
 I still choose to live 
 Find the measure of love and laughter 
 And another measure to give 
 Oh I still choose to live 
 And give, even while I grieve 
 Though the balance tilts against me 
 I was brought up to believe"

 It is what it is - and whatever 
 Time is still the infinite jest 
 The arrow flies when you dream, the hours tick away - the cells tick away 
 The Watchmaker keeps to his schemes 
 The hours tick away - they tick away 
 The measure of a life is a measure of love and respect 
 So hard to earn, so easily burned 
 The measure of a life is a measure of love and respect 
 So hard to earn, so easily burned

 Oh it is what it is - and forever 
 Each moment a memory in flight 
 The arrow flies while you breathe, the hours tick away - the cells tick away 
 The Watchmaker has time up his sleeve 
 The hours tick away - they tick away 
 The measure of a life is a measure of love and respect 
 So hard to earn, so easily burned 
 In the fullness of time 
 A garden to nurture and protect 
 (It's a measure of a life) 
 The treasure of a life is a measure of love and respect 
 The way you live, the gifts that you give 
 In the fullness of time 
 It's the only return that you expect 
 The future disappears into memory 
 With only a moment between 
 Forever dwells in that moment 
 Hope is what remains to be seen 
 Forever dwells in that moment
