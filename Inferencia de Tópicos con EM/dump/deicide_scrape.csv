 Wandering receivers of a sacrifice

 Beneath the seven cities dead 
 Encased in silent tombs 
 Immortally exhumed

 Still to life and yet they breathe 
 Dead but dreaming...

 Through the gates into lands I know not 
 On the road where none have returned 
 Come to life, Oh lords of black earth 
 Screaming ancient incantations 
 Sleep unbinded by my sight

 Born to be dead 
 Repent to die 
 Waste your last breath on the lord Jesus Christ 
 Repent to die 
 Afraid of what lies after death 
 Your screams are unheard to Him 
 Resisting your wake of adorn 
 Your pleading falls deaf on your lord 
 ""Go fuck your god"" will be my final words 
 To die is just the concept of living 
 To be Forgave, salvation blessed with pain 
 Endeavored is the blame of creation

31,Deicide,metal,This Is Hell We're In,"Racing with death, life in a mess 
 Time growing shorter with every regret 
 Efforts subceeding, I'm losing restrain 
 Insincere promise I've broken again 
 Nothing can touch me for once I am dead 
 Exclude the body, the spirit is left 
 I have no problem in coping with life 
 It is this world that condemns me to die 
 This is hell we're in 
 Enduring in pain 
 In this hell we're in 
 I will not remain 
 This is hell we're in 
 Forbidden to want 
 From this hell we're in 
 I wish to move on 
 Wrapped in self doubt enmeshed in the brain 
 Darkest depression succumbing again 
 Waiting the hour, the string snaps inside 
 Length of a second to take my own life 
 So it is promised I do not believe 
 Anything better than what I have seen 
 Out of this body, I wait for this day 
 In this hell were in, entangled in pain 
 Balance upset into leaning on death 
 Simplified option to life's little test 
 Constantly guarding against its attack 
 Why were we put here to feel its effect 
 Violent pressure has tired my tries 
 It is my wish that it's soon that I die 
 Hanging by threads to the realms of the sane 
 It is this world that has made me this way"
32,Deicide,metal,I Am No One,"I'm your forsaken, the fallen from grace 
 Horror of evil, created mistake 
 Ruthless and wicked, I feast with the damned 
 I am the cyst on your lord's holy lamb 
 Fuck your religion with blood on its hands 
 Forgive the savior, forget about man 
 Profits for heaven build kingdoms of greed 
 Whoring redempter, embezzle the weak 
 I am no one, without me he's unknown 
 Darkness gives power to light up his throne 
 Descend on earth in angelic display 
 The time has come to undo his restrains 
 I'm the temptation that swallowed his eve 
 God's inhibition leave nothing to see 
 Hatred and anger conceived from the dust 
 I am the shame and the filth of their lust 
 Forfeit the savior for cleansing of sins 
 Relive the site of his crucifixion 
 Tragedy follows the wealth of your faith 
 Holy disorder has fell into place 
 Banished from heaven, unsatisfied soul 
 Out of the way of Jehovah's control 
 Let upon earth to envoke its decay 
 The time has come for your god to take blame"
33,Deicide,metal,Slave To The Cross,"Killing, blood spilling for faith in your god 
 Spreading the message defending his fraud 
 Murder unheard of until their belief 
 Rape of the willing is blessed by the priest 
 Travel to new worlds enslaved under god 
 Destroy their cultures then leave them to rot 
 Purification, consent to concede 
 Killing the ones who will never believe 
 Annihilation, convert to the cross 
 Civilization all under one god 
 Slave to the cross 
 Slave to the cross 
 Splitting masses indivision 
 Genocidal inquisition 
 Unified through their religion 
 Wreck this world with heaven's wisdom 
 Reign of the cross, the aggressor 
 Has killed more people than cancer 
 Slave to the cross of deception 
 When will we stop his infection

 Terrify into religion 
 Recify the church ambition 
 Crucify who will not listen

 Why do you think you'll get something for free 
 Look in yourself, is it worth what you said 
 It may be you who comes turning up dead 
 Lives are worth nothing unless you have something to gain 
 Loath in assumption, you really should watch what you say 
 When you are wrong it is all just a part of a game 
 Creatures of habit, the bullshit is always the same 
 Eye for an eye, applaud when you die 
 Shit on your grave for the rest of my life 
 Faces of two will divide for control 
 You are the pawns in this world all alone 
 Creatures of habit, to cease to exist 
 Now that it's over you'll get what you give 
 Creatures of habit, I daydream you dead 
 Choking the life from you with my bare hands 
 What in the world is becoming of greed 
 Why do you wish to continue this dream 
 Look at myself, isn't worth what I'm dealt 
 This may be for you but I'm getting out 
 Unfair decision you try to impose out of spite 
 In their own interest they care and pretend to be nice 
 I will not have it and now that I've opened my eyes 
 Creatures of habit, I have no respect for your kind"

 Hypnotized by his infliction 
 Go to him, he is your savior 
 Leave this place, do us a favor 
 Believe the lie of a god you'll never know 
 Prepare to die when you least expect to go 
 A desperate mind will ignore reality 
 The word of Christ has you lost in fantasy 
 Believe the lie to reside with him in death 
 Conserve to buy into what he's promising 
 Don't be so blind not to mind hypocrisy 
 You just might find what you want can never be 
 Take your life, be a true christian 
 For the lies of his existence 
 Sacrifice rendered unable 
 Book of god, it is a fable 
 Believe the lie to return from which we came 
 The serpent's light has you mesmerized again 
 When faith decides suicide at heaven's whim 
 Believe the lie, you are saved from all your sins 
 When is life worth a religion 
 Ease your mind, make the incision 
 Prey to him, incoming stranger 
 Son of god dead in the manger"

 Not his child, christians in denial 
 His rule undone, we are their creation 
 The truth above does not know your savior 
 Unidentified evolution 
 Fallen truth, break the god illusion 
 Out of faith will revive with reason 
 Synchronize this world we live in 
 The truth coming will destroy his story 
 Not of this earth, we are part of research 
 Christian hunted, end of god confronted 
 The truth above, we are part who they are 
 Key to life is the question answered 
 Fly into never known advancement 
 Out of ignorance running rampant 
 Sterilizing us from disaster"

 Believe in god or be beaten to death 
 Work to earn your keep, no time to sleep 
 You better know the bible verse 
 Or go without and die of thirst 
 Resent your birth - thanks to god! 
 At Father Baker's the pain is divine 
 If you are lucky you'll get out alive 
 Welcome to terror, you're where you belong 
 Father is waiting to show you your wrong 
 Learn early on to behave or you'll die 
 Live with his torture, no one to confide 
 Innocence lost by the rage he inflicts 
 Repent to god or the pain will persist 
 Kept inside a cage, humiliate 
 Till Father takes confession 
 Whipped unmercifully and left to bleed 
 And by the end to be one with god 
 Fast you into place, the final phase 
 Before you meet his maker 
 Do as you are told or you will go 
 And then you'll know what is suffering"

 Where is your power to make me redeem 
 If you're so mighty then why not kill me 
 Adore the serpent created by god 
 Once that you do this then you can move on 
 Making us pure with the death of your son

 Behind these eyes there is nothing to see 
 Abominated by my choice to blaspheme 
 Demonic forces overriding control 
 The time predicted and the hour foretold 
 Where is the fear that keeps you closer to god? 
 Then I appear and you wish I would be gone 
 Covered in terror far beyond your belief 
 Never existed, am I only a dream?

 The kingdom of Jehovah isn't really there... 
 Halls of warship burn, until you touch the ground 
 Ignited by deceit, your will of god is misperceived 
 Where's the virtue in the riddles of a dying king 
 Exiled in defeat, the end of their regime 
 They know who rules this world, a toll they sue to scare 
 Brainwash the witnesses to think he's coming here 
 Their only mission is the pending fear of god 
 Given permission to pursue a life without 
 A grim existence for the offspring that they breed 
 Return to Abraham and let us live in peace

 Preach your hell and you will see 
 You are your worst enemy 
 The lord is dead, Jesus, where have you gone? 
 Retreat to greed, indeed, you are his son 
 Prepare for death, confess, is it pretend? 
 Killing yourselves for god, he is your friend? 
 All you life a testament, walking ornament of him 
 Is forgiveness what you need, give in to hymn too easily 
 Indecision you behold, live in torment as you're told 
 Sanctify this will of god by everything you've ever done 
 Will you ever know defeat, blinded by the agony 
 Never sure of what you feel, the world you live in is not real

 The Devil is coming for you 
 Intervention, the retreat has begun 
 Although you're all about to be dead 
 You in the front, the first to go 
 I think it was in something you said 
 You claim to be the son 
 Your pain for everyone 
 To heaven disappear 
 Apocalyptic fear 
 Perfect the method for an untimely death 
 The horror you're about to receive 
 Firestorm, incinerator engaged 
 You want the sacrifice to be seen 
 Consequences for your misuse of god 
 Without the final seal, you are through 
 Convinced of what has to be done

 Insist it's the only way out 
 The only chance you have to be free 
 Defend your impeccable lord

 If I find salvation and the book of hymns 
 Their annihilation will not get me in 
 Expose god religion to my dying death 
 Cannot be forgiven by your holiness 
 Will I learn my lesson, bare their sympathy? 
 Answer to your question - that ain't happening 
 Bow before no god that cannot be seen 
 And wants to show mercy on people like me 
 Facing their judgment to settle the score 
 Refusal of penance, I laugh at your lord 
 Grace of god refusal, evil to the end 
 Instrument of Satan, I have always been 
 Challenge my conviction to the Baphomet 
 Smash his crucifixion right against your head 
 Contents under pressure explode, kill your ass 
 Total devastation in the aftermath 
 I behold no penance, only dignity 
 In hell with Lord Satan for eternity 
 Bow before no god that cannot be seen

 Facing their judgment to settle the score 
 Refusal of penance, I laugh at your lord"

 Burning Christians begging pleas, satisfy my need to 
 Bleed, trample on the lambs of god, bow before thy lord

 Screaming help and over come you can't believe what's going on, 
 Blacking out his light of hate, I take away the lord restraint, 
 Simplify the suffering, and reinvent the world I loathe, 
 Left to die in front of god, the Christian will not change what's done, 
 All for hymn and none for all, your final wishes reek of blood, 
 Atrophy deteriorate you give yourself to blasphemy, 
 Sacrilege called you here, and now you're ours and Christ don't care. 
 Live your life the way a Christian wants to, 
 Curse at god in vain his idle threats, 
 Fuck off Jesus we will never find you, 
 What you said has cost the world unrest. 
 Raise the sword of Lucifer, and cast your soul into the night 
 New found wisdom has enlightened you beyond the holy might, 
 Never reach a final path, achieve a higher place than that, 
 Me inside the one I trust, and never would I plead with god, 
 Stifled image crucifixion bore the child with religion, 
 Insulate their sense of faith; devote the soul without a trace,

 Lascivious redemption, justify thy vile absence 
 Propagate his aggression as you use his words as weapons 
 Lies now have you lost, the worthless cause of the crucifixion 
 The sanctity, to hang and bleed, and in the form of a human cross 
 Blind by prophecy, his Bible fiend, a bloody sword of his fantasy 
 Tried for heresy, and sacrilege, to bare the scars of the crucifix 
 You walk alone with Jesus, in a world of non-believers 
 Humiliated savior, is thy son of Heaven's failure 
 For ever left undone, on the cross for everyone 
 His words of God unheard, he is dead and not concerned 
 God fatality, the life recedes on the cross of his sign 
 Finality, in search of peace, to beg and plead for the end that will be 
 The light descends, when suffering, impaled again for your blasphemous lies 
 Resented death, his sins confessed, accept the scars of the crucifix"

 His belief in us long been said and gone, in our age where there is no fear of god, 
 I forsake you and I hate you holy one give us life just to take it when were done. 
 Behead you with the bible, the book of god and failing son, 
 There is no resurrection for god has left us to Satan,

 Mad at god for the things he's done to me, for this life of regrets and his agony, 
 In his name I do blame and wish his death, all my life has been pain and nothing else, 
 Curse you god for the life you left me with, Everyday is a fight to want to live, 
 Cross of Christ I despise and hate the lord, Mad at god for the world he has ignored. 
 My life is not religion, salvation or his bastard son, 
 Annihilate the bible; remove it from this world at once, 
 In total desecration, the house of god has been destroyed, 
 At last the truth will triumph, free will and blasphamation. 
 I hate you lord, forgot I exist, resent your ways that will not be forgived, 
 Waller in hatred I blame you for all, slashing and stabbing your Christians I maul, 
 Mad at god revenge in my heart wanting you dead will never depart, 
 When I was born, marked with your cross, only to suffer and deal with my loss, 
 Dead in my thoughts prey to myself, not to show mercy for nobody else, 
 I am for me, need not from god, my heart is stone and will never be loved. 
 Mad at god and mad at you, believing in something that cannot be true, 
 Think for yourself, free from his lies, trample the cross and smash Jesus Christ. 
 Die!

 Destroying innocence the church of sodomy. 
 Man of the cloth with no conscious of sin, 
 Now on the run from the crucifixion, 
 No longer trusted and never again, 
 Conquered by Sodom your fall is our win. 
 At last the world can see your secrets are no more, 
 Evading punishment behind the catholic doors. 
 Your time has come to pass and now forever be. 
 Revenge is on the minds of all you have besieged. 
 The walls of god lay ruin, by his own demand. 
 Stricken from sanctity, and with no flock to tend, 
 Religion slowly rotting, in it's shallow grave, 
 Pursuing self-indulgence, holy men of faith. 
 Conquest of flesh has condemned you to death, 
 Destroy the trust of the congregation.

 Conquered by Sodom, in league with Satan"

 Christians are weak and the bible is beaten 
 Homage to God, in this world not needed 
 Fuck your god an his annals of plague 
 Falling apart and exposing the light

 He did not die to protect or save me 
 There is just blood in his book of deceiving 
 Riddles and crap to his divine healing 
 Fail is your faith and you blame it on Satan

 Not a slave to religion unrendered 
 Falsified god and his Christ redempters 
 Never to be in the presence of grandeur

 End of god, when heaven burns it will fall to the earth, 
 Watch it burn angels on fire and screaming berserk, 
 Holy ghost, lost in confusion and puking in pain, 
 When it burns pissing on prophets that fall to the flame.

 Slowly it kills you, and without a sound, evil upon you forever and on,

 From darkness come, I will stab and beat him 
 Beyond belief, in god, don't prey for me, Christian stu-pi-dity 
 I spite his word, with truth, for all to learn, worthless fragility, 
 From birth, scheming, I search, and spread the word, 
 Satan is on the earth. 
 The end of god, destroyed; is all I want, kill him, from darkness come, 
 Get down on to my knees I won't for any thing, 
 Nor am I filled with the spirit heavens love. 
 It makes no sense to me, holy philosophies, 
 Ravaged by years of his threats and hypocrisies.

95,Deicide,metal,Godkill,"Heaven reviled conspire deceit, 
 Revelled in heinous reward, 
 Wiping out missions who faltered and fiend, 
 Turning your back to the wants of the lord... 
 Destroying all Christians of faith and belief, 
 Plaguing infection and pain, 
 Taunting his vision for everything lost, 
 Collapse the world in a righteous display, 
 Impending death for partaking in blasphemy, 
 The end to all for he ones who will not believe, 
 Evading time and discard to entitlement, 
 A wailing wall of destruction of innocence... 
 Godkill, Godkill 
 Killing his own and avoiding defeat, 
 Ravage the word from his throne, 
 Willfully murder with conscious and ease, 
 Spilling the blood of the young and the old, 
 Slaughtered and scattered the end is imposed 
 Doomed by the rage of his grace, 
 Future of sorrow defending his name, 
 No one or nothing will ever be saved... 
 Destroy the will of a lord who waits your death 
 Bring forth the end to the threats and his sacraments. 
 Father far from hell, 
 Master of all, spare none of thy wrath, 
 Destroy this world... 
 Godkill, Godkill 
 Misery falling from heaven above, 
 Splendor exploding unfazed, 
 No more tomorrow impaled nazarene, 
 Bury the book and along with this name... 
 God and religion a future unknown, 
 Darkness uncovered his word, 
 Rebuke his call and expulsion of guilt, 
 Think for yourself and just do as thou wilt."
96,Deicide,metal,Beyond Salvation,"The blood of Christ quenches my thirst... 
 Heavenly led, cast to the dead 
 If you believe the illusion 
 Died for your sins, dissension begins 
 The powers of Christ will repel you 
 Masses deceived, fall to temptation 
 Thorns on your head, welcome 
 Welcome to your death 
 We're beyond salvation 
 Below the reach of god 
 The end of all religion 
 To fight the war as one 
 Blasphemy, engaging in war 
 Rapture the whore 
 We're beyond salvation 
 Below the reach of god 
 Invert the false messiah 
 And desecrate the son 
 Deny the cross 
 Jesus has lost 
 Stopped and I stare, stones in the air 
 A witness to your execution 
 No one repents as they're watching you die 
 Death to the kingdom of heaven."
97,Deicide,metal,Misery Of One,"Failure, claim to fame, abject the soul, ending your own dream, 
 You closed that door! 
 The end of time has come for you and him are done, 
 Dissension has begun the misery of one. 
 Liars, petty thieves, out for their own, sadness turn to grief, the truth now known. Now take your place with god, unburdened by your thought, you got just what you want, a life of pain and loss. 
 Dooming oneself for one selfish belief, 
 Only yourself by yourself was deceived, nobody wants to remember your name, only what if's now remain in your place, seen for the fraud that you put on display, live with your actions while digging your grave, choke on the truth, slap to the face, life without you is a much better place. 
 A wish of death, no hope for happiness, 
 The flame of wealth, no more of yours to delve, 
 Concurred defeat is all you'll ever reach, 
 Embraced your hell, as long as time will tell. 
 Failure, claim to fame, abject your souls, ending your own dreams, you closed that door! The end of time has come for you and him are done, dissension has begun in misery as one."
98,Deicide,metal,Between The Flesh And The Void,"Death, I wait the pain 
 A stare that's cold and burns my eyes 
 Victim, deception 
 Death to your shrine 
 Those I've lost appear before me 
 The end of life, the air turning colder 
 I close my eyes and brace for eternity 
 Prevailing thoughts, a vanishing soul 
 Death, I wait the pain 
 A stare that's cold and burns my eyes 
 Victim, deception 
 Death to your shrine 
 My body decays, the skin falls away 
 Death to myself 
 Between the flesh and the void, 
 Between the flesh and the void 
 Death, I wait the pain 
 A stare that's cold and burns my eyes 
 Victim, deception 
 Death to your shrine 
 My body decays, the skin falls away 
 Death to myself 
 Between the flesh and the void, 
 No coming back, exit the soul 
 Imprisoned remain, 
 Between the flesh and the void."
99,Deicide,metal,Even The Gods Can Bleed,"I am the one spreading plague and disease 
 God cannot hear you, he is deaf to your pleas 
 Holy despair, overthrowing the lord 
 One with the devil all faith is destroyed 
 The end has begun, behold thy name 
 Defacing their idols and breaking their laws 
 Murdering Christ as I cripple the cross 
 No resurrection, dethroned Nazarene 
 Prayers go unanswered, succumb to defeat 
 Fallen from grace, bring an end to all things 
 Heavens disciples will fall to my rage 
 Devoured by faith, the illusion of god 
 Crucify Christ to the unholy one 
 The end has begun, behold thy name 
 Death to your god, the end has begun 
 The savior descend, divine suffering, 
 Invite the unknown despised and dethroned, 
 To fold in defeat, even the gods can bleed 
 The end has begun, behold thy name 
 Repent unto thee, even the gods can bleed 
 I am the one spreading plague and disease 
 God cannot hear you, he is deaf to your pleas 
 Holy despair, overthrowing the lord 
 One with the devil all faith is destroyed"
100,Deicide,metal,Trample The Cross,"Question the lord with a heart full of hate, 
 Speaking in tongues and fulfilling his faith, 
 Walking through fire alone and displaced, 
 All who defile the lord and his name... 
 Blasphemy unto thee, conquer all things, 
 Battered and beaten the cross of mystique, 
 Papal in ruin and brought to its knees, 
 See through religion and you will find peace... 
 Damning the souls of his praise, rapture begotten ill gain, 
 Crossing the light from divine, death to your god and his kind. 
 Bury the book in its grave, holy of holy's in flames 
 Worn and despised and diseased, trample the cross in defeat. 
 Darkness and evil and unholy dreams, 
 Go without mention and cannot be seen, 
 Do not assume what you don't want to know, 
 Christ and religion is only for show... 
 Fear has deflowered the lies of his faith, 
 Watching it die puts a smile on my face, 
 Holy ground crumble from under their feet, 
 Once and forever and ever shall be..."
101,Deicide,metal,Fallen To Silence,"Life of disgust, his fable you trust, a fool, you abide, 
 Hailing his vengeance and stripped of all senses, for god... you die, 
 Fallen to silence 
 Death and defiance 
 Destroying the feeble 
 Banished by evil 
 Defraud the meek their followers weak, and cower at his sign, 
 Truth of contention, deceit with intention, the heart, of the blind 
 Revival and crosses at one with your losses, and wonder, his lie 
 Unright with the facts, and there's no coming back, the light, denied 
 Fallen to silence 
 Death and defiance 
 Destroying the feeble 
 Banished by evil 
 Soul is consumed, the coming of doom, the bible you revive, 
 Blasphemy blessing, is faint and distressing, his words of Christ. 
 Blind to our death your creation a mess, prayers for your need are denied, blind to despair and your lord does not care, watching this world as it dies 
 Lack of reflection, with no interaction, the world will die, 
 You're only a ghost and refuse to invoke, the power of your Christ... 
 Fallen to silence 
 Death and defiance 
 Destroying the feeble 
 Banished by evil 
 Death to religion, a blind contradiction of life defied, 
 The cross of deception and book of infection the truth a lie."
102,Deicide,metal,Kill The Light Of Christ,"Death unfold, bleeding from my eyes, 
 Damn this soul, to the other side, 
 Conscious of sin, from this hell we're in, 
 Done with this life, brought here just to die, 
 Kill the light of Christ, truth is ours to find, 
 Trapped inside this shrine, all that lives will die 
 Grace of god, drowning in my blood, 
 All behold, kill us one by one 
 Anger betray, stifled and deceived, want of the Lord, that we will believe... 
 Kill the light of Christ, truth is ours to find 
 Trapped inside this shrine, flawed in his design, 
 Waiting till my time, all that lives will die 
 At the end of hope and loss the body will decease, destiny 
 Promising the afterlife to ease our suffering, suffering 
 Step into the outer reaches of the great unknown, all will die 
 Defect and deficient is the image of the lord... the lord 
 Kill the light of Christ, truth is ours to find, 
 Trapped inside this shrine, all that lives will die, 
 Left untold, to suffice his lie, 
 Spirit world, where we cross that line, 
 When it begins, will we live again, 
 Mired in death, into the abyss 
 Kill the light of Christ, truth is ours to find, 
 Trapped inside this shrine, flawed in his design, 
 No one will survive, all that lives will die"
103,Deicide,metal,End The Wrath Of God,"From the creation and beginning of man 
 With no explanation to his biblical plan 
 No longer needed for your god to exist 
 The call of temptation that no one can resist 
 Nullify resistance to control our lives 
 Sterilized creation, born to bear your lie 
 Mortified in madness by a man made god 
 The solitude of sadness the father and the son 
 End the wrath of god, End the wrath of god 
 There have been no prophets that speak the word of god 
 There is no salvation, delusions from above 
 Book of contradiction, the one that I despise 
 In the words of truth I speak, the lords of lords will die... 
 End the wrath of god... 
 Nullify resistance to control our lives 
 Sterilized creation, born to bear your lie 
 Mortified in madness by a man made god 
 The solitude of sadness the father and the son 
 Book of contradiction, the one that I despise 
 In the words of truth I speak, the lords of lords will die... 
 End the wrath of god, End the wrath of god 
 Book of contradiction, the one that I despise 
 In the words of truth I speak, the lords of lords will die..."
