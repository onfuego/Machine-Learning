0,Nicki Minaj,pop,Intro,"You know, a lot of people ask me 
 Why I feel, that, you know 
 I've gotten a lot of notoriety so quickly 
 And, umm, I don't know 
 People seem to be under the impression 
 That, I made it to this point, FAST 
 And, y'know obviously for me 
 I don't feel like that 'cause it's me y'know 
 I feel like I've been doing it, for ten billion years 
 But, every time someone says something like that to me 
 I remember to just thank God for, y'know, getting me this far 
 Cause sometimes you don't realize how far you've gotten 
 Until you look around and, and you look at the people who 
 Who, who are still trailing so far behind you 
 And I know that, that no matter what, it's 
 In the end it's not gonna be about my talent, y'know 
 It's not gonna be about my connections 
 It's not gonna be about my looks 
 It's, it's gonna be about, who wants it, the most 
 Annnnd, I want it the most!"

 If we in the oval office then the lights out 
 'Cause I am the wicked witch I'm the Nickster 
 And I keep a bad bitch on my jickster 
 But I leave her in a second for a thicker 
 Rockstar little mama with a guitar

 You know why? My tears have dried 
 And I know that no weapon formed 
 Against me will prosper. And I truly 
 Believe that my haters are my motivators 
 Young Money 
 If you could you would get rid of me 
 Fuck you gone do when a bitch try to go hard? 
 Bet I won't let you get to me (to me) 
 You should already figure I'ma go hard 
 If you was as real as me you would never 
 Let another girl sit in your throne 
 I done flipped the trunk on her 
 They screamin', ""Nicki leave me alone!"" 
 I am, I'm still the one to beat 
 Ain't in a rush from these streets 
 I am the streets 
 I am gettin' it in until the end 
 I gotta go, go, go, go hard! 
 Carter called, lemme get the car key 
 You don't want it with the Harajuku Barbie 
 Keep a marquis, everything sparkly (man down!) 
 Hit 'em on a walkie-talkie 
 Hit em, hit 'em knock-knock, tell 'em let me in 
 My name ring bells bitch buzz me in 
 And I only stop for pedestrians 
 Or a real real bad lesbian 
 Hit 'em with the Mac, hit 'em with the Tec 9 
 Hit 'em with the Ruger by the intersex line 
 Hit 'em with a tommy so my niggas call me Kimmy and I always the jammy in the Trunka of the lamby 
 Put my whole burrough on my back and I'm gooda 
 I don't wanna hear what you would, what you coulda 
 I represent all the girls that stood up 
 Used to drink water with a little bit of sugar 
 Now I'm in the gym with my squats and my sit-ups 
 Doin' the scissor-leg on the mat with my foot up 
 Young black pin-up, all of my bitches did up 
 Now I'm tellin' LA Reid to step his bid up 
 And I'm tellin' President Carter he picked a winner 
 Bitches like Nelly and Kelly got a dilemma 
 These birds all fly south in the winter 
 Fuck I look like chompin' on a chicken dinner? 
 You can hate me, but why knock my hustle? 
 I'ma be a queen no matter how they shuffle 
 Skirts with the ruffle, Louis on the duffle 
 I'm a bad bitch no muzzle (no muzzle) 
 Bitches is softer than Al Dente, cut from a different kenta 
 Tell 'em I'm the ninja, Weezy is my sensei 
 So I call him splinter, faster than a sprinter 
 Gimme my chopsticks, I'll have the rap bitches for dinner 
 This is for my gentlemen in button-ups and khakis 
 This is for my nigga 7-up in Castaki 
 This is for my niggas whellying them Kawasakis 
 Shout out to the back-east, South Ishakis (?) 
 This is to my fans, unless I'm feeling kinda cocky 
 Winter Wonderland is on my hand, it's kinda rocky 
 I am Nicki, Minaj or Lewinsky 
 Pumps on the clutch, right hand on the six-speed 
 Write my own raps I gotta go, I gotta get me (gotta get me) 
 If you could you would get rid of me 
 Fuck you gone do when a bitch try to go hard? 
 Bet I won't let you get to me (to me) 
 You should already figure I'm a go hard 
 If you was as real as me, you would never 
 Let another girl sit in yo throne

 Com-pe-tition. I am gettin' it in until the end 
 I gotta go, go, go, go hard! 
 Lil Wayne 
 : 
 From slap-and-cry you start to die, so I must go harder

 Better yet, like Bubba, no shrimp. but he don't say shit 
 When the gun on his lip, and I don't say shit put the gun 
 On my hip. so I don't say shit but the gun on my hip 
 If you don't wanna drown don't come on my ship 
 Check out how them bitches just run on my dick 
 And me, I'm that just a summa bitch 
 I still got that bitch cum on my lips 
 It yee ain't got money, don't come on my strip 
 And if ya got money, don't cover my strip 
 I wear that metal, no Olympic, but I can still 
 Make you tumble and flip 
 You fuckin' with me if you fuckin' with Nick 
 It ain't fuckin' with me it ain't fuckin' with Nick 
 Your girlfriend, her decision is split 
 'Cause she wanna fuck me and she wanna fuck Nick 
 They wonder if he be fuckin' Nick, as long as she be fuckin' rich 
 That's why I keep my Le Bitch (?) cause, I swear y'all's a fuckin' trip 
 Young Money Dungeon, bitch. my swagger just punch a bitch 
 And I shoot like I'm from over-seas, so call my gun, ""Gunovich""

 Maybe I'm settlin' 
 Can't let the devil in, I'm a comic book heroin 
 But when the wind blows, I'm so Marilyn 
 Write down, take a pictures, bitches e-mail that 
 I came to save a thing called female rap 
 But I hope my ninja powers 
 Don't fuck around and offend you cowards 
 You mad at me 'cause you think I got it easy 
 If we was in the second grade then you would tease me 
 Ya see, you still a lil snotty nose hood rat 
 I love Nicki scribbled all over you book bag 
 I love you too, I just wish your mother would've hugged you too 
 You know Nicki love the kids

 I am not Jasmine, I'm Aladdin 
 So far ahead, these bums is laggin' 
 See me in that new thing, bums is gaggin' 
 I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon 
 Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon 
 I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon 
 Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin' 
 So fuck I look like gettin' back to a has-been? 
 Yeah, I said it, has-been 
 Hang it up, flatscreen 
 (Haha) Plasma 
 Hey Nicki, hey Nicki, asthma 
 I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine 
 I got bars, Xenocin 
 I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt 
 And I'll kick that hoe, punt 
 Forced trauma, blunt 
 You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front 
 You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it 
 Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fuckin' with 
 You li'l brag a lot, I beat you with a pad-a-lock 
 I am a movie, camera block 
 You outta work, I know it's tough 
 But enough is enough 
 I feel Pretty (3x) 
 And witty 
 And Gay 
 And I pity Any girl who isent me tonight 
 (Eminem) 
 I ain't into S&M, but my whip's off the chain 
 A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame 
 Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain 
 An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame 
 You don't like it then peel off, bitch 
 Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off, and I still wouldn't fuck you, slut 
 So wipe the smile on your grill off, I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off 
 Get the wheels turnin', spin, and wheel off 
 Snap the axel in half, bust the tie-rod 
 Quit hollerin' ""Why, God?"" He ain't got shit to do with it 
 Bygones'll never be bygones, so won't be finished swallowin' my wad 
 I ain't finished blowin' it, nice bra 
 Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch 
 Life's hard, I swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad 
 With fake tits and a bad dye job 
 Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad 
 So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod 
 And caught her stealin' my music, so I tied her arms and legs to the bed 
 Set up the camera and pissed twice on her 
 Look, two pees and a tripod! 
 The moral to the story is, life's treatin' you like dry sod? 
 Kick it back in its face, my God 
 It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd 
 But don't ask why, bitch (Ask why not) 
 I feel uglyx3 
 Slut don't touch me or hug me 
 I'm mad And I pity Any girl who gets with me tonight 
 (Nicki Minaj) 
 You wanna sleep on me? Overnight? 
 I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite 
 And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike 
 Now all my ***** gettin' bucked, overbite 
 I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi's 
 Raggedy-ass, holes in your knee-highs 
 I call the play, now do you see why? 
 These bitches callin' me Manning, Eli 
 I-I-I-I hear them mumblin', I hear the cacklin' 
 I got 'em scared, shook, panickin' 
 Overseas, church, Vatican 
 You at a stand, still, mannequin 
 (Eminem) 
 All you li'l faggots can suck it 
 No home, but I'ma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets 
 And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend 
 Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep actin' as if 
 You have the same passion that I have 
 Yeah, right, still hungry, my ass 
 You assdicks had gastric bypass 
 Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass 
 And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids (Eyelash!) 
 Go take a flyin' leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony 
 'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass 
 You know what time it is, so why ask? 
 When Shady and Nicki's worlds class 
 It's (high class) meets (white trash) 
 I feel Pretty (3x) 
 And witty 
 And Gay 
 And I pity Any girl who isent me tonight"

23,Nicki Minaj,pop,Barbie World (Intro),"I wanna get to know you 
 I really wanna fuck you, baby 
 One dose of my lovin' 
 I'm simply going to drive you crazy 
 I wanna be your lover 
 I wanna get to know you, baby 
 One dose of my lovin' 
 I'm really gonna drive you crazy 
 (Young Buc) 
 I'm lovin' how you look in my eyes 
 Swingin' them hips when you pass 
 I'm visualizing my name tatooed on that ass baby 
 Jump on this Harley 
 Lets go smoke some of that Bob Marley 
 Sip some Bacardi 
 Then go pull up at the afterparty 
 I think we make a perfect couple 
 But you think I'm trouble 
 Maybe that's the reason you gave me the wrong number 
 She got me feeling like ""maybe she the wrong woman"" 
 Think I'm'a be chasin' the chicken head you own somethin' 
 Your toes painted hair fixed all the time 
 And your Gucci boots the same color as mine 
 If you read between the lines you can see that I want you 
 I betcha I have you doin' what you said that you won't do 
 Making decisions shorty good things don't last long 
 Your girlfriend keep showin' me that thong 
 Before I head home 
 I'm'a stop at your house and blow the horn 
 If you come outside you know it's on (holla at your boy) 
 (Lloyd Banks) 
 Bitches be frustrated with the baller 
 Wonder why I don't call her 
 Maybe because I'm busy and she needs someone to spoil her 
 It gets annoying from time to time I gotta ignore her 
 In order to let her know we'll be friends and nothing more 
 She loves it when I'm in town 
 Hate it when I'm not around 
 I get her and wear down 
 Next door neighbors hear the sound 
 Pictures hittin' the ground 
 Just enough to hold us down 
 I'm stickin' 'n' moving cruising after the third round 
 Just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy 
 I can make a 40 year old feel like a young lady 
 I admit I fell in love with her frame 
 And to make her feel special I let her call me by my government name 
 Her panties wet over fame 
 Fall in love with my chain 
 I wonder if I wasn't an entertainer would she remain 
 Surrounding me hounding me trying to be my only 
 I'm not your boyfriend I'm your homie. 
 (50 Cent) 
 (Yeah) What would fuck me up more 
 Watching her lick her lips 
 Or watching her walk she hypnotize me with her hips (yeah) man 
 I sweet talking her if she like 
 Cause all she really want is a nigga to treat her right right 
 Look I'm legit now used to break laws 
 Now you can reap the benefit of world tours 
 Big house big Benz girl it yours 
 Mink coats Italian shoes stones with no flaws 
 You ain't go to look like a model for me to adore you 
 All you gotta do is love me and be loyal 
 Don't Indulge in my past fuck what happened before you 
 Cause their be some homies gonna hate you that never saw you 
 Come here let my touch on you I let you touch on me 
 Put my tongue on you you put your tongue on me 
 Let me ride on you and you can ride on 
 We can do it all the night 
 We can have a balla tonight 
 I wanna get to know you 
 I wanna get to know you, baby 
 One dose of my lovin' 
 I'm simply gonna drive you, crazy 
 I wanna be your lover 
 I wanna get to know you, lady 
 One dose of my lovin' 
 I'm really gonna drive you, crazy 
 (x2) 
 I wanna be your lover 
 I really understand you, baby 
 I want to be your lover 
 I really understand you, baby, baby, baby, baby."

 Might breeze through The Ave, might stop at the gym, 
 And he keep a du-rag, keep the wave on swim; 
 Wa-wa-waves on swim, so they hate on him... 
 Anyway, I think I met him sometime before, 
 In a different life, or where I record... 
 I mean... he was Adam, I think I was Eve, 
 But my vision ends with the apple on the tree... 
 S-S-S on my chest, 'cause I'm ready to save him, 
 Ready to get buck on anybody that plays him... 
 And I think I love him, I love him just like I raised him; 
 When he call me ""Mama"", ""Lil' Mama"", I call him ""Baby""...

 Just left Money Gram in the Lemon Lam... 
 Hot damn, make me scream like Summer Jam; 
 I mean, that nigga must be from the motherland... 
 Anyway, I think I met him in the sky; 
 When I was a geisha, he was a samurai... 
 Somehow I understood him when he spoke Thai; 
 Never spoke lies and he never broke fly... 
 S-S-S on my chest, let me get my cape on; 
 He's so thugged out, Ghostface and 
 Raekwon 
 ... 
 Konvict! Just like 
 Akon

 Now the whole album crack, you ain't gotta skip a track 
 I ain't gotta get a plaque, I ain't gotta get awards 
 I just walk up out the door, all the girls will applaud 
 All the girls will come in, as long as they understand 
 That I'm fightin' for the girls that never thought they could win 
 'Cause before they could begin you told 'em it was the end 
 But I am here to reverse the curse that they live in 
 Got two bones to pick, I'ma only choose one 
 You might get addressed on the second album 
 Which means you can breathe till I motherfuckin' say so

 Twisted ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain 
 An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame 
 You don't like it then peel off, bitch 
 Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off, and I still wouldn't fuck you, slut 
 So wipe the smile on your grill off, I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off 
 Get the wheels turnin', spin, and wheel off 
 Snap the axel in half, bust the tie-rod 
 Quit hollerin' ""Why, God?"", He ain't got shit to do with it 
 Bygones'll never be bygones, so won't be finished swallowin' my wad 
 I ain't finished blowin' it, nice bra 
 Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch 
 Life's hard, I swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad 
 With fake tits and a bad dye job 
 Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad 
 So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod 
 And caught her stealin' my music, so I tied her arms and legs to the bed 
 Set up the camera and pissed twice on her 
 Look, two pees and a tripod 
 The moral to the story is, life's treatin' you like dry sod? 
 Kick it back in its face, my God 
 It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd 
 But don't ask why, bitch (Ask why not)

 Me against enemies, me against friends 
 Somehow they both seem to become one 
 A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood

 I am not a girl that can ever be defined 
 I am not fly, I am levitation

 So we become alive in a time of fear

 I swear sometimes I feel like it nurtures me 
 But to keep it all real is kinda hurtin' me 
 I could say I'm done with it, but it lurks in me 
 So Imma just tell myself that it works for me 
 Take a real long drive in the Mer-ce-des 
 And I might pop a couple of them per-co-cets 
 Yeah that'll make me transform to Hercules 
 Here I am, here I am, so tell me, 'cause I am 
 Here I am, here I am, so tell me, 'cause I am 
 Here I am, here I am, so tell me, 'cause I am 
 I swear to God, man, everything in life is old 
 And the only thing that change is the price of gold 
 Even in the afterlife Imma fight your soul 
 'Cause the second time around I'll be twice as grown 
 So do you take me to be who I am? 
 To have and to hold till death do us part 
 'Cause if not it's just best we both part 
 'Cause how am I supposed to finish what you start? 
 You got me thinkin' twice to just breathe 
 Then you say I won't survive if I leave 
 But I got a couple of tricks up my sleeve 
 I no longer need your attention, at ease 
 It's a joke, it's a game, 
 Why am I still keeping score? 
 I'm in pain, I'm ashamed 
 I'm a woman, hear me roar

57,Nicki Minaj,pop,Dear Old Nicki,"Maybe you died 'cause everybody asked me, ""Where you at?"" 
 I tried to channel you in hopes that I could stare you back 
 But it's like every intersection we just missed each other 
 You got your fans waiting, tell me you ain't six feet under 
 And tell that you coming back and you just took a break 
 Maybe I blamed you for everything - that was my mistake 
 In hindsight, I loved your rawness and I loved your edge 
 'Cause it was you who talked me down from jumping off the ledge 
 Your earrings bamboo 
 Your long nails, too 
 Your BMW 
 Every time you came through 
 You was the brave heart 
 You stole Wayne heart 
 You never switched it up 
 You played the same part 
 But I needed to grow 
 And I needed to know 
 Were there some things inside of me that I needed to show? 
 So I just deaded you 
 Left you in all black 
 But dear, old Nicki 
 Please call back 
 You told me you'd come when I needed you 
 And you said it so sweetly I believed you 
 But I'm standing here calling 
 I can't see you 
 But I am holding you, holding you, holding you to that 
 Yo, did I chase the glitz and glamour? 
 Money, fame and power? 
 'Cause if so that will forever go down my lamest hour 
 I should've kept you with me, gettin' at them nameless cowards 
 There was no match for you 
 Couldn't defeat your prowess 
 I had to make them changes - I hope you understood 
 You see for every bad, I did a ton of good 
 But you was underground and I was mainstream 
 I live the life now, that we would daydream 
 My only wish is you come enjoy it with me 
 Get on them conference calls 
 Go meet them lawyers with me 
 The money came, yeah 
 Tripled and quadrupled it 
 But I still miss us when we was just on some stupid shit 
 And it still fucked the media 
 They ridiculed you 
 Never believed in ya 
 They just deaded you 
 Left you in all black 
 But dear, old Nicki 
 Please call back 
 You told me you'd come when I needed you 
 And you said it so sweetly I believed you 
 But I'm standing here calling 
 I can't see you 
 But I am holding you, holding you, holding you to that

 Until I touch down in the in-zone, and then they come out like roaches 
 P-p-pecking away like vultures, but little did they know, distribute the pay roll 
 Pick up the outfit, pick out the single, sadly I'm so business-savvy 
 Similar protocol but the templates vary, never been like me, never been like this 
 My flow's a crisis, they scream in high pitch, uh guncock, pause and I'm well aware of the gun laws 
 Tell 'em that I'm coming for the top, Forbes, headed to the top dot org

 Thinkin' we was on, you telling me we off 
 Your whole vibe changed when you got the phone call 
 That's the affect they call a snow ball,

 Saying, ""Please come back, I have given my all.""

 Could you catch me, could you catch me, 
 Could you catch me? 
 I am waiting on you to catch me 
 You want it, oh, so bad to prove points 
 But your game always makes me lose points 
 And your game always makes me concur 
 That maybe I should have never taken you from her 
 But with all of the aforementioned 
 I am still trapped in your dimension 
 So I will be on the mountain waiting 
 'Cause I am in need of more attention 
 Could've called back, just to say some 
 I'ma fall back, in the bass drum 
 Please come to, destination 
 I'm not doing well, exclamation 
 You succeeded at your attempts to make me 
 Need you desperately, to vindicate me

 Your silhouette in the doorway 
 But before you walk away 
 Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes 
 So that I always will remember 
 Frozen in time, always be mine 
 Baby boy you'll be young forever 
 I'll be over here, you'll be over there 
 I'ma shed a tear but I really don't care 
 Frozen in time, always be mine 
 Baby boy you'll be young forever 
 I used to think that we'd reunite 
 I'd be your wife, in the real life 
 I thought that you'd come back for me 
 And you would take me away 
 I never knew only as a teen 
 You'd reappear, only in my dream 
 Your silhouette in the doorway 
 But before you walk away 
 Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes 
 So that I always will remember 
 Frozen in time, always be mine 
 Baby boy you'll be young forever 
 I'll be over here, you'll be over there 
 I'ma shed a tear but I really don't care 
 Frozen in time, always be mine 
 Baby boy you'll be young forever 
 This is my last cry 
 Is this the only way? 
 This is my own prison 
 I'm frozen in time, in time, in time 
 Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes 
 So that I always will remember 
 Frozen in time, always be mine 
 Baby boy you'll be young forever 
 I'll be over here, you'll be over there 
 Wanna shed a tear but I really don't care 
 Frozen in time, always be mine 
 Baby boy you'll be young forever 
 You'll always be mine, frozen in time 
 Young forever (young forever)"

 You let me beg, for you to stay 
 This is a sickening joke that you play with my emotions 
 And so I pray you burn in hell and you never find the ocean... 
 I hope your fire, fire burns baby 
 I hope your fire, fire burns baby 
 I hope you lay down in your sleep and you choke on every lie you told 
 And when you're reaching out for me you'll see you reap everything you sow 
 You piece of shit, you broke me down 
 Thought you said you, would hold me down 
 But I can see it in your eyes that your blinded by the flashing lights 
 And you's a stupid muthafucker for letting this thing pass you by 
 I hope your fire, fire burns baby

 And when you're reaching out for me you'll see you reap everything you sow"

88,Nicki Minaj,pop,Press Conference,"(Charlamagne) 
 Let's talk about New York City. 
 I actually get in arguments because people say Nicki doesn't rep New York. 
 I say ""What do you mean? She shouts it out all of the time."" 
 (Nicki Minaj) 
 Y'all don't want me to rep y'all. 
 Y'all don't hear when I rep y'all 'cause y'all be dick-riding everybody else. 
 Do you feel you get the proper love from New York? 
 Hell fucking no. 
 I never understood that because you ran the same circuits of all these other rappers. 
 You came up on mixtapes like everyone else... 
 I was selling my mixtape out of my muthafucking BMW out on Jamaica muthafuckin' Avenue to Amadue and Hussaine and all them. 
 Fuck you niggas! 
 You niggas don't know the half of what I've been through! 
 (Charlemagne) 
 What do you say to people that say you're trying to be something that you're not like Lady Gaga or Madonna and you're doing things for shock value? 
 Well, I don't know. 
 In a minute, if I fucking sit down and piss, they're going to tell me I can't do that 'cause another bitch did it. 
 (SB) 
 Stupid ass bitches! 
 People compare her to everybody. 
 Nicki gets it so hard! 
 (Charlamagne) 
 I think when they don't understand something they have to compare it to something to make themselves feel comfortable. 
 (Nicki Minaj) 
 Absolutely, I always say that. 
 For their minds to interpret it, they have to draw a comparison and I always say, even though it's very common, it's just a more simple-minded approach as opposed to looking at every situation as if it's the first time. 
 It is what it is but even she gets compared to Madonna and it's a never-ending cycle but I rather you compare me to someone that is winning and that's won then compare me to... 
 (Charlamagne) 
 Someone that is washed. 
 (Nicki Minaj) 
 It's easy for a loser to be jealous of a winner. 
 (Charlemagne) 
 Do you ever look back at some of your costumes and your wigs and say, ""I did look like a damn fool""? 
 (Nicki Minaj) 
 Yes, I do! 
 You know what I like about superstars? 
 I like my superstars to be out there. 
 Be like Prince with your ass out. 
 I may see it and say, ""Damn, she looks like a fool,"" but you're a superstar. 
 That's how I want to see my superstars. 
 I don't want to see my superstars regular. 
 I keep saying this: I went to school for theater. 
 I took four years of my life and devoted it to theater. 
 I did that because my passion was acting. 
 When I started rapping, I felt like I couldn't really be myself. 
 When I started winning, I started feeling that I can be myself. 
 I can do my accents, I can do my voices, I can do my faces, I can do costumes. 
 I can now bring me to who, you know, people see as Nicki Minaj. 
 I can now really bring me into it. 
 And I think that's where the confusion lies is that people thought that when I first came out, that that was me in my entirety. 
 But that wasn't. That was a small facet of who I was. 
 But, who you see now is a more multi-faceted mixture of all the different personalities that I have in me. 
 I mean... and I think that if I was to not show that, then I wouldn't be doing justice to all the people who feel like I do. 
 'Cause for every person who doesn't understand it is, there is a person who feels like me, who feels like... sometimes I just break out in an English accent, you know, like, what's wrong with that? 
 (Charlemagne) 
 Do you think that pop Nicki and mixtape Nicki can exist in the same space? 
 (Nicki Minaj) 
 They already are and they are both winning. 
 If it's one thing that I would love for little girls to embrace from Nicki Minaj is the fact that she is versatile. 
 She knows how to kick it in the streets and she knows how to kick it in the corporate setting. 
 Right, because you can't do too much of either, you really can't. 
 It's unfortunate that at times hip hop culture will tell you to lean only to one side, when that is detrimental to your future. 
 It's detrimental for your growth. 
 It's detrimental to your longevity. 
 At a certain point as a woman; I'm not talking about as a man because we've seen 
 The Blueprint 
 with Jay. 
 We've seen that you could come in the game and do 10, 12, 15 - still win and still be the king of hip hop. 
 We have not seen that with a woman so show me the blueprint. 
 That's all I want you to do - show me the blueprint. 
 I think you are creating it, because Queen Latifah doesn't exist in that space anymore. 
 She went on to become an actress 
 Queen Latifah is someone who I tip my hat to because Queen Latifah looked at it and said, ""Okay, wait, hmm, I mean I wanna be 40 years old rapping. I - the hip hop fans may not want to hear me when I'm 40 years old rapping. 
 So I'm going to move in a way so that every aspect of who I am can be seen."" 
 Queen Latifah does musicals, movies, voice-overs for cartoons - is she a sellout or is she winning? 
 So these other bitches that only did rap and now they're washed, and they're living in, you know, low income housing - is that winning? 
 Just so that a nigga in the street can give me a fucking dap? 
 The same niggas that didn't buy my album any fucking way, that downloaded the shit? 
 Get the fuck out of here. 
 (Charlemagne) 
 Any regrets? 
 (Nicki Minaj) 
 I think my only regret would be not enjoying every single moment as I should have. 
 On what she would like to do outside of rap, her bigger purpose. 
 I have to pray on that. 
 I think that my purpose will eventually be related to some sort of movement for my younger fans really... 
 I really am interested in learning how to build the education system to a point where we have more of a success rate in terms of black children that go from high school to college. 
 I feel like college was not something that was engraved in my brain. 
 I don't feel like that ever happened. 
 Most of my closest girlfriends, it was just like once they got out of high school they figured, ""Oh well, we're out of high school,"" or ""I got my GED, I'm good,"" and I don't want my fans to think like that. 
 One day, you're going to look back and think ""Wait a minute, did I really lose my life clubbing and miss out on a moment where I could've been building myself as a woman and having something to offer my children?"" 
 We got so many girls right now having children and don't even know the first thing to say to a child. 
 You're having a child because I want to keep this dude or it just happened. 
 I want to get us to the place where it doesn't just happen and that we're smarter than that. 
 We're the ones in control again. 
 Why are we never in control? 
 Why are we stuck with a baby? 
 Why are we always stuck on the welfare line? 
 Why are we always stuck having to beg, borrow, and steal to provide for our children? 
 Why do we think it's something wrong for waiting to have a baby? 
 Waiting until you're 35 or 36 to have children; technology has changed - you can wait. 
 Have something to offer them. 
 That's something that's dear to my heart. 
 Doing something that make children feel like I don't have to rush to grow up. 
 I can enjoy my childhood. 
 (Charlemagne) 
 How did you escape being more than just an ass? 
 We said that the other day, before I was just a rapping butt. 
 (SB) 
 A butt with lyrics. 
 (Charlemagne) 
 How did you get out of that? 
 (Nicki Minaj) 
 Because I created a brand. 
 People take for granted how hard it is so shout out to every woman and man that's won. 
 It's very hard, mentally, this shit is draining. 
 For you to be able to get up there and do music that people love, and do interviews with a smile on your face and act like this shit ain't getting to you, it's draining. 
 It's crazy. 
 That's why so many artists go on drugs or become alcoholics. 
 When I was coming up, I never understood it. 
 I use to be like, ""What? They are so ungrateful. Why are they on drugs? Why don't they fucking appreciate their success? I would kill to be where they are,"" until you get here and you are like, ""Lord, is this the price I have to pay if I really want this?"" 
 He's like, ""Yup, now let's see who really want it."" 
 I think I became more than that, because people cannot deny... 
 (Charlamagne) 
 You the shit. 
 Say it! 
 You don't have to be humble. 
 Be like Ray J. 
 ""I'm tired of being humble."" 
 (Nicki Minaj) 
 I'm not a cocky person by nature."

 Screaming ""Hell yeah, hell yeah!"" 
 Yeah, yea, I ain't see you on the Forbes yet 
 Swear to God I ain't see you in the stores yet 
 Donatella on the corset 
 Pretty game in the back of my Corvette 
 Got my best friends Rangers and Benzes 
 Plus all my menses Louis V lenses 
 This is how you feel when you winning 
 Man they been rocking with me since the beginning, inning 
 This is where the stress end 
 Feel ill when you never got a stress ends 
 Always in the press when paparazzi in the bushes 
 With the stretch lens, say cheese to that 
 Pull up on the double R, pop clutch on them 
 And them strippers ain't mad when I touch on them 
 Russell Simmons shoe game, put rush on them 
 Send a GT Vodka, sitting on top of 
 Mafia money eating seafood pasta 
 VMAs, that was good there 
 Front row, yea, always in a good chair 
 The bad gon boo but the good cheer 
 That's why my pocket son blimp like the Good Year 
 What we do when we go high, we doing it all night 
 Oh the girls they wanna vibe with us tonight 
 I'm in the middle of the club with my niggas and we all fucked up 
 Screaming ""Hell yeah, hell yeah!"" 
 But you boring as fuck though 
 Why these bitches in the game so cutthroat 
 Why they can't just let young Nicki live 
 Why they gotta feel the wrath to know Nicki is 
 Not playing, boss for real 
 When they go against the kid, it's gon cost for real 
 Came straight from the hood with the cross apeal 
 That's why these big names wanna toss the deal 
 Okay, I'll take it, sign on the dotted line 
 But I'm quick to the check a bitch if she outta line 
 Shout out Mike, Darnell, and Nigel 
 Why these bums so mad that the queen on Idol, huh? 
 Say cheese to that, when they see me on the screen 
 Check E! for that, bitches lying on the kid I won't leave for that 
 Intimidated by my ORA, where Rita at? 
 Send a GT Vodka in a helicopter 
 Me and my Japanese bitches in Osaka 
 BET, I was good there 
 Front row, yeah, always in a good chair 
 Why the fuck would I leave when I'm good here? 
 Lemme send a twitpic of my good hair, yea yea

92,Nicki Minaj,pop,High School,"He said he came from Jamaica. 
 He owned a couple acres. 
 A couple fake Visas 
 'Cause he never got his papers. 
 Gave up on love 
 Fucking with them heartbreakers, 
 But he was getting money 
 With the movers and the shakers. 
 He was mixed with a couple things. 
 Ball like a couple rings. 
 Bricks in the condo. 
 And grams to Sing-Sing. 
 Left arm-baby mother tatted. 
 5-year bid up north when they ratted. 
 Anyway, I felt him, helped him, 
 Put him on lock. 
 Seatbelt him. 
 Took him out to Belgium-welcome. 
 Bitches this pretty. That's seldom. 
 This box better than the box he was held in. 
 I'm Momma Dee in that order. 
 I call him ""Daddy"" like daughters. 
 He like it when I get drunk, 
 But I like it when he be sober. 
 That's top of the topper. 
 I never fuck with beginners. 
 I let him play with my pussy. 
 Then lick it off of his fingers. I'm in the zone. 
 They holler at me, but it's you, you. 
 This ain't high school. 
 Me and my crew, 
 We can slide through. 
 Give it to you whenever you want. 
 Whip it wherever you want.

 Ain't it? 
 She got a nigga at home. And one on the side. 
 Best friend is a dyke. 
 They fucked around a few times. 
 Her and her momma alike, so all they do is fight. 
 I tell her, ""Make me some money."" 
 She tells me make me a wife. 
 I tell her, ""Bitch, you crazy. 
 Fucks wrong with you?"" 
 And excuse my French, 
 But I'm a long kisser. 
 And then she tries to tells me 
 I'm the only one that's hitting. 
 And I say, ""What about them niggas?"" 
 She say, ""What about them niggas?"" 
 ""You're right. What you doing tonight? 
 Put on something tight. Don't judge me. I get life."" 
 She loves me like a brother, 
 But fucks me like a husband. 
 Pussy like an oven. 
 Too hot to put my tongue in. 
 All I had to do was rub it- 
 The genie out the bottle. 
 Pussy's so wet, 
 I'm a need goggles. 
 She tells me that it's mine. 
 I tell her, ""Stop lying."" 
 Mine and who elses?"" 
 She say, ""Worry 'bout yourself, Lil Tune."" 
 They holler at me, but it's you, you. 
 This ain't high school. 
 Me and my crew, 
 We can slide through. 
 Give it to you whenever you want. 
 Whip it wherever you want.

 Baby, it's your world! 
 Ain't it?

96,Nicki Minaj,pop,All Things Go,"Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in vent 
 I put the heat in vents, man I been competin' since 
 I look beyond what people sayin', and I see intent 
 Then I just sit back and decipher, what they really meant 
 Cherish these nights, cherish these people 
 Life is a movie, but there will never be a sequel 
 And I'm good with that, as long as I'm peaceful 
 As long as 7 years from now, I'm taking my daughter to preschool 
 Cherish these days, man do they go quick 
 Just yesterday, I swear it was o' six 
 Ten years ago, that's when you proposed 
 I look down, yes I suppose 
 All things go, all things go 
 All things go, all things go 
 I feel a minute, yeah we got it then it's gone 
 While we keep waiting for a moment till it falls 
 So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong 
 'Cause I'm a ride I'm with you still the night is young 
 We keep goin', we go, we go, we go 
 We wake back up and do it all again 
 We know, we know, say fuck the world, we ridin' till the end 
 I know it's sudden, look at what we've become 
 I just want you to know that I did it for you 
 I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence 
 His sister said, he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him 
 Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'? 
 'Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same 
 Even though they know, that I love him 
 Family ties, broken before me, niggas tryna kill him, he ain't even call me 
 And that's the reflection of me, yes I get it, I get it, it was all me 
 I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes, the last day he saw me 
 All things go, all things go 
 All things go, all things go 
 I feel a minute, yeah we got it then it's gone 
 While we keep waiting for a moment till it falls 
 So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong 
 'Cause I'm a ride I'm with you still the night is young 
 We keep goin', we go, we go, we go 
 We wake back up and do it all again 
 We know, we know, say fuck the world, we ridin' till the end 
 I know it's sudden, look at what we've become 
 I just want you to know that I did it for you 
 Let me make this clear I'm not difficult, I'm just about my business 
 I'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas 
 Rock with people for how they make me feel not what they give me 
 Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness 
 I love my mother more than life itself, and that's a fact 
 I'd give it all, if somehow, I could just rekindle that 
 She never understands, why I'm so overprotective 
 The more I work, the more I feel like, somehow they're neglected 
 I want 'Caiah to go to college, just to say ""We did it!"" 
 My child with Aaron, would've been sixteen, any minute 
 So in some ways I feel like 'Caiah, is the both of them 
 It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him 
 And I know Jelani will always love me, and I'll always love him 
 And I'm just his little sister not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him 
 Yeah we did it, let's leave this imprint 
 Just finished writing, this is the Pinkprint

 All things go, all things go"

 To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh 
 To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh 
 Even though I said don't touch me I lied, I lied 
 I can't fall for you, can't give my all to you 
 I can't let you think that Imma let the game stall for you 
 Gotta protect me you gotta sweat me 
 You said you thought you was ready and I said let's see 
 But I ain't mean that, I need some fucking proof 
 'Cause what happens if I fall in love then you cut me loose 
 You just a heart breaker won't let you break mine 
 'Cause I'll be smashing windows and cutting them break lines 
 I lied 
 'Cause who knew if I should let myself go with you 
 Who knows, who knows, so I lied 
 To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh 
 To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh 
 Even though I said fuck you, I lied, I lied 
 I thought eventually you would let me go 
 That was my insecurities and my ego 
 Missed my jump shot missed my free throw 
 Miss the way we kiss miss the d o 
 Man it was good while it lasted 
 That shit wasn't real it was magic 
 If it was a record it would have been classic 
 But fuck you though, orgasmic 
 This is what I gotta do to keep me from falling 
 Stalling the truth, who knew what you'd 
 Do If I let you in 
 My mama ain't raised no fool 
 I am not your usual typical type 
 Who would protect me if I never hide? 
 Falling so fast I am afraid of you 
 So I lied, I lied, I lied

 To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh 
 I lied, ooh baby, ooh 
 'Cause what if I let myself go with you"

 You was just tellin' your man's, that you hate the clubs

 We're back to playing

 Don't wanna let the tears begin 
 We're back to playing

 Welcome to the crying game where you lose your soul 
 Where it ain't no easy cash, you got to use the toll 
 Ain't no cruise control, you 'bout to lose control 
 Ain't no smilin' faces here, we slammin' doors and dishes 
 Sayin' we don't miss each other, but it's all fictitious 
 Sayin' that we had enough, but enough of what? 
 Another slap to the face, another uppercut 
 I'm just abusive by nature, not 'cause I hate ya 
 Not 'cause I wanna, guess I wanna imitate ya 
 I know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya 
 But is you stayin' or goin'? 
 I couldn't breathe and you ain't even know it 
 How come you never show it? 
 All this love you speak of 
 All I want is to love and to be loved 
 (To love and to be loved) 
 I'm losin' a thing I thought I'd win 
 And I'm coming undone 
 'Cause the tears don't end 
 Where did you go? 
 Couldn't see 
 I was too busy 
 Couldn't've just said no 
 Where would you go? 
 I think I know 
 Ooh, ooh, we're back to playing, 
 We're back to playing. 
 Ooh, ooh, we're back to playing,

 Do you ever think of me, when you lie? 
 Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies 
 And I knew better, than to look in your eyes 
 They only pretend, you will be mine 
 And you know how you made me, believe 
 You had me caught in every web, that you weaved 
 But do you ever think of me, when you lie? 
 Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies 
 Nicki Minaj 
 You could never make eye contact 
 Everything you got was based off of my contacts 
 You a fraud, but I'mma remain icon-stat 
 Balenciaga's on my boots with the python strap 
 You was caught up in the rush, and you was caught up in the thrill of it 
 You was with me way before, I hit a quarter mil' in it 
 Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it 
 I was killin' it, man you got me poppin' pills in it 
 I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin' 
 'Cause I was doing it for us, I told 'em fuck the public 
 Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating 
 Overdosin', no more postin', no more toastin' over oceans 
 They say you don't know what you got till it's gone 
 They say that your darkest hour comes before your dawn 
 But there was something I should've asked all along 
 I'mma ask on the song

 Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies 
 Nicki Minaj 
 I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes 
 You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies 
 I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace 
 But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate 
 I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend 
 What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend 
 When the tears roll down it's like you ain't even notice em 
 If you had a heart, I was hoping you would've showed it some 
 What the fuck you really telling me, what you telling me 
 I could tell you lying, get the fuck out don't yell at me 
 I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't want to catch a felony 
 This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy 
 They say you don't know what you got till it's gone 
 They said that your darkest hour came before your dawn 
 But there was something that I should've asked all along 
 I'mma ask on the song 
 Skylar Grey 
 So does she know I've been in that bed before 
 A thousand count, and not a single threaded truth 
 If I was just another girl 
 Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you 
 There's one thing I need to know 
 So call me, when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself

 This is the autobiography of Nicki Maraj 
 May the Lord protect me as the world gets hectic 
 My voice projected, my life reflected 
 May the Lord protect me as the world gets hectic 
 My voice projected, my life reflected 
 Daddy was a crack fiend 
 Two in the morning had us runnin' down the block like a track team 
 When he burned the house down and my mother was in it, 
 How could I forget it, the pain was infinite 
 She's my queen and I ain't even British 
 She's the only reason that I went to school and I finished 
 She told me that I had talent, 
 Got on her knees and prayed for me when I started being violent 
 She saw something in me that, till this day I don't know if I could be that 
 But I'ma die trying, and when I'm done 
 Crying, grab the iron, black out like I'm retiring 
 Nightmares of you killing my mother, 
 The reason that I sleep with my head under the covers 
 And they shoulda thrown the book at you, 
 'Cause I hate you so much that it burn when I look at you 
 May the Lord protect me as the world gets hectic 
 My voice projected, my life reflected 
 May the Lord protect me as the world gets hectic 
 My voice projected, my life reflected 
 Damn I wanna run to you 
 Hold you and kiss you and tell you how I miss you 
 Thought I would have a son for you 
 But now it's official, it's over and I can't let you go 
 But I gotta let you know, all the shit I did make me feel 
 Like I'm dying real slow 
 'Cause no one understands me, 
 They don't know what to do, when I'm hurt, when I'm angry 
 You was my friend, and my man and my daddy 
 You was there when that bitch tried to stab me 
 Anything I ever needed, knew you had me 
 'Cause of you, all them chicks couldn't stand me 
 So why hurt you? That's the question 
 It took this long for me to learn my lesson 
 'Cause now all I want is peace, forget drama 
 I finally understand the true meaning of Karma 
 May the Lord protect me as the world gets hectic 
 My voice projected, my life reflected 
 May the Lord protect me as the world gets hectic 
 My voice projected, my life reflected 
 Please baby forgive me 
 Mommy was young, Mommy was too busy 
 Tryna have fun, but now I pat myself on the back, for sending you back 
 'Cause God knows I was better than that 
 To conceive you then leave you, 
 The concept alone seems evil, I'm trapped in my conscious 
 I adhere to the nonsense, 
 Listening to people who told me I wasn't ready for you 
 But how the fuck would they know what I was ready to do? 
 And of course it wasn't your fault 
 I could feel you in the air, I hear you 
 Saying 'Mommy don't cry can't you see I'm right here?' 
 I gotta let you know what you mean to me 
 When I'm sleepin', I could see you in my dreams with me 
 Wish I could touch your little face and hold your little hand 
 If it's part of God's plan maybe we can meet again 
 My voice projected, my life reflected 
 May the Lord protect me as the world gets hectic

 Jump on this Harley 
 Lets go smoke some of that Bob Marley 
 Sip some Bacardi 
 Then go pull up at the afterparty 
 I think we make a perfect couple 
 But you think I'm trouble 
 Maybe that's the reason you gave me the wrong number 
 She got me feeling like ""maybe she the wrong woman"" 
 Think I'm'a be chasin' the chicken head you own somethin' 
 Your toes painted hair fixed all the time 
 And your Gucci boots the same color as mine 
 If you read between the lines you can see that I want you 
 I betcha I have you doin' what you said that you won't do 
 Making decisions shorty good things don't last long 
 Your girlfriend keep showin' me that thong 
 Before I head home 
 I'm'a stop at your house and blow the horn 
 If you come outside you know it's on (holla at your boy)

 Bitches be frustrated with the baller 
 Wonder why I don't call her 
 Maybe because I'm busy and she needs someone to spoil her 
 It gets annoying from time to time I gotta ignore her 
 In order to let her know we'll be friends and nothing more 
 She loves it when I'm in town 
 Hate it when I'm not around 
 I get her and wear down 
 Next door neighbors hear the sound 
 Pictures hittin' the ground 
 Just enough to hold us down 
 I'm stickin' 'n' moving cruising after the third round 
 Just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy 
 I can make a 40 year old feel like a young lady 
 I admit I fell in love with her frame 
 And to make her feel special I let her call me by my government name 
 Her panties wet over fame 
 Fall in love with my chain 
 I wonder if I wasn't an entertainer would she remain 
 Surrounding me hounding me trying to be my only 
 I'm not your boyfriend I'm your homie. 
 (50 Cent) 
 (Yeah) What would fuck me up more 
 Watching her lick her lips 
 Or watching her walk she hypnotize me with her hips (yeah) man 
 I sweet talking her if she like 
 Cause all she really want is a nigga to treat her right right 
 Look I'm legit now used to break laws 
 Now you can reap the benefit of world tours 
 Big house big Benz girl it yours 
 Mink coats Italian shoes stones with no flaws 
 You ain't go to look like a model for me to adore you 
 All you gotta do is love me and be loyal 
 Don't Indulge in my past fuck what happened before you 
 Cause their be some homies gonna hate you that never saw you 
 Come here let my touch on you I let you touch on me 
 Put my tongue on you you put your tongue on me

 Cooking up tryna eat niggas, steak and ribs

 Nowadays blow the candles out, don't even make a wish 
 Having good times, making good money 
 Lot of bad bitches, but they good to me 
 I make them do the splits for a rap 
 Wish you niggas good luck, tryna get where I'm at

 Stay putting on for the town, may I? 
 What you call a crib in the sky? Play-high 
 Over a mil in three weeks, yeah I did it like a champ 
 Momma taught me pride, yeah she did it with the stamps 
 Wait a minute, everybody pause for the photo 
 Somebody tell these local hating niggas, I'm global 
 Tell me what I gotta do to get this champagne going 
 What I gotta do to get this coconut flowing? 
 Don't let me hear Shawn Carter, I'm the ballest of the ace 
 Let me hit up Sean Combs, money cases in my place, let's celebrate 
 It's a celebration 
 Put it up for the ghetto

 They know who we are by now 
 They know who we are 
 Champion, a champion 
 What up Nicki? it's nasty yeah yeah yeah 
 I saw my first two million dollars, I was 23 
 I'm barely a man, yet, I had some killers under me 
 This ain't rated PG, this rated PJ 
 Cause that's where a nigga from; murder on replay 
 My 24th b-day, I'm sailing to Bermy, 
 You can see me on a yacht Blasting Pac, little not, I ain't greedy 
 I'm back to thugging, bitches, back to making them kiss other bitches 
 My man sister like me, I don't fuck my brother sister 
 I just aspire your desire to be different 
 My ten year old plan is just one year to finish 
 My list looks like this, first thing that you'll discover 
 The difference in pussy: white, black, Latin and other 
 Here's a man who clearly isn't basic 
 Waiting list, just to hear me or witness the greatness 
 Loud laughter while writin' my next chapter 
 Fast cash life, happily ever after

 So miserable I'ma storm through the puddle 
 Cupid's got a weapon gotta part with the devil 
 Tell him that I'm done tell him that I'm not here 
 Hit him with the lamp I'ma hit him with a chair 
 Throw the 2-sign I'm dome wit sons 
 Slo-mo as the pellets throw right from the gun

 'Cause cupid's got a gun 
 And he shot me with it

 Now who said he's a lover 
 Really he's a murderer 
 I should have known 
 By the way he took my breath away 
 And the way he held me 
 Often hurt me 
 He told me love was pain 
 I saw the winding road 
 Spinning out of control 
 Surrendered to his wrong direction 
 Now I don't know where to go 
 'Cause cupid's got a gun 
 Cupid's got a gun 
 Now who said he's a lover

 And when I'm Philly I gotta fuck Gilly 
 Snatch his big mac and slap a bitch silly

 Put it in half way Red Cafe 
 Put the pussy on his freckles 
 Haha that tickles 
 Uncle Murda could bring the handcuffs 
 Why is that, I gotta watch out gotta get a rough neck 
 As for Gravy he might could beat 
 You know them fat niggas love to eat 
 And when I want a Nicki Minaj who could it be 
 It's them Yung Gunaz Chris and Lil Neefe 
 Nicki what about Fendi he made you pop 
 Tell him to kick rocks or give me some top 
 I'm on my way to jers to break Ransom off 
 Quench his thirst when my pants come off 
 Murda Mook and Miles gone have to battle 
 Scoop whoever win and tell him to scadattle 
 Run up on Mims he could give me backshots 
 This is why, this is why, this why I'm hot, nigga 
 Dreams of fuckin' a rap rap dude

171,Nicki Minaj,pop,Encore '07,"Thank you 
 Thank you for comin' out tonight 
 Ladies and gentlemen 
 I am the president of Dirty Money Records 
 (What the hell are you waiting for?) 
 New York city 
 Who you know fresher than Nick? 
 Riddle me that 
 Mami you itty bitty can't mirror me back 
 Everybody gon' see where I'm lyrically at 
 Used to hate Nicki now dey givin' me dat 
 I live and I learn but I wait my turn 
 I'm always on the run, got weight to burn 
 Ease off the gas then I make a turn 
 Three off the pass they don't play like her 
 Why I can't just be ill? 
 Why when they see me bitches gotta to go ""Ew""? 
 Why my lil' nigga still gotta sell krills? 
 Why I'm this hot and still didn't get a deal? 
 The rain and the pain I done paid my dues 
 I'm ready for the game I done laced my shoes 
 Everything I say believe I'm gon' do 
 Came out the coop petite with tall boots 
 Can I get an encore I know you want more 
 I know you sick of all them girls, they such a bore 
 But it's my time I need you to roar 
 It's my time I need you to roar 
 (What the hell are you waiting for?) 
 After me, there shall be no more 
 It's my time I need you to roar 
 (What the hell are you waiting for?) 
 Look what you made me do, look what I made for you 
 Know when I paid my dues, that I would aim for you 
 Straight from the streets of Queens and yet it seems 
 The only thing they know is that I push a beam 
 All they see's a pretty face, how I ride the base 
 So I put my hoodie down just to hide my face 
 They don't see the tears I cry, the fears I hide 
 Tend to keep my cares inside, it's merely pride 
 Like my grandmother, I wonder if she next to pop 
 Said the next time I seen her she would be in a box 
 Damn she was right, she was dead right 
 How was I to know, that would be her last night? 
 If I could turn back the time 
 Dear God, somehow could you press rewind? 
 Won't come when I call, but he just in time 
 So I come when he call like I'm next in line 
 When you got something good why the devil gotta ruin it? 
 Guess she never know I be the best bitch doing it 
 (Linkin Park) 
 Tired of being what you want me to be 
 Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface 
 Don't know what you're expecting of me 
 Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes 
 (Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow) 
 Every step that I take is another mistake to you 
 (Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow) 
 And every second I waste is more than I can take 
 I've become so numb I can't feel you there 
 Become so tired so much more aware 
 I'm becoming this all I want to do 
 Is be more like me and be less like you 
 I've become so numb 
 (Nicki Minaj) 
 Can I get an encore 
 I know you want more 
 (I've become so numb) 
 But it's my time I need y'all to roar 
 It's my time I need y'all to roar"

 And he'd show me the city 
 From a bird's eye view 
 Said he came from Jamaica 
 He had a lil' paper 
 He owned a couple acres 
 And then I caught the vapors 
 That's how we got together 
 On the bike 
 Late night 
 Kawasaki leathers 
 He used to wine and dine me 
 Dom and sex 
 And we be arm and armor 
 Mani dress 
 See I ain't need a leprechaun 
 Or four leaf clover 
 I jus woke up one morning 
 And he copped the Rover 
 See I knew about them girls he had back then 
 But I was getting money I ain't care 'bout them 
 Because they was getting G's 
 I had N's 
 I used to split my dividends with all my friends 
 'Cause I was in the lounge 
 They was in the Greyhound 
 Like in and out of town 
 Moving coke by the pound like 
 Guess it didn't sound right 
 Cause them bitches was mad 
 Started plotting 
 Trying to get what I had 
 See my homegirl Teisha 
 Said that Keisha with the real black lips 
 Used to smoke that reefer 
 Some bitch named Dawn 
 Used to fuck LaiQwan 
 And Alicia with the chinky eyes 
 Used to be with freaky Ty 
 Lived across the street 
 From this nigga named Tiki Diamond 
 Yeah, chicken noodle bitches 
 Like a pack of Ramen 
 They had it out for me 
 Kidnapped my brother 
 At the rucker 
 'Cause he used to put it down for me

 Cause no matter where you was I held you down 
 Up north to uptown

 Strick nine one time in your Welch's grape

 Give me some f-ing room 
 Go get your mind right and take it as a lesson learned

 But I take a left and leave them hanging like a testi 
 Trash talk to 'em then I put 'em in a hefty 
 Running down the court I'm dunkin' on 'em Lisa Leslie 
 It's going down, basement, Friday the 13th guess who's playing Jason 
 Tuck yourself in you better hold on to your teddy 
 It's nightmare on Elm street and guess who's playing Freddy 
 (My chick bad) 
 Chef cooking for me, they say my shoe game crazy 
 The mental Asylum looking for me 
 You a rookie to me

 Took everything from inside of me 
 Your silhouette in the doorway 
 But before you walk away 
 Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes 
 So that I always will remember 
 Frozen in time, always be mine 
 Baby boy you'll be young forever 
 I'll be over here, you'll be over there 
 I'ma shed a tear but I really don't care 
 Frozen in time, always be mine 
 Baby boy you'll be young forever 
 I used to think that we'dExplain reunite 
 I'd be your wife in the real life 
 I thought that you'd come back for me 
 And you would take me away 
 I never knew only as a teen 
 You'd reappear only in my dream 
 Your silhouette in the doorway 
 But before you walk away 
 Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes 
 So that I always will remember 
 Frozen in time, always be mine 
 Baby boy you'll be young forever 
 I'll be over here, you'll be over there 
 I'ma shed a tear but I really don't care 
 Frozen in time, always be mine 
 Baby boy you'll be young forever 
 This is my last cry 
 Is this the only way? 
 This is my own prison 
 I'm frozen in time, in time, in time 
 Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes

 Like I ain't s'posed to step on this shit like King Kong 
 See as a child I was born with an old soul 
 See I would breath heavy, flame would shoot out of my nose hole (ha, ha) 
 So much shit, diapers love to play with matches 
 And drink all the fluid outta lighters 
 From when I was a child I knew that most of y'al was 
 Was diggin my news and watching biggest bugger 
 Loose in the head, like fuck what the law says 
 Might be the mental with the permanent wrinkle in my forehead 
 Boys head beef if you wanted to peak lane 
 Murder niggas with the fire then bounce through a heat game 
 Tie you up like bikes to a rail 
 And with your little cheap chain 
 And uncomfortable hang you from the side of a building 
 Till see you been lame? 
 Yo why'd you cut it off for? 
 Don't you see what I'm doing to this shit 
 Supposed to know how I'm directing these flicks 
 And everywhere was you getting on the remix 
 Cause this is something I've fathered and mastered 
 And plastered till they started calling me sick bastard 
 I'm drastic when it comes to reminding you 
 Who's responsible for the classic 
 And I burn a whole in the street like a was acid 
 Everytime I jump on the beat this shit get tragic 
 While you getting your ass kicked 
 Like a kick and a punch laps like two chops 
 Kinda like pong ping 
 But ? freedom until he thinking he Tupac 
 We both ?, rope 'em and them drag 'em a few blocks (horrible) 
 Uh uh uh, the muscle of the street move 
 Part of me, ugh 
 Suffering the beat 
 Ugh, take an elbow and scuffle in the heat 
 Like a nigga that was grinding and was hustling for weeks 
 So I rush the rush than I black 
 Then I came through when I gave the streets crack 
 Controlling the function, throughout despair 
 Everybody put your muthafucking hands in the air 
 That's how I do 'em 
 I do the kind of shit you can't imagine 
 You are one of the nicest and I ain't bragging 
 I make 'em all surrender till they see white flags 
 And they recognize I'm the original dungeon dragon 
 Rah rah, like a dungeon dragon 
 Change your fucking drawers cause your pants are sagging 
 Try to step to this, I will twist you in a turban 
 And have you smelling rank, like some old stale urine"

 A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame 
 Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain 
 An eraser for a head, fucking pencil for a frame 
 You don't like it then peel off bitch 
 Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off 
 And I still wouldn't fuck you, slut 
 So wipe the smile on your grill off 
 I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off 
 Get the wheels turning, spin a wheel off 
 Snap the axel in half, bust the tie-rod 
 Quit hollering ""Why, God?"" 
 He ain't got shit to do with it 
 Bygones will never be bygones 
 So won't be finished swallowing my wad 
 I ain't finished blowing it, nice bra 
 Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch 
 Life's hard, I swear to God 
 Life is a dumb blonde white broad with fake tits and a bad dye job 
 Who just spit in my f-cking face and called me a f-cking tightwad 
 So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod 
 And caught her stealing my music 
 So I tied her arms and legs to the bed 
 Set up the camera and pissed twice on her 
 Look, two pees and a tripod!

 Kick it back in its face, my God

 Boy, I got every award but a Heisman 
 Do a drive by on you niggas, make a U-turn for survivors 
 Take a newborn from his Momma, stick a shoe horn in vaginas 
 Got the coupe on Yokohamas, got the super soaker chopper 
 We'll kidnap the kingpin, like ""Who is your supplier?""

 Do the creep (ha)

 And if you wanna make friends at the ATM 
 Do the creep (ho) 
 Do the creep (ha) 
 Well, we got a new dance so get up on your feet 
 It's real easy to do, and it's called 'The creep' 
 Let your hands flap around like a Marionette 
 Pop your knees up and down, sh sh shaking your neck 
 Now pull your waistband up like you expectin' a flood 
 And slick your hair down flat like it was covered in mud 
 Trim up your pencil mustache and pop them peepers 
 Put this in your speakers, you a certified creeper. 
 When you see a country peach, laying out at the beach 
 Do the creep (ha) 
 Do the creep (ha) 
 And when a fine PYT walks in front of your tree 
 Do the creep (ho) 
 Do the creep (ha) 
 I was six years old when I started creepin' 
 My parents took it to their room and I started peepin' 
 You can't imagine their surprise when they lifted their heads 
 And saw my little ass creepin' at the foot of the bed 
 Yeah they knew I was a creep, since the day I was born 
 Poppin' out my momma like some kettle corn 
 Yeah the doctor caught my head and he started freakin' 
 'Cause I came out clean, and I came out creepin'! 
 Nicki, 
 Nicki, 
 Nicki, Nicki, Nicki 
 Nicki! 
 When I was a girl, I creeped in the boys' locker room 
 Hide deep inside, it was my little creep stalker room 
 As they disrobed, I was oogling and oggling 
 Little did they know, that for me, they were modeling 
 And I would laugh, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha, ha. 
 And they would dance, la la la la la la la, la. 
 So pop pop pop your peepers, 
 And tweak out your sneakers 
 Don't sleep, come on get your creep on with me! 
 Go on, get to sweatin' off a bride at her wedding 
 Do the creep (ha) 
 And do the creep (ha) 
 And when you sneak into a wake, and you see a beefcake 
 Do the creep (hoo) 
 And do the creep (ha) 
 And when the judge is a hottie and you can't control your body 
 Do the creep (ha) 
 Do the creep (ha) 
 So, get your knees flexin', and your arms T-rexin', 
 And creep (ho) 
 Do the creep! (ha) 
 And don't forget to smile!"

 I see you in here dancing 
 Your preview is quite romantic 
 I envy your perfect kind of life 
 Who knew you'd be so sexy? 
 I think you're quite fantastic 
 Screw your flaws 
 You're perfect in my eyes 
 And maybe I'm naive for loving you 
 You're a cheat and a liar 
 But tonight you're everything I desire 
 You beautiful sinner 
 I love your wicked heart 
 Beautiful sinner 
 It's such a work of art 
 I didn't know that bad could look so good 
 You are the type of bad that feels so good 
 Beautiful sinner 
 I bet you're heart of stone 
 Living in your world alone 
 I hope you let me in tonight 
 They want me to beware 
 You're dangerous, I don't care 
 I can't wait to have you in my arms 
 And maybe I'm naive for loving you 
 You're a cheat and a liar 
 But tonight you're everything I desire 
 You beautiful sinner 
 I love your wicked heart 
 Beautiful sinner 
 It's such a work of art 
 I didn't know that bad could look so good 
 You are the type of bad that feels so good 
 You're a beautiful sinner 
 Maybe your the master of disguise 
 And you are put it on and 
 Your really the saint that could walk 
 Are you here to save me from the crowd? 
 If you are then baby take me now 
 You beautiful sinner 
 I love your wicked heart 
 Beautiful sinner 
 It's such a work of art 
 I didn't know that bad could look so good 
 You are the type of bad that feels so good 
 You're a beautiful sinner"

 Searching for a winner but I didn't see it in her 
 Now I've gone from a zero to a super-hero-oh-oh 
 Whoa, whoa 
 Chasing dreams got me all over the World 
 Now I'm sitting on top of the World 
 We winning, we winning 
 'Cause we sitting on top of the World 
 This is for the little girls that say Nicki you pretty 
 When you come to the city you don't act high for Diddy? 
 You be up on the block, posted up in the drop 
 And everybody get up in whether you like it or not 
 But how them girls blow up but don't come to the hood 
 How they turn they nose up like they don't come from the hood 
 Most of them be in sight till it's time to pitch 
 That's when everything they write be a contradiction 
 I tell 'em I do it for the love 
 I do it for the hugs 
 I do it for the buzz 
 I do it for the thugs 
 I do it for the rich 
 I do it for the poor 
 I do it for the kids that can't do no more

 When I'm granting they wishes they be passing they digits 
 They be up on the block, getting screwed by the cops 
 Cuttin' school gettin' knocked whether they like it or not 
 They'll break in your door, might break in your jaw 
 They'll bring back a lye if you bring them an O 
 But what you really ain't know they airborne for stardom 
 With the ball in the gardens, stand tall, no dodgin' 
 No matter the squadron, lieutenant or sergeant 
 Air Force, the army, air force and army fatigues is on em 
 No heats is on 'em 
 Cause grandmamma prayed that he'd leave the corner. 
 (Nicki Minaj - Chorus) 
 I remember when I lost everything in a fire 
 Now I got fire, 23's almost higher 
 Shout outs to my brothers Jelani and Makiah 
 Thanks to the Messiah, my money getting higher 
 One time for my niggas that be huggin' the block 
 2 Times for my niggas that be ducking the cops 
 3 Times for my girls that pushing they own rides 
 Stooshing they own rides from bitches they don't like 
 Sometimes you get mad, wanna blaze the gun 
 I see you without a man, might erase ya son 
 Well look, when you blow up, everybody go shudder 
 This goes out to everybody on the come up
