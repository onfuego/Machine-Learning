 I'd wheel and deal anything for my baby 
 Oh 
 I'm in love and it feels so good 
 'Cause I need her 
 Don't mistreat her 
 And I tell her so 
 When I saw her and she looked my way 
 I was lonely 
 She's my only 
 And I've gotta say 
 That I would steal anything for my baby 
 I'd wheel and deal anything for my baby 
 Crawl or kneel, anything for my baby 
 In the morning when I raise my head 
 She's beside me 
 She can hide me 
 When I'm feelin' low 
 If I'm thinkin' everything's all wrong 
 My girl shakes me 
 She awakes me 
 Then I really know 
 That I would steal anything for my baby 
 I'd wheel and deal anything for my baby 
 Crawl or kneel, anything for my baby 
 Don't you know that 
 I would steal anything for my baby 
 I would wheel and deal anything for my baby 
 I would crawl or kneel, anything for my baby 
 I'd do anything 
 I would give anything for my baby 
 I would die or live, anything for my baby 
 I would t-t-t-t-take or give anything for my baby 
 Yes, I would take anything for my baby 
 I would build or break anything for my baby 
 I would rob or take anything for my baby 
 I would do anything for my baby 
 I would steal anything for my baby 
 I would wheel and deal"

 And when the world looks bad 
 She's never ever sad 
 She's so easy to please and it doesn't take money, no, no 
 We can have a good time when the skies aren't sunny 
 Ah, I love her all I can and try and understand 
 The things that make her glad 
 The things that make her sad

 Nine o'clock, the radio's the only light 
 I hear my song and it pulls me through 
 Comes on strong, tells me what I gotta do 
 I got to

 Everybody's gonna move their feet 
 (Get down!) 
 Everybody's gonna leave their seat 
 You gotta lose your mind in Detroit Rock City

 Getting late, I just can't wait 
 Ten o'clock and I know I gotta hit the road 
 First I drink, then I smoke 
 Start the car and I try to make the midnight show 
 (Get up!) 
 Everybody's gonna move their feet 
 (Get down!) 
 Everybody's gonna leave their seat 
 Movin' fast, down 95 
 Hit top speed but I'm still movin' much too slow 
 I feel so good, I'm so alive 
 Hear my song playin' on the radio 
 It goes 
 (Get up!) 
 Everybody's gonna move their feet 
 (Get down!) 
 Everybody's gonna leave their seat 
 Twelve o'clock, I gotta rock 
 There's a truck ahead, lights starin' at my eyes 
 Oh my God, no time to turn 
 I got to laugh 'cause I know I'm gonna die 
 Why?

 Everybody's gonna move their feet

 As we cross the starry sea 
 Powered by what we see 
 Now and then, the victory

 There's a place in the desert where an ocean once danced by 
 There's a song in the silence weaving in and out of time 
 We are notes in the music searching for remembered rhyme 
 On a mountain high somewhere 
 Where only heroes dare 
 Stand the stallion and the mare 
 We have been and we shall be 
 Each other's destiny

 He fought the lies, fought back the tears, can't wait to hear that starting gun 
 There ain't nobody gonna step on his dreams 
 So he held his hands high and screamed 
 Get me out of this rock and roll hell, take me far away 
 Get me out of this rock and roll hell 
 Get me out of this rock and roll hell, I need to get away 
 Get me out of this rock and roll hell 
 He's on the edge, he can feel it in his heart 
 This time the pressure's really on 
 He's gonna fight it, might even steal a guitar 
 This time tomorrow he'll be gone 
 There ain't nobody gonna tell him what to do 
 Think he's a little like me and you 
 Get me out of this rock and roll hell, take me far away 
 Get me out of this rock and roll hell 
 Get me out of this rock and roll hell, I need to get away 
 Get me out of this rock and roll hell 
 He's on the run, won't stand for second place, but his turn may never come 
 He's not a victim, you can see it in his face 
 But he can't see what he's become 
 Well, he wants it bad, but he wants no charity 
 He seems to think it's his destiny 
 Get me out of this rock and roll hell, I need to get away 
 Get me out of this rock and roll hell 
 Get me out of this rock and roll hell, take me far away 
 Get me out of this rock and roll hell

 Tell me what's the bottom line 
 Tell me 
 I just wanna take my turn 
 Now before I crash and burn 
 Yeah 
 Hope 
 A candle burning bright 
 A temporary light 
 Till we return tonight 
 Love 
 The mighty drug we crave 
 The master and the slave 
 Will rule us to our grave 
 Everytime I see a sign 
 Tell me what's the bottom line 
 Tell me 
 I just want a place to rest 
 Count to four and catch my breath 
 One, two, three, four 
 I don't know what to feel 
 Don't know what to say 
 Don't know what to do 
 I don't know where to go 
 Don't know who to be

 Is never what it seems 
 It shakes you from your dreams 
 Wake up and start to

 I hear the angels singing softly to me 
 Time's the enemy that you never see 
 Won't you come and slip away 
 I am only dreamin' 
 I'm only dreamin', oh

 In the beginning there was darkness and there was light 
 At the dawn of creation there was fear in the dead of night 
 There was thunder, there was flame 
 The whole wide world is driving me insane 
 Don't wanna run, don't wanna hide 
 I keep the fire burnin' deep inside 
 I howl at the moon, I pray to the sun 
 I've got a one way ticket to kingdom come 
 I'm goin' back to the Stone Age 
 I'm goin' back where I belong 
 I'm goin' back to the Stone Age 
 Back where I come from 
 Telling the world I'm goin' back where I belong 
 To a place where the sky is clear, the wind is strong 
 Climb the mountains, 'cross the seas 
 Clear my soul, I wanna be free 
 Sit on the throne, let 'em kiss the ring 
 'Cause I'm a Stone Age man, yeah

 Do your time, but there's no parole from here 
 No chance when the end is near 
 Hear the words that you never thought you'd hear, yeah

 Standing tall till you realize you're here 
 Look away, but you can't pretend
