 As I hold you 
 Now gone, I miss you 
 But I told you 
 I remember bad times 
 More than good 
 There's no coming back 
 Even if we could 
 I loved you to death 
 I loved you to death 
 If I can't have you 
 Then no one will 
 And since I won't 
 I'll have to kill 
 My only love, something 
 I've never felt 
 Now you've gone to heaven 
 And I'll burn in hell 
 I loved you to death 
 I loved you to death 
 I loved you to death 
 I loved you to death 
 Aww! 
 And now I'm down below 
 And what do I see 
 You didn't go to heaven 
 Your down here with me 
 And now coming back, 
 Baby, take me, please! 
 I really think I would 
 If you weren't such a sleaze 
 I loved you once before 
 You kept me on a string 
 I'd rather go without 
 Than take what you would bring 
 I loved you to death 
 Aww!"

 Paid assassin 
 Working after dark 
 Looking through the night 
 Using infra-red 
 My target on you 
 Aimed at your head 
 Ten thousand dollars up front 
 Ten thousand dollars when I'm through 
 And I know just what to do 
 And ya know I'll do it too 
 Then I'm coming back for you 
 Back for you! 
 I do the ""getting rid of"" 
 Don't tell me why 
 Don't need to hear the truth 
 Don't need the lies 
 Now pay me quickly 
 And now we're through 
 It brings me great pleasure 
 To say my next job is you

2,Megadeth,metal,Skull Beneath The Skin,"Mean and infectious, the evil prophets rise 
 Dance of the macabre, as witches streak the sky 
 Decadent worship of black magic sorcery 
 In the womb of the Devil's Dungeon, trapped without a plea, oh 
 Seething in agony, necrosis is the fate 
 Pins sticking through the skin, the venom now sedates 
 Locked in a pillory, nowhere to be found 
 Screaming for your life, but no one hears a sound, help me! 
 Prepare the patient's scalp to peel away 
 Metal caps his ears he'll hear not what we say 
 Solid steel visor riveted across his eyes 
 Iron staples close his jaws so no one hears his cries 
 The skull beneath the skin 
 The skull beneath the skin 
 Now you're drawn and quartered your bones will make the X 
 Symbol stands for poison and it's chained to your head 
 And as we fold your arms to make the holy cross 
 We cross the crucifix religion has been lost 
 The skull beneath the skin 
 The skull beneath the skin 
 The skull beneath the skin"

 Listen, I'm letting off steam 
 Now throw your hands in the air 
 Let it loose, I don't fucking care 
 Rattlehead 
 A dose of metal you need 
 To bang your head till you bleed 
 It's time for snapping some neck 
 Slashing, thrashing to Megadeth 
 Rattlehead 
 You, your head is pounding with pain 
 You shake loose parts of your brain 
 Winning, sinning, beginning 
 Feeding, the needing for bleeding 
 Bashing, smashing, crashing 
 Frying, annihilating you! 
 There's someone back in the shadows 
 You can't see his eyes 
 He'll bash your head if you cross him 
 Ain't quite your average guy 
 Don't wear no leather to ""fit in"" 
 Don't wear no spikes to be ""cool"" 
 Don't want no woman beside him 
 Just make it fast, loud and rude 
 Rattlehead 
 I'm a rattlehead 
 Rattle your goddamn head!"
4,Megadeth,metal,Chosen Ones,"You doubt your strength or courage 
 Don't come to join with me 
 For Death surely wants you 
 With sharp and pointy teeth 
 An animal so vicious 
 No others fought and won 
 So on the fields of battle 
 We are the chosen ones 
 Human bones blanket the dirt 
 Of the heathen's lair 
 That we must pass this den of death 
 The only path from here 
 But I walk in the light 
 The time to die has come 
 No one shall take my life 
 I'm of the chosen ones 
 Black shadows fill the sky 
 As the creatures eyes grow near 
 Raise the shield of the holy pilgrims 
 High into the air 
 Heaven's powers fill my arms 
 Onward now to fight I'm sent 
 Oh the beast is coming 
 To put you to the test 
 Look out! 
 Now this land is mine to pillage 
 Rape, and steal, and take at will 
 Never let you cross this path 
 I reign, for now, I stay to kill 
 You doubt your strength or courage 
 Don't come to join with me 
 For Death surely wants you 
 With sharp and pointy teeth 
 An animal so vicious 
 No others fought and won 
 So on the fields of battle 
 We are the chosen ones"
5,Megadeth,metal,Looking Down The Cross,"Now before they take me and my blessed life 
 Now you'll know why death was summoned here tonight 
 I'll recall my perils, they'll kill me in pride 
 No, I can't run away, there's no place to hide 
 Though too much to live for, I owe enough to die 
 Ask not for salvation, my death shall mean their lives 
 Hatred and guilt, the altar they've built, high priests of sin 
 Destiny, fate, the wicked one's gate beckoning you in 
 Down the walkways, through the blood stained town 
 Looking down the cross, bleeding from the crown 
 Led to stay to die besides the thieves 
 Kill the king of the world to be 
 And now to you, this will come 
 A putrifying pestilence 
 More noxious than the serpent's breath 
 Malevolently destined 
 More corrupt than the malice of choronzon 
 More diseased than the wind 
 Of the moonlight sun 
 Putrefaction you have caused 
 No need for confession 
 Now you wish you had a god to stop your demolition 
 Crushing the bones of the hundredfolds 
 Swinging the judgement hammer 
 Man, woman, child, no-one is safe 
 The heads of the dead are the banner 
 And this was all you got 
 So don these broken wings 
 Sands of time run out 
 Bells of Hades ring 
 Is this a nightmare 
 To unhallow thy name 
 Smell of brimstone 
 Dancing in the flames 
 No help now as you fulfill his task 
 Chief of evil has got you by the ass 
 Set free to sit upon the throne 
 Just a dream? 
 You're weeping all alone! 
 Looking down the cross 
 (Speak no evil) 
 I'm looking down the cross

 Behold the flames rise from the compasses' cardinal points 
 Burn the sacred oil and, with the ashes, you'll anoint 
 Arrange the symbols of the wizard and magician 
 Light the candles, place the parchment paper in position 
 Between its leaves, place the lash from a black cat's eye 
 A straw of a broom, fold and burn and centralize 
 Don't summon the devil 
 And don't call the priests

 That locks the door to this hell, the place they wanted me

 I recall that night, my every breath and step along the way 
 Closed my eyes, walking as danger paved the way 
 The devil and the darkness, let her evil wander free 
 Here on Devil's Island, the final stop for me 
 Devil's Island

 Oh, there is no escape, the sea is full of sharks 
 The tide takes you away and smashes you on the rocks 
 The sun is shining but feel not today 
 It's warmth, it's dying and fading away

 Here I stay, Devil's Island 
 Oh, hear the call from the grave beyond 
 Oh, so pernicious, her soul it creates song 
 As there is no man, that is here upon the earth 
 Labeled to terminate our noisome Lucifer 
 The priest that reads the sermons is walking next to me 
 To the stake, my last request to have her burn with me 
 And so it did, the heavens opened, rain began to fall 
 The final judgment came, and was spread before you all 
 Final judgment 
 Old, weak, and feeble and the lessons taught to me 
 To stay away from evil, she doesn't care for me 
 She haunts me in my sleep though I tore that page away 
 And here on Devil's Island, I'll always have to stay

 I mangle their faces till no features remain 
 A blade for the butchering, I cut them to shreds 
 First take out the organs, then cut off the head 
 Remains of flesh now sop under my feet 
 One more bloody massacre, the murder's complete 
 I seek to dismember a sadist fiend 
 Bloodbaths are my way of getting clean 
 I lurk in the alley, wait for the kill 
 I have no remorse for the blood that I spill

 Possessed, naive, his service is done 
 It's the Sabbath 
 Bloody Sabbath 
 Bad omen of the goat 
 Bloody blasphemy 
 Sinister's the word as the demon's take their fill 
 An orgy's taking place human blood will spill 
 An act of worship as they conceive the ghouls 
 Satan has their souls they sing pagan tunes 
 The ceremony is sure to be cursed 
 They wait for his blessings, but down comes the worst 
 Their bodies, soulless a corpse from the grave

 Highly polished metal, the oil makes it gleam 
 Fill the terror chamber, your mind begins to scream 
 Your life is like a trigger, never trouble till you're squeezed 
 Now you crack a smile, as you give the gun a tease 
 Place the pistol down, now give the gun a spin 
 Soon as the spinning stops, oh no, the game starts in 
 A hateful way of vengeance, a bit of playful sin 
 Load another bullet, now the second round begins 
 A couple grains of powder, a couple grams of lead 
 A touch against the trigger, a touch inside the head 
 Take another drink and raise the last bets 
 Think about my last words, they might be what I just said 
 A click comes from the hammer that couldn't drive a nail 
 Sense the numbing cold blue or the red of Hades' grill 
 A fraction of a second, do you lose or maybe still 
 Pass it to the left, and collect your mighty kill 
 Add another bullet, the third round begins 
 Soon as the spinning stops, oh no, the game starts in 
 Please, no I.O.U.'s, no markers for death 
 Does anybody play? 
 Anybody 
 Somebody 
 Everybody

 Distorted figures walk the street, it's 1999 
 Weeds once underneath your feet have grown to vines 
 Bodies melted like a candle, a land without a face 
 No time to change your fate, no time left, it's too late 
 The arsenal of Megadeth can't be rid, they said 
 And if it comes, the living will envy the dead 
 Racing for power and all come in last 
 No winning, first stone cast 
 This falsehood, worldly peace 
 It's treaties soon will cease 
 No one will be left to prove that humans existed 
 Maybe soon the children will be born open-fisted 
 We all live on one planet, it will all go up in smoke 
 Too bad they couldn't see this lethal energy 
 And now the final scene, a global darkening 
 Dig deep the piles of rubble and ruins 
 Towering overhead, both far and wide

 Dirt roads to interstates, I must have drove them all

 Loneliness is not only felt by fools 
 Alone I call to ease the pain 
 Yearning to be held by you, alone 
 So alone, I'm lost consumed by the pain 
 The pain 
 The pain

 Killing for religion, something I don't understand 
 Fools like me, who cross the sea and come to foreign lands 
 Ask the sheep, for their beliefs, do you kill on God's command? 
 A country that's divided, surely will not stand 
 My past erased, no more disgrace, no foolish naive stand 
 The end is near, it's crystal clear, part of the master plan 
 Don't look now to Israel, it might be your homelands 
 Holy wars 
 Upon my podium, as the know-it-all scholar 
 Down in my seat of judgment, gavel's bang, uphold the law 
 Up on my soapbox, a leader out to change the world 
 Down in my pulpit as the holier-than-thou could-be messenger of God 
 Wage the war on organized crime 
 Sneak attacks, rappel down the rocks, behind the lines 
 Some people risk to employ me 
 Some people live to destroy me 
 Either way they die 
 They die 
 They killed my wife and my baby with hopes to enslave me 
 First mistake, last mistake 
 Paid by the alliance to slay all the giants 
 Next mistake, no more mistakes 
 Fill the cracks in with judicial granite 
 Because I don't say it don't mean I ain't thinkin' it 
 Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts away 
 I know what I said, now I must scream of the overdose 
 And the lack of mercy killings, mercy killings 
 Mercy killings, killings, killings, killings 
 Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts away"

 Roach egg laying in my brain 
 Once stalked beneath your shadow 
 Sleepwalking to the gallows 
 I'm the sun that beats your brow in 
 'Til I finally threw the towel in 
 Never knowing if I'd wake up 
 In a whirlpool got redundant 
 My brain was just some driftwood 
 In a cesspool, I became dead

 Was my destiny, someone said 
 Loves a tidepool

 Drift into a deeper state, stalk the cobwebbed stairways 
 Dirt grits beneath my feet, the stair creaks, I precariously sneak, yeah 
 Hypnosis guides my hand, I slip-slide through the walkways 
 Sit in granny's rocking chair, memories are whirling by, yeah 
 Reminiscin' in the attic, Lucretia waits impatiently 
 Cobwebs make me squint, the cobra so eloquently glints 
 Moonbeams surge through the sky, the crystal ball is energized 
 Surely that, like the cat, waiting, Lucretia rocks away, hey"

 You'll hate me just the same

 Not from the tears, just self abuse

 The land of opportunity 
 The golden chance for me 
 My future looks so bright 
 Now I think I've seen the light 
 Can't say what's on my mind 
 Can't do what I really feel 
 In this bed I made for me 
 Is where I sleep, I really feel 
 I warn you of the fate 
 Proven true too late 
 Your tongue twist perverse 
 Come drink now of this curse 
 And now I fill your brain 
 I spin you round again 
 My poison fills your head 
 As I tuck you into bed 
 You feel my fingertips 
 You won't forget my lips 
 You'll feel my cold breath 
 It's the kiss of death"

 Chalklines and red puddles 
 Of those who have been slain 
 Destiny, that crooked schemer 
 Says the dead shall rise... Again! 
 Where do we go from here? 
 And should we really care? 
 The end is finally here 
 God have mercy! 
 Now we've rewritten history 
 The one thing we've found out 
 Sweet taste of vindication 
 It turns to ashes in your mouth 
 Where do we go from here? 
 And should we really care? 
 The end is finally here 
 God have mercy! 
 If you're fighting to live 
 It's O.K. to die! 
 The answer to your question is... 
 Welcome to tomorrow! 
 Where do we go from here? 
 God have mercy! 
 Where do we go from here? 
 And should we really care? 
 The end is finally here 
 God have mercy!"

 Dream up your pain 
 Drink as did bacchus 
 Rebel just like cain 
 Lord of the city 
 I shall remain 
 All pandemonium 
 I shall reign 
 Set in my fortress 
 Up on my hill 
 Drinking the wine 
 Till I've had my fill 
 Building up high 
 My castle walls 
 Oh to veil my splendid fall 
 I present you, I present to you 
 I present you, this crown of worms (2x) 
 Surrounding myself with misery 
 Drawn curtains heavy of my history 
 Exquisite I am perfect unity 
 On my left hand is false majesty 
 I feign affection, refute the true story 
 Dispute with creation, the lie is my glory 
 I care for no one, my gospel is death 
 For me the lights gone, only darkness is left 
 I present you, I present to you 
 I present you, this crown of worms (2x) 
 As black in deed 
 As cold as stone 
 A commandment of one 
 As proud as gold 
 As neglected in spirit 
 As time is old 
 As legion is numbers 
 As legend is told 
 I am alone with the agony of truth 
 My power of will 
 My judgement and chain 
 My end is knowledge 
 And conscience of guilt 
 My final confusion hidden from me till I'm done"

 I like the way that your stomach knots 
 And how you cry for it all to stop

 And make believe there's nobody else 
 I like the way that you stand in line

 And how you try to hold me down 
 But you end up driven to the ground

 Too wet to come in from the rain...

 Let me show you, how I love you,

 Don't wait to see what's next... 
 Thrown to the wolves forever trusting 
 Raised in a form of living hell. 
 Sing a one note song of rage 
 Live and die within your heart 
 So beware in the shadows, 
 Your family tree waits in the dark

63,Megadeth,metal,99 Ways To Die,"If I see the morning hours 
 I'll have one more yesterday 
 Take life from tomorrow 
 'Cause I've burned out my today 
 If I get up to the top I know 
 I'll just go back downhill 
 Got a terminal future 
 And it's time to write my will 
 Down another glass of courage 
 And a shot of thorazine 
 We're not ready to see you yet 
 Ninety-nine ways to die 
 We're not ready to see you yet 
 Got a short between the earphones 
 Wringing my hands in dismay 
 A more efficient maniac 
 With two feet in the grave 
 I ain't got no last words to say 
 Yellow streak right up my spine 
 The gun in my mouth was real 
 And the taste blew my mind 
 In a black tie and straight jacket 
 Man, I'm gonna try again 
 We're not ready to see you yet 
 Ninety-nine ways to die 
 We're not ready to see you yet 
 Demitasse of arsenic 
 Try on this tie 
 Never mind the tree 
 There is only death and danger 
 In the sockets of my eyes 
 A playground of illusion 
 No one plays, they only die 
 There's a prison in my mind 
 And the bars are gonna break 
 I'm as mad as a hatter 
 And strung out just the same 
 Taunting rigor mortis 
 I feel it draw me in 
 We're not ready to see you yet 
 Ninety-nine ways to die 
 We're not ready to see you yet"

 Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify 
 Can you help me? 
 Occupy my brain 
 Oh, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah 
 I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find 
 I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind 
 Make a joke and I will sigh, and you will laugh and I will cry 
 Happiness I cannot feel, so love to me is so unreal 
 And so, as you hear these words telling you now of my state 
 I tell you to enjoy life, I wish I could, but it's too late

 And rides the seven-headed beast 
 Ten diadems to crown them all

 This day will surely come 
 So, run my child and hide your face

 A solemn oath I make 
 Cross my heart, please let me sleep - I keep waking up 
 How much more do I take 
 My head is talking to me 
 I don't know what it needs 
 But the loudest voice 
 Is the one I heed 
 Insomnia, my swollen bloodshot eyes 
 Insomnia, awake 'til morning light 
 Insomnia, stirring deep inside 
 Insomnia, somebody turn out the lights 
 I can't sleep - insomnia 
 I'm twisting and turning - I keep waking up 
 The madness I must tame 
 My candle is burning - I keep waking up 
 Both ends again today 
 The whole house is creaking 
 I know they're out there 
 The things kept from sight 
 I beg to the shadows 
 I can't sleep 
 Insomnia, footsteps on the walk 
 Insomnia, I hear someone knock 
 Insomnia, I wish it was a dream 
 Insomnia, can you hear me scream"

 Nowhere left to find him 
 About to lose his lifeline

 Forgot who he is 
 Forgot who he was 
 Used to call the shots 
 Now he can't connect the dots 
 A mover and shaker 
 Getting closer to his maker 
 Lower than a hemline 
 Dancing on the breadline 
 No one there to bind him 
 Nothing to remind him 
 Nowhere left to find him 
 About to lose his lifeline 
 He's looking for a headline 
 Sniffing up the white lines 
 He's dancing on the breadline 
 Watch him dance 
 About to lose his lifeline 
 He's looking for a headline 
 Sniffing up the white lines

 The coat of arms falling 
 I hear the doctor calling 
 The family crest is falling 
 I hear the doctor calling 
 Always sharing trips 
 Remove me from your lips 
 Sight and mind still and never go away 
 One too many tantrums 
 Deviated symptoms 
 Better lock the phantom away 
 The coat of arms falling 
 I hear the doctor calling 
 The family crest is falling 
 I hear the doctor calling 
 I see the chalkline crawling 
 I hear the doctor calling me away 
 This place is my home 
 My mind still runs free 
 The doctor's prescription 
 Less for you and more for me

 I see the chalkline crawling 
 I hear the doctor calling me away 
 A merciful embalming 
 I hear the doctor calling me away"

 When nothing fits and nothing seems right

 We kept our pride through it all 
 We started screaming 
 When skies are dark, no sun shines through 
 I know I see the light in you 
 We stopped dreaming and started believing 
 I'll be there for you, when you walk through the fire 
 I'll be there for you, when the flames get higher 
 When nothing fits and nothing seems right

 To get past the Pearly Gates

 If I'm right, I lose nothing 
 If you're right, I lose it all 
 I oughta get caught 
 Because I'm doing something wicked 
 I'm guilty, haunted by my fears 
 And the only consequences 
 Are dread and the fugitive mind"
106,Megadeth,metal,Return To Hangar,"Welcome to an empty fortress 
 A mighty wreck that once was proud 
 Ate alive by oxidation 
 Abandoned by a crew of cowards 
 Navigation systems failed 
 Computers crashed and they all fall down 
 Possibly I've seen too much 
 Hangar 18 I know too much 
 All the guilty paid the price 
 Suspended by their broken necks 
 No one survived to tell the story 
 When foreign life forms resurrect 
 And military intelligence is 
 Still two words that can't make sense 
 Possibly I've seen too much 
 Hangar 18 I know too much"
107,Megadeth,metal,When,"No one hears a word I say 
 And my prayers are never answered 
 But you'll never see the pain inside of me 
 Stabbing me over and over and over 
 I trusted you and I loved you 
 And you spit back in my face 
 How could you do this to me? 
 When will you stop trying to hurt me? 
 I've walked a minefield for you 
 A career in hell with you 
 I have made it through the things 
 Others would surely die just watching 
 And the oath I take on this day 
 Is to know that you will be repaid 
 One day the the sun will die and the night will crawl 
 Until then, until I see your world implode 
 I wish you death and suffering 
 Misery to spare 
 Time to rehearse your pain 
 Face the last enemy 
 I am the last thing you will know 
 The last thing you will see 
 I see your death surrounding me 
 I know you, yes I do 
 I know you 
 When no words are spoken and pleas are ignored 
 Your tears go unnoticed, will you say enough? 
 When prayers are unanswered and your calls are unheard 
 The pain cuts right through you, have you seen enough? 
 It all seems so deceitful and the verdict is lies 
 A black cloud of indecision compromised your life 
 When judgement has failed you 
 When your own heart's impaled you 
 Your wandering mind has destroyed you 
 Will you ever know when? 
 When you give everything and the feeling is gone 
 All the giving is fake, did you fake enough? 
 When you take everything and you stay too long 
 When there's nothing left, did you take enough?"
108,Megadeth,metal,Coming Home,"And today, I leave you 
 But I'll be back someday

 I will miss you 
 But I know 
 I know you know 
 I'm coming home to Arizona 
 I'm coming home to Arizona 
 I'll take you everywhere I go 
 I'll show you everything I see 
 And as we say so long 
 I know your tears wish me well 
 It won't be long till I'm back again 
 We will meet again 
 We will meet again 
 You will see, oh 
 I'm coming home to Arizona 
 I'm coming home"

 This is breaking news 
 It appears that Air Force One was shot down 
 Somewhere over the Middle East this morning 
 By a sleeper cell of rogue terrorists firing a Stinger Missile 
 The Pilot and all passengers are unaccounted for 
 The President's whereabouts are presently unknown and he is presumed missing 
 The Vice President, Secretary of State, and principals of the military are assembling 
 Our nation stands at DEFCON 3 
 The greatest crisis, will someone come for me? 
 I ""red, white and blew it"" 
 Unleashed revenge, my body is detained 
 How could anybody do this? 
 Betrayal, I peel away the days 
 Medals are useless, Uncle Sam's forgotten me 
 I'm not important, no one will ever come 
 I'll never be found, God get me out of this hell 
 Nuclear battlefields energized 
 Cold wars are heating up again 
 The tensions mounting 
 People lift up your fists in revenge 
 The stage is set 
 Who will be the first to blink? 
 We can't go to war 
 Remember that ""Vietnam thing"" 
 Peace at any price 
 With a gun to your head, bang, bang 
 Weakness runs in your family 
 What runs in mine is death 
 This is your 5 minute warning 
 Burn all of your classified documents 
 And if cooler heads don't prevail 
 First strike from a political dead man 
 Appeasement only makes the aggressor more aggressive 
 He understands only one language - action 
 And he respects only one word - force 
 No sign of them stopping, no time for back channel communiques 
 We need all the help we can get, air strikes and invasions, retaliate, I say! 
 The will of good men can not counter the terrible strain of war 
 Blackmail the universe with the greatest of calamities 
 Awaken those sleeping giants in the dust of the ground 
 With their skin destroyed, unjust to innocence 
 Lawful possessor of the world's last 24 hours 
 Terror and ugliness reveal what death really means 
 And in hatred you see men as they really are 
 If chosen over heaven, Earth will have been for them 
 All along, only another region of hell"

 How I could walk away from something so rare 
 But you see it all got too demanding, yeah 
 And I just didn't care, I just didn't care, if I cared, if I cared 
 Lately, I've been left wanting, but not wanting you 
 Attraction that once was is no longer there, ooh 
 And it sucks to be taken for granted 
 When the veil is drawn and there's only air 
 I had to walk away 
 Give up something I love 
 For what I loved even more 
 And save my tears for you 
 Everything has lost its meaning; I had to let it go 
 To find myself, myself, and start something new, brand new 
 Forced to look deep in the mirror, face who I really am 
 Now it's just me, 'cause I can't afford you 
 I had to walk away 
 Give up something I love 
 For what I loved even more 
 And save my tears for you 
 I gave up something I loved 
 For what I loved even more 
 And I saved my tears for you 
 In a vial and walked away 
 You were so beautiful to look upon 
 I could see the light in your smile 
 Your eyes were the windows into your soul 
 Your body was heavenly just like the sky 
 Until all your good looks betrayed you, which ain't much 
 Counted on your counterfeit smiles for too long 
 Your eyes are empty windows: broken 
 The body may be here, but the soul is gone 
 I saved my tears for you in a vial 
 From everything wicked thing that you did, that you said 
 To send away, buried with your love 
 So many tears in a vial, now that you're gone, and now that you're dead"

 New York back to LA

 Leave a path of metal 
 Across the world from stage to stage 
 Well that was back in the day 
 And if you weren't there 
 It doesn't matter anyway

 In denim and leather 
 We were all part of one force 
 Knocked Rock and Roll on its ass 
 And put metal on the course 
 Higher! 
 Higher! 
 Higher! 
 Higher! 
 Back in the day 
 You weren't there 
 It doesn't matter 
 Because you wouldn't understand 
 This is our way of life 
 A life that was born free 
 To follow orders how to live 
 Was never meant to be 
 Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh 
 Peals of thunder, sheets of lighting 
 The power hits the stage 
 The music was exciting 
 The mania raged 
 On, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh 
 We all had the fever 
 Our ears started to ring 
 Feeding this wildfire 
 Consuming everything 
 Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh

116,Megadeth,metal,Something That I'm Not,"Your mind tells you that you've lost your confidence 
 You're drifting and ya don't believe in anyone 
 To lose what little you have left to be proud of 
 Afraid you can't do this again, ah! 
 You said that nothing come in-between us 
 The way of getting things we wanted done 
 Then enissophobia held you under its influence 
 Until you compromised your style 
 Everything about you has been one big charade 
 What will you do now that the well's run dry? Cry? 
 To sell out all your friends and stab them in the back 
 It's something that you are; it's something that I'm not 
 When you forced me into doing what you love 
 Mark my words no one loves you very much, yeah mark em' 
 And when you tried to change me and tried to replace me 
 I couldn't help but end just hating you, hmm! 
 Being a fraud can only last so long, you should know 
 Till what ya sensed as a child returns, you little baby 
 To choke out the voice that told ya ""money and the fame"" 
 Would fill the crater that you dug for yourself 
 Unlike you I'm no vision to myself, lest you forget 
 You didn't ever make metal, buddy; metal made you 
 To crush and run over everyone along the way 
 It's something that you are; it's something that I'm not 
 A stranger to yourself, ha! ya pissed me off again 
 I won't be driven by your needs anymore 
 What you'd become to do or be is clear to see for me 
 It's something that you are; something that I'm not 
 It makes me sick to hear you say you ""love me"" 
 I know you only love what I can do for you 
 If you were the one that was leading the charge 
 Would you notice if I missed a day or two? But that's impossible! 
 We all laughed at the parodies that you'd become 
 Now your pain slowly paid back has begun 
 So, accept my resignation, or in your words ""betrayal"" 
 Before it gets much worse, end this self-sabotage 
 Something that I'm not, something that you are, something I'm not 
 Something that I'm not, something that you are, something I'm not 
 Something that you are, something I'm not, yet"

 Truth be told - Sin lies at the doorway 
 Truth be told - Hell's open for business now 
 Truth be told - The soil cries out for revenge 
 Truth be told - And death is upon the ground 
 All around 
 The battle ain't over without spoils of war 
 Just cause it is written does not make it so 
 When you dance with the devil wait till the song's over 
 I ask myself, how bad do I want you to live?' 
 My anger is near, till the last

 Truth be told - Hell's open for business now 
 Truth be told - The soil cries out for revenge 
 Truth be told - And death is upon the ground

 Tribulation strikes and we're hit hard 
 Still you just go on your way 
 Head in the sand, ignoring the rain 
 Just like the flood in Noah's day 
 In his day 
 Can't punish those ruining the earth 
 It's suicide to some degree 
 Because we are all guilty, guilty as sin 
 There will be no peace, never for you and for me 
 Before al Qaeda and Bin Laden 
 Long before Hitler and Hussein 
 Ever since the first murder was committed 
 The verdict's always been the same 
 The cursed future just repeats the past 
 There's hell to pay and stones to cast 
 So, there will be no peace, never be peace

 I could make it in this scene 
 To be a rising star that only gleamed 
 But all the answers disagreed 
 With the questions held for me 
 I was legal now at twenty-one 
 I knew the way the world should run 
 My God just look what I had done 
 Simply drunk and having fun 
 Looked for friends, but I found none 
 All alone at twenty-one

 The fire burns on and on 
 That drives me on till all is gone 
 Except the simple plans

 At twenty-five I was surprised 
 That I was still even half alive 
 Somehow I managed to survive 
 I felt my body's doing time 
 And In my back a hundred knives 
 From friends at twenty-five 
 And now as Gabriel sounds my warning bell 
 I'd buy your life, if you would sell 
 A year or two, if less compelled 
 So live your life and live it well 
 There's not much left of me to tell 
 I just got back up each time I fell 
 The fire burns on and on 
 That drives me on till all is gone 
 Except the simple plans 
 Of mice and men 
 The fire burns on and on 
 That drives me on till all is gone

 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death

 I never knew how empty my soul was until it was refilled 
 Mad distemper strikes both beggars and Kings

 I am given the right to bear arms and power to meet justice

 Suffer the trespasses that you made 
 I will drink your pain away 
 Forever and a day

 Out my name

 Even whisper it 
 When you feel there's something wrong 
 I shelter you and keep you warm 
 I never let you walk alone 
 I loved you when you still hated me 
 I'm coming and I won't be long 
 It's time to reap what I have sown 
 Never ever let you walk alone 
 I know your enemy once was me

125,Megadeth,metal,United Abominations,"Within striking distance from Ground Zero sits a smoldering international cauldron, the United ""Abominations"" as it were. Born to prevent wars, it froze in the face of disaster, and stood silent while terrorization took hostage the world. 
 In a mire of hypocrisy, ignores sex crimes by its blue helmets, and enables terrorism, so in the end, it has failed. And the UN is where our so-called friends get to stab us in the back, and we pay 22% of their tab to host our enemies here at home. 
 Ambassadors from countries otherwise known as ""The Catastrophe"" enjoy Diplomatic immunity, living in Manhattan, while their children are turned into prostitutes. It's a complete and utter disgrace! A blot on the face of humanity! And they get away with it!?! 
 Poverty in their kitchens 
 Held hostage by oil-for-food 
 Yet their own plates are full off the fat of their lands 
 There's no blood on their hands, right Gojo? 
 They promised to tell the truth 
 Without leaving a fingerprint. 
 They will lose the UN one way or another. 
 The victim, I fear will be us, sisters and brothers! 
 The UN is right; you can't be any more ""un"" 
 Than you are right now, the UN is undone. 
 Another mushroom cloud, another smoking gun. 
 The threat is real, the Locust King has come. 
 Don't tell me the truth; I don't like what they've done. 
 It's payback time, at the United Abominations. 
 A grave and gathering danger 
 The decision to attack 
 Based on secret intelligence, it'll take years 
 I fear to undo the failings in Iraq. 
 You may bury the bodies 
 But you can't bury the crimes. 
 Only fools stand up and really lay down their arms 
 No, not me, not when Death lasts forever 
 The UN is right; you can't be any more ""un"" 
 Than you are right now, the UN is undone. 
 Another mushroom cloud, another smoking gun.

 This glorious brainwashing where prejudice lies 
 Like a crouching tiger 
 Tormenting peasants till they erect an army 
 Under everyone's nose

 Turned into a pink mist when they blew to smithereens 
 We are just a war away from Amerikhastan 
 When God versus god; the undoing of man 
 Promising a vapor, in the end they become one 
 No rules of engagement, this enemy hides 
 Amongst women and children 
 And to beat violence, you must ignore the focus groups 
 You must send in the Mossad, turn off the BBC, CNN 
 And don't look back

 There'll be no more Middle East!

 One day I'll dance on you grave 
 Even if you're buried at sea 
 Till then, till when I exact my revenge 
 I'll tell them, ""You're dead to me""

 You think they'd notice what we're trying to do 
 These wounds are invisible 
 Underneath the dirt I still see the scars 
 Back then when things got bad 
 And we spread our wings and fly away 
 You'll take all your riches in the back of a hearse 
 Your time is going to come

 For that next bowl, he'd sell his soul 
 Spiral to destruction, it's too late to break the spell 
 He wants the ride to stop on the freight train straight to hell 
 Without the truth he'll never find in a dungeon of his lies 
 His cause of death... high speed on burnt ice 
 Always looking at the ground, a broken beaten man 
 Memories of his family are calling after him 
 He can hardly think, hardly walk

 But he's dead if he does 
 Shadow people follow him everywhere he goes 
 Looking over his shoulder, the paranoia grows"

 It always starts out psychedelic, and then it turns to black 
 My head starts swaying, I forgot what it was that I was saying 
 I don't know where I am, and I'll never, never make it back 
 I sealed my fate, and I paid my debt 
 I fell from grace with deep regret

 With confidence I tread through the dead of the night 
 Off to another wartorn, faraway battlefield 
 Wherein lies a daemonic enemy horde 
 On this day I desire to anoint my fists 
 Engaging them in the mode of power and war 
 Stopping at nothing that's short of fulfilling my destiny 
 Willing to die and I will, after you for what I believe 
 A desperate avenger striking fear in their hearts 
 Invading their dreams before the day even starts 
 Whet with your blood, I sharpen my sword 
 No turning the other cheek like a coward 
 Come tomorrow, I may lay down and die 
 But not this day 
 Sent on an unholy quest, to reduce all those who resist 
 To the size of their shriveled up souls and scatter them like grist 
 I vanquished the strangleholds that the netherworld sets for me 
 The last request of my life is to die killing my enemies 
 Bathed in blood up to the horse's bridle 
 It's death to retreat, there's no chance of survival 
 Whet with your blood, I sharpen my sword 
 No turning the other cheek like a coward 
 Come tomorrow I may lay down and die 
 But not this day, this day we fight! 
 This day we fight! 
 Strip the fallen heroes, finish off the wounded 
 Collect the spoils of war and send them back dead 
 This day we fight!

 Armor piercing, fully automatic weapons

 Forty-four minutes of target practice, all hell's breaking loose 
 Outgunned, watching ""The Force""

 Getting schooled until they shot Achilles' heel 
 And brought down the beast 
 This was an accident waiting to happen 
 It wasn't IF it would happen, it was WHEN 
 The city's people sabotaged themselves 
 Calling their firepower an unneeded expense 
 The two most violent men it seemed couldn't be stopped 
 Standard police issue guns were just not enough 
 But SWAT arrived and settled the fight 
 Between AK-47 and AR-15

 No one will ever miss a menace to society 
 A gross lack of potential, bad decisions made in spite 
 A touchy hairpin trigger and such a wasted life 
 Trying to break the mold of a broken family 
 Fighting damn sure failure, and living on his knees 
 Guilty of the crime of nonconformity 
 A hanging judge and jury handing down the penalty 
 A lethal injection, now they watch the body jerk 
 Exterminate the problem, except it didn't work 
 No vital sign of life, they declared it wasn't there 
 Coroner never checked, because he didn't fucking care 
 Passing off the body, they all believe he died 
 Starting up the hearse, set out for a final drive 
 Like whistling past a graveyard, when walking by at night 
 It's a fatal illusion to think that evil ever dies 
 In a darkened mortuary, reeking of formaldehyde 
 Aroused from deadly slumber, something opened up his eyes 
 Spilling all their blood was a promise that he'd keep 
 Hate so strong revived him from a deep necrotic sleep 
 Clawing away the casket lid until his fingers bleed 
 He grabbed a knife and set out on a vivisection spree 
 A butcher, hell bent, massacring each one with his blade 
 From the first one to the last, he dispatched them to the grave 
 It's a fatal illusion... 
 Evil never dies 
 It never dies"

 A token gift, destroyers deep within its hold 
 Revenge of patient men is sweet and best served cold 
 The enemy inside the belly of the beast 
 A mighty Trojan horse, tonight the sentries sleep 
 On the march... No place to run 
 Time has come... No where to hide 
 The moon is red... No one is safe 
 From spilling blood... no living thing survives 
 Here they fight... regretting nothing 
 Here you die... the walls are caving in 
 Nothing left... a lethal encounter 
 Its judgment time... when death comes from within 
 Warning signs ignored, they have all but been denied 
 Prophets and messengers, mocked and vilified 
 Final destination lying deep inside their court 
 Their first line of defense soon became their last resort 
 Hardened deceivers entered through their open gates 
 Silent trained assassins, lying still, in wait 
 You look so perfect, but everybody knows 
 Their petrified to say the emperor has no clothes 
 So bloody perfect, but everybody knows 
 Their just so petrified, the emperor has no clothes

 The taste, touching his tongue, sweet to his lips 
 Poison, now penetrating deeper 
 Betrayed by just one bite, for just one night 
 To find forbidden fruit tastes sweeter 
 Just like pressing a loaded gun to your head 
 One knows only the spider can navigate its web 
 She had to know, know, know... he'd get what he wants 
 He had to know, know, know... she'd get what she needs 
 Soon under the spell, emotions are high 
 Mind control penetrating deeper 
 The hex was cast on him, all he believes 
 Now is forbidden fruit tastes sweeter 
 She had to know, know, know... he'd win at the start 
 He had to know, know, know... she'd win in the end 
 His one last thought blew his mind, bullet to the brain 
 Hot lead was penetrating deeper 
 Just one reckless shot squeezed from the hand 
 That knows forbidden fruit tastes sweeter"

 Of failing us on purpose, to culturally sanitize 
 Its opiates for the masses under cloak as hope and change 
 The ""new normal"" or just more of the same?

 Must have an alibi 
 And the perfect pawn 
 To spew the party line 
 Of the perfect falsehood

 To lead its path up to meet us

 Ask yourself; do I really want this bad enough?

 Each one just waiting for you to wash out

 The world is yours to take, abandon your ""plan B"" 
 Seize everything you've ever wanted

 I heard somebody turned to dust

 Songs that never will be sung 
 These are the thinge he won't get done

 I've seen them crawl from the cradle to the gutter on their hands 
 They fight a war but it's fatal, it's so hard to understand 
 I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle use that man 
 Just one shot to say goodbye 
 One last taste to mourn and cry 
 Scores and shoots, the lights go dim 
 Just one shot to do him in 
 He hangs his head and wonders why 
 Why the monkey only lies 
 But pay the pauper, he did choose 
 He hung his head inside the noose 
 I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle use that man 
 I've seen them crawl from the cradle to the coffin on their hands 
 They fight a war but it's fatal, it's so hard to understand

 Alien abductors are taking over Nuquledom, having slain humans and extrater- 
 Restrial beings by stalking brains and facing fear amongst the farest areas 
 Of this dreadful plante, the torture affecting their fate will be destroyed 
 By sinister extraterrestrial masterminds - eventually destroying the whole 
 Planet, not only by chance, but by nuclear annihilation."" 
 ""As the solar system evolves into one curiosity-conscious force of death, 
 The end of the world will take place for 3,450 years and 2,700 centuries...

 What we have done in our battle for semantic freedom 
 We hold the hands of the cranial clock of evil

 What happens to the planetary straits affecting our society 
 Shoot back at torture and run all fear around 
 Not for the sake of heart, making for the last guy abound 
 Shoot back at the enemy behind enemy lines

 Not by force, but by abduction 
 Face your intergalatic fears, vying to face destruction

 'Cause I wanna be anarchy 
 'Cause I wanna be anarchy 
 You know what I mean 
 'Cause I wanna be anarchy 
 Anarchist 
 Destroy"
187,Megadeth,metal,Intro/Rattlehead,"(Talking) 
 Oh, here I come 
 Stand up and plant your feet 
 Listen I'm letting off steam 
 Now throw your hands in the air 
 Let loose I don't fuckin' care 
 Rattlehead 
 A dose of metal you need 
 To bang your head till you bleed 
 Oh, it's time for snapping some neck 
 Slashing, thrashing to Megadeth 
 Rattlehead 
 You, your head, is pounding with pain 
 You shake loose by stuffing your brains 
 Winning, sinning, beginning, feeding, the needing for bleeding 
 Bashing, smashing, crashing, fraying, annihilating you 
 There's someone back in the shadows 
 You feel though you can't see his eyes 
 He'll bash your head if you cross him 
 Ain't quite your average guy 
 Don't wear no leather to fittin' 
 Don't wear no spike to be cool 
 Don't want no woman beside him 
 Just make it fast, loud and rude 
 Rattlehead 
 Rattlehead, oh 
 Rattle your god damn head"
188,Megadeth,metal,Killing Is My Business...And Business Is Good!,"I am a sniper Always hit the mark 
 Paid assassin Working after dark 
 Looking through the night Using infra-red 
 My target on you Aimed at your head 
 $10.000 up front $10.000 when I'm through 
 And I know just what to do And ya know I'll do it too 
 Then I'm coming back for you Back for you 
 I do the ""getting rid of"" 
 Don't tell me why 
 Don't need to hear the truth 
 Don't need the lies 
 Now pay me quickly 
 And now we're through 
 It brings me great pleasure 
 To say my next job is you 
 Don't you know that 
 Killing is my business 
 And business is good 
 You'd better believe it"
189,Megadeth,metal,Take No Prisioners,"Got on chance, infiltrate them 
 Get it right, terminate them 
 The Panzers will, permeate them 
 Break their pride, denigrate them 
 And their people, retrograde them 
 Typhus, deteriorate them 
 Epidemic, devastate them 
 Take no prisoners, cremate them 
 Going to war, give 'em hell 
 D-Day, next stop Normandie 
 Beginning of the end 
 WE know how to and sure as shit we'll win 
 War is peace sure man 
 A retreat for the damned 
 A playground for the demented 
 A haven for those who walk this world 
 Bereft of heart and soul 
 Love and war they say all is fair 
 Take his life 
 But won't take his hair 
 Your body has parts your 
 Country can spare 
 By the way son here's 
 Your wheelchair 
 He once had to be all he could be 
 Now he's nothing for no one nowhere to see 
 Funny thing, he's like you and me 
 It's a funny thing, a funny thing 
 Tears streak his solemn stare 
 Abandoned for wreckage nobody cares 
 No one knew what would happen there 
 No one spoke no one even dared 
 Don't ask what you can do for you country 
 Ask what your country can do for you 
 Take no prisoners, take no shit"
