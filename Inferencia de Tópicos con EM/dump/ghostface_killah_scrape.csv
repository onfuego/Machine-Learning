 Me and you. I put trademarks around your fuckin' eye!)

 (Yeah, no doubt, no doubt, this Wally champ cat. Yeah, it's on this one) 
 Raekwon: 
 Yo, Gambino niggas who swipe theirs 
 Deluxe rap cavaliers 
 Midgets who steal beers, give 'em theirs 
 Chorus: Raekwon 
 Sit back jollyin' 
 My team be gamin' like three card Rolly an' 
 Drug Somalians pollyin' 
 Verse One: Raekwon 
 Many raps they crochetin' 
 Ay yo Iron, these niggas portrayin' 
 But haven't been payin' 
 For real, slide on these niggas like flesh fear 
 Caesar fade style, usually tough grenade 
 Throw a blade, fuck gettin' laid 
 Guzzle this shit like Gatorade 
 Big-dick Wallies have never half-suede 
 Connectin' with the hot style is done 
 Light up a chalis 
 I run with nuttin' but the wildest, foulest 
 Come on now, long-dick style 
 Niggas on the hit out, ay yo Iron bite my shit out 
 Eventually, bust a rap gun mentally 
 Been doin' this century kid, just meant to be 
 Get on your knees and bless me with a gem in the Caribbean 
 Skiin' off by P.M. 
 Snatch Canadian cream with Scandinavians 
 Fellatium style, play it like thirty-two Arabians 
 The greatest lesson is don't owe, you might get stole on 
 When I go bury me wit Valow on 
 (They come to me, and understand, just let me get mines first. Then after I 
 Get mines, y'all can do what y'all wanna do. Fuck 'em up bad) 
 Verse Two: Ghostface 
 'Sho 'nuff, hit the bank and thrust 
 Cool Nauticas Jamie Summer got trained on the tour bus 
 We upgrade, swallow raw eggs, read the label 
 Hittin' white-label, left the Winnebago unstable 
 Smooth sailin', walked in, my earth started kneelin' 
 Started stealin', I'm too ill, see we're bellin' at the parlay 
 Kicked up, mack, max motion 
 Michael Bolton magazine call, I'm too potent 
 Louisville mix pain kill rap, Fuck benadryl 
 The violin in 'Knowledge God' sounded ill 
 Tremendously obnoxious, no blotches 
 My telephone watch'll leave bartenders topless 
 Dead on the prosecutor, smacked a juror 
 Me and my girl'll run like Luke and Laura 
 We sit back on Malayan islands 
 Sippin' mix drinks out of boat coconut bowls, we whylin' 
 (Break) Raekwon: 
 Sit back jollyin', Uh huh, Uh huh 
 Uh huh, Uh huh, Sit back jollyin' 
 Uh huh, Uh huh, Uh huh, Uh huh 
 Sit back 
 Verse Three: Cappadonna 
 Deep meditation sound orientated, war the blizzard 
 Rap para-medical the wizard 
 Cappadonna, never caterin' to none 
 My microphone and three verse weigh a ton of slaughter 
 You oughta five thousand back across the water 
 My laboratory story keep me flowin' with the glory 
 Acapella or deep dirty instrumental 
 I could blow the sky like the stormy wind blew 
 One gallon of whylin', Park Hill profilin' 
 I cut your face up rough fifty sure while you're smilin' 
 For violatin' my position, 
 I leave you smoked like a crackhead on a mission 
 Two tokes of mic dope, one stroke of elegance 
 Rated like the movie graphic told intelligence 
 Person to person, it'd be hard for you to take a trophy 
 You better off to get somebody out to try to smoke me 
 'Cause I'm P-L-O T-K-O every day 
 Dancehall General, Party Fanatic Colonel 
 Cappadonna son'a old school just go infernal 
 Veteran for rappin' with the new set of rule of hard rappin' 
 Ninety-six jive, I keep the live crowd clappin' 
 When I bow, all praises due to Staten Isle 
 I spark the mic and Shaolin spark the methtical 
 Every evenin', I have a by myself meetin' 
 Thinkin' who's gonna be the next to catch a beatin' 
 From my mental slangin', bitchin' rap twist the point of warfare 
 I brutalize, all competition catch ill hair 
 Chance him, that's what they said, threw up a ransom 
 I jacked it, stripped the beat naked and packed it 
 Gimme my rewards 
 (The way I, the way I wanna get 'em. I want 'em gotten. I want 'em layin' 
 Out. I want 'em gotten. 'Cause niggas need to be gotten. He need to be 
 Taken off of here. That's right.)"

 That was the best fuckin' I ever had.

 [Ghostface]: No shit. 
 Shit that's my old man, shit!

 (Ghostface) 
 Yo bitch I fucked your friend, yeah you stank hoe 
 I seen her on the elevator, honey grabbed my Kangol 
 She put me on to mega-shit, bout to slap the bitch 
 She shot crazy verbal, I leaned back like I'm rich 
 It took place late night on February 17th 
 Hands flooded like ink, my face on her magazine 
 Just got back from Honolulu, pockets stackin boucoup cash 
 Girlfriend sipped the Yoo-hoo and laughed, yo 
 While I was on tour, whore, you went to work 
 Quick fast, had a nigga dick in the dirt 
 You couldn't wait just to kidnap the bait of my sperm 
 Where's you at, hoe? 'Pinky house, she put in my perm' 
 That's all you ever said to me, thought that could hold me 
 Remember when I long-dicked you and broke your ovary? 
 You crab bitch, chickenhead hoe, eatin' heroes 
 I'm the first nigga that had you watchin flicks by DeNiro 
 You gained crazy points, baby, just bein with God 
 Taught you how to eat the right foods, fast, and don't eat lard 
 I gave you earth lessons, I came to you as a blessin 
 You didn't do the knowledge what the God was manifestin 
 You sneaky fuck bitch, your ways and actions told it all 
 I fucked you while you was bleedin, held you down in malls 
 Sexually you worshipped my di-dick like a cross 
 I had you fiend out, broke out, for a month you fell off 
 You was my main shit, my peeps showed you love on the strength 
 You saw how I got down, the way I thought had you tranked 
 But you had to fuck this rasta-head ass nigga 
 I shoulda slapped ya but the Gods said chilllllllll 
 That's your wiz fault, god, handle that in the lab"" 
 I'm wonderin how many times your hot ass got stabbed 
 You dumb bitch, horny hot fuck from out the mountains 
 Your clientele is low hoe, catch you next show, bro 
 I got jerked, gave away my pussy, that shit hurt 
 It feel like somebody died or shot your old Earth 
 But fuck it, I fucked you on a chair with three legs 
 Broken tables, had you screamin while you was bitin on my cables 
 Whistlin to the washing machine, I threw it on spin 
 If your pussy dry, spit on my dick and put it in 
 My dick's the bomb baby, marvelous hot steak 
 Plus I'm conceited Starks make the biggest so-called rape 
 I'm God, cipher divine love my pussy real fine 
 That means clean the FDS smell with a shine 
 Word up, respect that hoe"

 Slow motion in cunt, takin' what we want 
 You know a kid asiatic, holdin' power like a Craftmatic 
 You like your fish fried or battered, that day he ratted 
 Check out the movies from Guyana, just eatin' in Atlanta 
 Makin' some pirate moves out of Savannah 
 Yeah, rock them niggas like jewelry 
 Arabics movin' blow like aerobics 
 That's when his nose itch, yeah 
 That means it's all in effect

 Continue to slam and mend you like a venue 
 Get all up in you, oh yeah your friend too, respect Wu 
 Yeah, keep the faggot niggas watery 
 Rhyme for rich niggas who supported me, shorty pussy extorted me 
 So it's a science now, RZA, cuttin' they pockets like scissors

 Splashin' ends in the glass Benz in Nevada 
 Flashin' gems, eight-and-a-half Tim state robber 
 All my life been on some foul shit besides kidnap a child shit 
 Get on some foul and proud shit 
 Cheatin' many Koreans bein' all that I can be an' 
 Put down on thirty keys an' get to fleein' 
 Light up a tree an'

3,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,260,"Cat I got to take him off of here, that's right 
 I got to take him off of here 
 Cause there's only one, and that's me 
 You understand? for all that fighting, you understand 
 That sucka think he good, that sucka think he can whoop me 
 And I know he can't whoop me, i... 
 Ay boy, the nigga whole style is chump 
 You understand? 
 Let me get mines first 
 Then after I get mines, you can do what you want to do... 
 (Ghostface) 
 Yeah, scandalous 
 Yeah miraculous, the arsonists 
 Yo, kicked down the door on the spot, 260 
 2l, I heard they had o's for sale 
 I heard the same shit, money drive a burgundy whip 
 Keep it low, faded licenses plates and great plate 
 Where's the cat from, think he's from new jerusalem 
 Pretty rick did his thing for him, but he was usin' him 
 Power sun, jungle, physical, you know the god 
 He go with tim, the one who called lover of god 
 While equality sell, I know the master law now 
 It's time to get the God jewel and blow like mines 
 But on the iow I heard he got born original sin 
 Back in a drive-through kentucky fried shot up his ac 
 We got to get him dunn, aliens is snatchin our bread 
 U.f.o.'s movin in with bigger plans than fed, yo 
 Knock on daddy-o's door get the scope 
 He's not home, he took ishmael to park slope 
 There go the the dreads yo, swindle two bags of that stuff 
 That get you crashed out had you laid out like bums 
 Peace keana, what's up with your girlfriend wanda 
 She drive a green honda, with legs like jane fonda 
 I just left her, she took rashean to pathmark then 
 Jetted to canal to get her man some cloth 
 She said be back in ninety minutes, ghostface God forbid 
 She say, peace to w, who's watchin the kids? 
 (Raekwon) 
 Two hours later, scheamin like deniro in casino 
 Son better have more coke than al pacino 
 Keana ain't tellin' no lies, last year she did a sting and a half 
 And tymeek bought her a aircraft 
 But anyway, yo, daddy-o home, we need the shotties nidow 
 When we get back, throw you a bit out 
 Later that night, stay mesmerized yo 
 Go get the green 5, meet you on the corner of marriot 
 You ready, you got the e&j and the machete? 
 We goin' upstairs, I hope one nigga is empty 
 We walked in, both of us, looked like terrorists 
 Masks on, second floor, dunn yo, I handle this 
 Kick in the crib, the whole shit looked graphical 
 Natural, fuckin' a white bitch, actual 
 Fiends chanting, ""do your thing chef, handle it"" 
 I shot him in the neck, it ricocheted and hit carolyn 
 Ran to the back analyzin, much disguisin 
 Surprise we comin' and their eyes were tranquilized 
 And buggin, throwin' her twin cousins at his nugget, fuck it 
 Meet shottie waddy slug body hobby 
 Where the drugs, where the ounces you be bouncin' 
 Fake cats announcin on the block, you loungin 
 Where the blow at, I ain't got shit, stop frontin 
 (Yo chef, throw the joint in his mouth, money'll start stuntin 
 Bitch, show that bit, before I push your wig back 
 Chef stop wavin that, show him where the paper at) 
 Come here valerie, you know the God he need a salary 
 Put down the pipe here's two tickets to a coke gallery 
 It's in the kitchen in the ceiling 
 (Baby girl kept squealing 
 Only found a white block of cheese from new zealand 
 Oh shit! yo, yo where that shit at yo? 
 Yo chef, where that shit? what? what? aiyyo...)"

 Intro: [from the motion picture ""The Usual Suspects""] 
 There's no coke! 
 What? 
 You heard me you dumb fuck, there's no coke! 
 What the fuck do you mean, there's no coke? 
 I've been up and down this ship. I've been in every fuckin' room! 
 There's gotta be coke! 
 There is nothing! NOTHING! 
 Huh, uh, uh, help please! 
 Huh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, help me! *gunshot* 
 Intro Two: Master Killer 
 It's assassi, it's assination day, I stalk... 
 It's assassination, I sta... 
 It's assassination day... 
 It's assassination day, I 
 Verse One: Inspector Deck 
 Ryzarector, Madman, uh, uh, yo, uh 
 I move through the third world, my third eye's the guiding light 
 Invite the fight, we all die tonight 
 The life I lived, a 25 to life bid 
 Parole reneged, I stroll the globe fugitive 
 CREAM is short, C-cypher power stalk plus the fiend talk 
 Three G's accost in Supreme Court 
 White lies and blackmail land me back in jail 
 We're all for sale, a stolen gold but it fail 
 Stranded on the front line, I shine to the dumb and blind 
 It comes time I take back what was once mine 
 Crunch time in the first quarter, from the worst slaughter 
 Devil's poisonin the birth water 
 The earth daughter rest her head on my chest 
 Through the struggle we cuddle under half-moon crest 
 While the press plant fear and exploit the gun blastin 
 Central broadcasting is shackling, nerves are unfastened, shhhh 
 Trapped in deep-water gaspin 
 I Clash With the Titans from my half on the action 
 Verse Two: RZA 
 I stop producers careers, the weak spot was their ears 
 Scorpion darts hits their mark, pierce their heart with silver spears 
 You're bewildered, my unsaturated, low filtered 
 Devils still peeled it still they're living built tilted 
 MC's upon their axis, their body has a tactic 
 Lactic acid, desert drop cactus, practice 
 You can never master, it's invincible, Wu-Tang indispensabe 
 One nation under God, indivisible 
 With liberty and justice, the mike is in my clutches 
 Thugs who bring ruckus, leave in crutches 
 Unforgiveable snakes face the double-edged swords starts to swivel 
 Decapitates the head, makes the projects, more livable 
 Interchangable, caution flameable 
 My chamber is ninety-nine plus one unnameable, angles 
 And strangles, microphone cords start to dangle 
 Silent as the gases that pass throughout your anal 
 Retrieve through your doors 
 Seep out like sweat through the pores 
 Destroy your internal organs with the biological warfare 
 Verse Three: Raekwon 
 (Assassination day) 
 First of all, before we move on, this shit is like a Yukon 
 Don, spread it out like Grey Poupon 
 Splurgin, mergin in the suburbs, using this just like an adverb 
 Action word, flowing like a blackbird 
 God came in, aimin like Terry Bradshaw 
 He hit the crash bar, stay relaxed God, his shit is smashed Pah 
 You handle this just like algebra, UFO spot 'em like Galaga 
 Hold on like bullet-proof Acuras 
 You so fly, yeah right, you want to get me high 
 Yo Bobby, you hear how I'm shootin it like they blew top snow 
 You won't play me like your lady 
 Pay me three-eighty spit it at you like a baby 
 Final destination Haiti 
 Verse Four: Master Killer 
 War is extremely serious and it saddens me 
 To have to take tings to deadly measures 
 And have you measured and shot for no pay 
 It's assassination day I stalk my enemy like prey 
 Tranked by deceptional sounds that deceives 
 And lures MC's to the lair 
 With a mic-like bait, then awaits to be bitten by greed 
 Temptation tempts my victim to proceed 
 Forward, ignorance wouldn't allow retreat 
 You'd rather pursue DEATH than admit defeat 
 Now who's best to describe for what I specialize in 
 Murdereous rhymin, constantly in climbin 
 My mind spits with an enormous kickback 
 Your brain didn't absorb the impact 
 Disorderly conduct from the crowd is the feedback... 
 It's assassination day, I 
 It's assassination day 
 It's assassination day 
 It's assassination day, I stalk my enemy 
 It's assassination day, I stalk my enemy"
5,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,Poisonous Darts,"* Also known as Water Technique 
 ""Let's see you try the water technique! Hai! Ha, ha! 
 (Sounds of fists and a whoosh of air followed by a punch) 
 The sky is high, the cloud is low 
 But my water technique is hard to think 
 That the earth, can absorb water, hai! Hai!"" 
 Yeah... word up... gotta zip my coat 
 Yeah... 
 ""The sky is high, the cloud is low"" (fuck him) 
 ""But my water technique is hard to think"" (yeah, check the live shit) 
 ""That the earth, can absorb water, hai! Hai!"" (uh) 
 Verse One: Ghostface 
 What the fuck I got the moonshine, word to God let's get it on 
 Clap your heels two times, grab the magic wand 
 Nameless, these stonewashed cats leave him brainless 
 Some are out of this world, stranded on Uranus 
 With coke and a dollar bill stems and crack capsules 
 Take a blast fool boobie trap up crews it's natural 
 Like soy bean, burn like a laser beam 
 My vaccine I shoot it firm and it connects like sideburns 
 The segment, rare fragment comes together 
 Like magnets, attract heads capture like Dragnet 
 Going through mad phases, of all ages 
 Killa Beez locked the fuck up behind cages 
 The Genovese swallow this line and caught a freeze 
 Press call ID for me to quote more degrees 
 The fortune teller Tucker sleeping gas umbrella 
 A war where they're gunning in the back of Armanbella 
 Now who, don't believe that cash must rule 
 I don't eat beef, I slap blood out of Purdue 
 Keep a Wallace mic, mics on strike the session 
 It's over, I file this and glow like fluorescent 
 *Raekwon sings some shit over Water Technique samples* 
 Verse Two: Ghostface Killah 
 Yo yo, methods of blow like snow constant cashflow 
 Rocking a Shaft afro, Tony got mad glow 
 With hoes, mega powder dripping from they nose 
 Fucking Jet magazine bitches with, wild pussy pose 
 Send them for the whole night, daily venom horror snake bites 
 Only Built 4 Cuban Link kings who shoot dice 
 Holding money that's convertible, beds with feathered bags 
 With the mongoose your man's got two seeds down in Baghdad 
 You onion head niggaz spread out and parley 
 Yo Rae these itch days get crashed with ash trays 
 I pull stings like, guitar strings down in Spain 
 I'm so hyped Jakes label God ""crack cocaine"" 
 Why Equality Self God, yeah yeah you know it kid 
 Ricki fucked up, and G-Pac, blow his wig 
 He's rocking Wu Wear, the latest in fleece uniform 
 He's a newborn, look at money swearing like he's on 
 But anyway back to furry Kangols Jamaican Wallabees 
 My back is on the wall, bombing devils with trick-knowledgy 
 My heart is cold like Russia, got jerked at The Source awards 
 Next year two hundred niggaz coming with swords!"

 Intro: Method Man 
 It's on... 
 (Where your sparkle at kid) 
 Ryzarector 
 Break: Raekwon the Chef 
 Yes the shit is raw, comin' at your door 
 Start to scream out loud, Wu-Tang's back for more 
 Yes the hour's four, I told you before 
 Prepare for mic fights (and plus the cold war) 
 Verse One: U-God 
 This rhyme you digest through the RZA console 
 Ask why I slam, non-diagram pole 
 Raekwon dropped the bomb, Hunchback, Notre Dame 
 Golden Arms is bronze, Buddha palm hit Qu'ran 
 It blows extreme, mean stream be the theme 
 Supreme team, America's Cream Team, redeemed 
 Vidal Sassoon, chrome tones hear the moans of Al Capone 
 Gun POW to the dome 
 And split the bone, wig blown off the ledge 
 By the alleged, full-fledged, sledge RZA edge 
 One dose of my feroc (ious) hand held trigger cuts 
 Acapella spitting shell paralysed when you get touched 
 And critical, mic cords, hanging like umbilical 
 Cords, dope swords, five star general 
 Raw be the quote rap style sore throat 
 Through the fully operational, hand held tote 
 Break: (first two lines) 
 Verse Two: Ghostface Killer 
 More than thousand times one, snatch up, my styles get done 
 I hold a title, enhanced how my belt was won, check it 
 Slick majestic, broke mics are left infected 
 Germs start to spread through your crew, drew like an epic 
 You asked for it, shot up the jams like syringes 
 My technique alone blows doors straight off the hinges 
 Masked Avenger, I appear to blow your ear like wind 
 With a freestyle, sharper than the Indian spear 
 So sit back and let the king explore 
 Describe me, the kid's nice and he holds swords 
 And his name, black attack's the nerve like migraines 
 With more games than beggars on trains, livid sharp pains 
 Poisonous Rebel like Deck, you can't destroy this 
 You get ambushed, skate, try to avoid this 
 Side effects of, hot raps and hot tracks 
 A duffel bag full of guns son, dipped in black 
 My culture, glides and attacks like a vulture 
 Ghostface and Madison Square is on your poster 
 Break 
 Verse Three: Masta Killa 
 Be on the lookout for this mass murderous suspect 
 That throws more body bags than apartments in projects 
 And as far as the coroners know 
 The autopsy shows, it was a Shaolin blow 
 Put on by my family brought to the academy 
 Of the Wu and learned how to 
 Fuck up your anatomy, steadily, calm and deadly 
 Spatter-head lyrics I lick through your transmit 
 MC's submit to the will as I kill your 
 Juvenile freestyle, civilize the mental 
 Devils worship this like an icon 
 They're hugging mics with the grips of a python 
 Break 
 Verse Four: Cappadonna (Cappachino) 
 You heard of the rasp before but kept waiting 
 For the sun of song, I keep dancehalls strong 
 Beats never worthy of my cause, I prolong 
 Extravaganza, time sits still 
 No propaganda, be wary of the skill 
 As I bring forth the music, make love to your eardrum 
 Dedicated to rap niggaz, beware of the fearsome 
 Lebanon Don, Malcolm X beat threat 
 CD massacre, murder to cassette 
 I blow the shop up, you ain't seen nothing yet 
 One man ran, trying to get away from it 
 Put your bifocal on, watch me I cometh 
 Into your chamber like Freddy enter dreams 
 Discombumberate your technique and your scheme 
 Four course applause, like a black dat to dat 
 You're stuck on stupid like I'm stuck on the map 
 Nowhere to go except next show bro 
 Entertaining motherfuckers can't stop O 
 In battling, you don't want me to start tattling 
 All upon the stage because y'all snakes keep rattling 
 Bitch, you ain't got nothing on the rich 
 Every other day my whole dress code switch 
 So just in case you want to clock me like Sherry 
 All y'all crab bitches ain't got to worry 
 Can't get a nigga like Don dime a dozen 
 Even if I'm smoked out I can't be scoped out 
 I'm too ill, I represent Park Hill 
 See my face on the twenty dollar bill 
 Cash it in, and get ten dollars back 
 The fat LP with Cappaccino on the wax 
 Pass it in your think, put valve up to twelve 
 Put all the other LP's back on the shelf 
 And smoke a blunt, and dial 9-1-7 
 1-6-0-4-9-3-11 
 And you can long dick hip-hop affection 
 I damage any MC who step in my direction 
 I'm Staten Island's best son fuck what you heard 
 Niggaz still talking that shit is absurd 
 My repertoire is U.S.S.R. 
 P.L.O. style got blown out the car 
 And run over, by the Method Man Jeep 
 Divine can't define my style is so deep 
 Like pussy, my low cut fade stay bushy 
 Like a porcupine, I part backs like a spine 
 Cut you like a blunt and reconstruct your design 
 I know you want to diss me, but I can read your mind 
 'Cause you ""weak in the knees"" like SWV 
 Trying to get a title like Wu Killa Bee 
 Kid change your habit, you know I'm friends with the Abbot 
 Me and RZA riding name printed in the tablet 
 Under vets, we paid our debts for mad years 
 Hibernate the sound, and now we out like beers 
 And blunt power, born physically power speaking 
 The truth in the song be the pro-black teaching"

 You know the party screams and shouts 
 Cause you... DAMN! Aw, TC that was the bomb...

 Get all my peoples, get all my peoples headphones

 Blend wine, who want to win mine 
 Shorty get a ten-round for floatin

 Your criminal pen pal kidnapped Loud, jetted the 
 Moseying, posing for them niggaz up in Poland 
 Rollin' wax style museum, G 'em 
 Them richest niggaz bless this like Russian cut VVS's 
 Slide the hatchback, black were finessing this 
 Them niggaz over there know, Gazelle goggles 
 And them Lottos, 88 style, throwing bottles (bottles) 
 Scenario rap, rap imperial, material (uh, yo yo, yo, yo) 
 Murdering cats is like that real 
 Verse Two: Ghostface 
 Yo come do me something word to Michelob peep the Land Rov' 
 Sleeper hold club faggots lay your dome on a stove 
 It's like space kid, the whole world is pitch black, granola rap 
 Dough got smaller famous team, walked up in Photomat 
 Black down, numerous rounds, boots is brown 
 Getaway driver, this white bitch from out of town 
 We love horse races shaking Jakes and high-speed chases 
 Porno stations, drinking violations, God relations 
 90 minute Maxwell tapes, instrumental breaks 
 Banging earaches, lay my verse down in two takes 
 The speaker pops, the Winchester rifle's in the kitchen 
 Murder the DJ's eyes twitching, woofer hissing 
 Interlude: Raekwon 
 Yo, he's strong arming, manipulating niggaz, scraping niggaz 
 Taking play from niggaz, hate faking niggaz, yo you hear me? 
 The whole shit's like wrestling 
 What you dare me? Back the fuck up kid, we flexing 
 Verse Three: Method Man 
 This rap shit bust yo' gums, and leave you stunned 
 Pull your plug, now you can't function 
 There's no total or sum to this equation, you frozen 
 Many may come but few are chosen 
 Pretty niggaz want to play the war posing 
 When the ruckus come, they be the first to get their shine stolen 
 Do or die, it be I, Meta-physical Man 
 Holding court from my Wu, indivisible Clan 
 I see your thoughts and your hand reaching 
 It's getting deep in this mud 
 Cats heat seeking, for one blood 
 Nameless thugs with aimless slugs, shooting at these stank bitches 
 Less he gon' bring this above, I make switches 
 From the lamp I grant three wishes 
 Johnny be parleying, I Blaze britches, then I roll 
 One hundred percent mind, one hundred percent body 
 One hundred percent soul, individual 
 Assholes tend to run 
 From this PLO extortion to the one 
 The next chamber, you fucking with the star spangler 
 To the dawn's early light with this head-banger 
 Boogie, represent this shit fully 
 Like I'm constantly at war with the town bully 
 Who want that pressure, about to get smacked silly 
 Like a fat bitch in Spandex, 'Free Willy'! 
 We on some milli, check the joint, engine number nine 
 Niggaz wasting time worrying about me and mine 
 Get your own shit"

 There's one thing I'm sure of, it's that drugs destroy your mind. And destroy 
 Your home. In the end it'll only lead our country into ruin)... 
 Ghostface killah- 
 We eat fish, tossed salads and make rap ballads 
 The biochemical slang lord'll throw the arrows in the dope fiend 
 Vocal chords switch laser beams my triple sevens 
 Broke the slot machines out in Queens, Grey Poupon is rebel on rap 
 Smack on, swing like batons, most want niggas smoked like Hillshire Farms 
 Check the gun we sew, underneath my shoe lies the tap 
 That attract bow-legged bitches with wide horse gaps 
 In steel mills iron he'll smoke the blow on Duns 
 You run heroins, Primatene Mist is afraid of my lungs 
 Turn my channel, it'll blow your whole bench off the panel 
 Like 80 Roman candles that backfired then slammed you 
 Every day is like a video shoot, check this shit 
 I take you back to Playboy, stash guns and whips 
 Picture afro, big Shish Kabobs and daishikis 
 1000 civil marched blazed their fists in early sixties 
 Cappadonna- 
 Now check this one, you must have been stupid to miss this one 
 'Donna shogunning flip a ton of fashion 
 Destination be the cash when I step past one 
 Don't make me blast one, I'm cold like Eskimo flow 
 Cappadonna stay chilling take shots of penicillin 
 Clean out and let the steam out, she fiend to blow out 
 But I'm equipped with mad white, Morris The Rap got nine lives 
 I'll take a few hundred-thousand dollar dives 
 And then I still never go down until the last round I shine, 
 When RZA do his thing motherfucker, I'ma do mine 
 Raekwon- 
 Now, where I come from cats be carrying Marrying drug money 
 Fuck up your wife, get four to life, claim we handling 
 Midtown niggers scrambling, moving examine the fly shit 
 Plus quick to buy shit Chef, yeah, you know the whole gods 
 Asterisk, Fidel Castro suits plus depositing cash rule big time 
 Play it like Canadian wine, RZA 's the rhyme now, the sacredness of 
 One's true mind Now let's get colourful like money green 
 High roller coaster, Sosa, million dollar nigger roaster 
 Yeah, GOD, be having my whole steez laced 
 Now let's wrap our tapes, connect dots 
 Aim Glocks train style, Figaro fly jewel 
 Tri-color Cubans swerving we'll pow with Germans in Suburbans 
 24 niggas with vests's on, my own restaurant 
 Dons sending my sons membership forms 
 They still getting this paper scraper 
 Fake haters from Jamaica, wizards be passing like Lakers 
 And if you coming from Lex, Lewis, Rich Liberace 
 Foetus style and block your goals like hockey..."

 Verse One: Raekwon the Chef 
 Yo, what's the deal Goldielochs? 
 Ain't butting I'm just hibernating love that watch 
 Pour me some Scotch and cold Courvesoir out 
 No doubt, have a chair Boo let's get to prolly in 
 Who you wit? Me and Molly and some trick from Yugoslavia 
 What fabric is that? It's only woolen Rayon 
 Lipstick crayon fly, Vere on ice spray on 
 I'm getting tipsy, I hope she read cocks like a gypsy 
 And transport bricks steal in many fifties 
 Fuck negotiating is you wit me is you waiting 
 Sweet as carrot cake, faking plus you don't eat turkey bacon 
 I don't get down like that, I don't get down neither 
 Cuban Linx skeezer, why you acting like a rap teaser

 She this book cover lady that be blowing up the spot 
 While my heart was racing, like the hands on the clock 
 I step live I think she see me putting out the pot 
 Peace Dot, I'm so happy to see you at the rendezvous 
 How's life today your hands are softer than Camay 
 Too your hairdo way more class than Halle Berry 
 Caught visions of me and you riding on the ferry 
 Plus your daughter Kiki talk to my man Merry 
 I order me a Sex on the Beach with the cherry 
 I order her a Vermidi on ice, sounds nice 
 She elegant, pretty eyes, glasses, intelligent 
 Whispered in my ear that she's celibate 
 Whispered back to her ear we don't have to go there 
 As I grab the hand set her politely in the chair 
 As we stopped to stare at one another 
 Black sister, the brother 
 I'm thinking all the time how she could be my lover 
 Chorus: Teddy Pendergrass 
 Just another helpless 
 Fool in love is what I am 
 Love was never born to say, goodbye 
 Love was never born to say, goodbye 
 Just another helpless 
 Fool in love is what I... 
 Verse Three: Ghostface Killah 
 What's happening brown sugar? Say you look so good today 
 Ankle bracelet rapt around your leg 
 Here have a seat, complementary drinks is on me 
 Bartender Chevalier châteaux at table three 
 Luxurious rings, eyes sparkling 
 What's your name sugar? Juanita Cash Hawkins 
 Your complexion gives a reflection of 
 Sometime a black woman just need to be loved 
 Quiet and shy, baby girl my gift got you high 
 Made you wanna hit me with the keys to that file 
 Just joking baby, I have a sharp sense of humour 
 Wish I would of bumped into your frame a lot sooner 
 What's your physical degree, thirty one, thirty three 
 Half Hawaiian with a slight touch of Chinese 
 Seen you working at a law firm, on Fifth Avenue 
 Three blocks from the Gucci spot is where I trapped you 
 Yo, I'm all into older woman, who's happy living 
 Love kids and, keep all up and this in the crib and 
 Not afraid to doubt need a God on your side 
 We holding hands till death do us apart and then we slide 
 Earring in the left side of your nose love my combo 
 Should have left wiz a thousand times maybe tonight though 
 But you sexy motherfucker damn what's the recipe? 
 You make a nigga wanna GOD DAMN 
 Can you cook darling, at the stove you're revolving 
 Bake macaroni, turkey wings, a nigga starving 
 Here take my number let me pull the chair from under 
 I had fun plus your backyard speak with thunder

 Just another helpless fool in love is what I am (repeat to fade)"

 We are the G, O-D's 
 And we came to rock, the spot 
 Like Ironman Starks 
 They be the illest MC's, in the world today 
 Cappa, Raekwon and the R-Z-A 
 So listen to them clear, and put the box right near your ear 
 Light your blunts and down your beers 
 Cause you could never fuck with Wu-Tang Killer Beez... 
 (Raekwon the Chef) 
 Say peace to cats who rock mack knowledge knowledgists 
 Street astrologists, light up the mic God, knowledge this 
 Fly joints that carried your points, Corolla Motorola holder 
 Play it God, he pack over the shoulder 
 Chrome tanks, player like Yanks, check the franchise 
 Front on my guys, my enterprise splash many lives 
 Rapel all fakes like reflectors 
 He had sugar in his ear in his last crack career 
 We can can him, manhandle him, if you wanna 
 Run in his crib-o, get ditto, skate like a limo 
 And jet to the flyest estate, relate take a break 
 Break down an eighth and then wait drop it like Drake 
 Thugs they be booing and screwing, we canoeing 
 Claim they doing the same shit we doing, fuck your union 
 It's the same style, RZA trainable, jump the turnstile 
 On the alley tried to challenge God for the new vials 
 Especially that, aluminium bat in the act 
 Relax, lay back, sell a grenade a day, it pays black 
 The Mac-10 flex white cats like Windex 
 Index finger be sore, busting these fly scripts 
 The Wally kid count crazily grands with our plans 
 Laying with my bitches and my man's in Lex Lands 
 We losing them, jet to the stash and now Jerusalem 
 Abusing them, rocking his jewels like we using them 
 Low pro star, seven thick waves rock Polar 
 Roll with the Older God, build with the Son and the Star 
 All these MC's start realizing 
 That Ghost got that shit, that'll keep you vibing 
 The Wu is here to bring, you Shaolin's finest 
 But if your shields are weak, you better step behind us 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Mercury raps is roughed then God just shown like taps 
 Red and white Wally's that match, bend my baseball hat 
 Doing forever shit, like pissing out the window on turnpikes 
 Robbing niggaz for leathers, high swiping on dirt bikes 
 Voice be metal like Von Harper radio bubble 
 Murder sleep away camp, the fly lady champ 
 The arsonist, who burn with his pen regardless 
 Slaying all these earthlings and fake foreigners 
 In the Philippines, pick herbal beans, bubbling strings 
 Biochemical cream, we burn kerosene 
 The conviction of my tape is rape, wicked like Nixon 
 Long-heads inscriptions with three sixes in 
 Kiss the pyramid experiment with high explosive 
 I slapbox with Jesus, lick shots at Joseph 
 Zooming like binoculars, the rap blacksmith 
 Money's Rolex, with sparkles, Chef ragtop is spotless 
 I'm Iron Man no cheap cash metal I'm steel alloy 
 True identity hidden inside secret tabloids 
 Breathe oxygen both sides of my jaw carry oxes 
 The track hit like the bangers, in hundred watt boxes 
 Yo jostling these cats while Little J be dallying 
 Sip Irish Moss out of Widelians 
 (Cappadonna) 
 Give me the the fifty thou, small bills, my gold plate, my slang kills 
 My Benz spills, whattup Lils, murder one Dunn 
 Killer bee stung, guess who back home Son 
 My technique of slang camp won, third platoon soon 
 Crystal bottles, cages of boom, probably wardrobe 
 The Mad Hatter big dick style, beware goons 
 Smuggle balloons, lord of dooms, in fat pussy wombs 
 Let the Gods build, pull up the grill, check out the mad skills 
 Top secret technique, too hard for you to peep it and keep it, 
 Jiggy style of rap and watching knuckle slang, sweep it 
 Out of order ape recorder can't record my slaughter 
 Spoil the rotten Don is too good to be forgotten 
 High top notch, borderline rhymes is hand cocked 
 '96, my ill sound clash is still hot, get yourself shot"

 (Yo yo guzzling forties, let's get it on fella, no doubt) 
 The wiley Wu-Tang comes back, Iron Man strikes back 
 (Lou Diamonds, Tony Starks) Raid your whole empire 
 No doubt! 
 Verse One: Raekwon the Chef, AKA Lou Diamonds 
 Rich man, poor man, read the headlines 
 Nigga getting murdered for spot and bigger dimes 
 Jobs and drug wars, living by gun law 
 Jail cats come home and want to take yours 
 As the young one, growing up broke me and my people 
 As the self, huh, I guess we all in the same boat 
 Think it, plus drinking that 90-proof 
 Playing on the roof saying we need a next man to shoot... 
 (Sometimes I feel, like a motherless child...) 
 Verse Two: Ghostface Killer, AKA Tony Starks 
 Yo, I know a rich kid, who got hit for three bricks 
 Showing off his 850 plus, what a nice whip 
 Young blood guzzling forties hussled in a rain 
 Old Earth, shooting dope in her veins 
 He never had it all, the kid loved basketball 
 Had a favourite song, ""I Miss You"" written by Aaron Hall 
 Now back to the original neighbourhood criminals 
 Clocking dollars, by the hour like his digital 
 Styrofoam silencers, he rolled around with the 
 Wildest niggaz peeling caps known as the Islanders 
 From Staten, where crazy clips be clapping 
 Slept in his principal spreads, threads made of satin 
 Labelled as the cow he had crazy beef 
 Seen him at the flicks, he pulled out on Duke, Hez and Latief 
 But he fucked up, he should of kept it real and went for kill 
 'Cause if he don't, these niggaz with black barrels will 
 But, shit will never calm down, one day downtown 
 He dropped an ounce off money had slept like a nightgown 
 He rolled up in the Albee Square, relax like he lived in there 
 Two kids was beaming him, them niggaz from the movie theatre 
 One had all Guess on, looking like he had a vest on 
 The other felly pell tucked with a firearm 
 Moving slow, baseball hats, crazy down low 
 Word life God, this bull kag nigga gotta go 
 Oh shit! Bookhead, just bought a 5, G headed King Tudpea 
 About the size of Little Maurice 
 We got to get up baby, no cousin, count to ten 
 I'm running in my first instance is to return em, the time is now 
 Warfare and pull delf 
 Remember me, the nigga from the UA and you pulled out 
 Don't move don't even flinch 
 Fix 'em up, drop the head, don't want to get blood in the tut 
 He burped, I shot him, bitch screamed out I'm robbing him 
 Had to hit him ten more times make sure I got him 
 Told the owner lay on the floor, shake the comedy 
 Randy came out whacked out with a half a shotty 
 I laughed, grab the King Tut head and the cash 
 Then he shot my man in the ass and broke mega glass 
 Damn, had to go out with a blast 
 I shot my way up out of the Albee fast 
 (Sometimes I feel, like a motherless child) 
 Oh shit, what the fuck? 
 This shit is horrible."

 Blow his Back out, make his shoes work

 Aye Yo, this shit be off the knock it rock 
 Whatever cock block it cat get blown, who own this 
 Street corner, foreigner hesitate to rock a Hummer 
 Navy Seal top runner, rhyme this summer 
 For real, marinating nigga's skating 
 Debating waiting, style flowinly relating 
 Fine line switch it on ya like Venetian blinds 
 The mission is mine, fabulous King I Divine 
 Titanium Hydro collado, Yo dunn dunn 
 Polly dis conjunction, Son what, slang doctor 
 Medicaid the kids pay it 
 Say if these niggas in affect dunn, stay rap related 
 Cassette rhymer, 5-G cosigner, line for liner 
 Poet designer, sharp like liners 
 Mic of the year award, fly gear award 
 Them niggas over there be analysing for one sword 
 Get bent, pay the rent, plus still we invent 
 Nuff shit to get your whole team crazily sent 
 Now all I need is a half gallon of weed 
 Proceed, to bust as Mike Ditka made three seeds 
 Then Max out like two Ack's inside the parking lot 
 Son bark a lot and get seen hit in that dark a lot 
 What now blow, clicking like a calico 
 Gold Maximilian, one love keep it real yo

 Yo, hit me for these Tommy Hill, ice rocking niggas 
 Peace, the summers mine, I blow the biggest 
 Back up off me, while I grab my dick and hold the Heini 
 Park the Blue 600, Wally kings is right behind me 
 Tackle clubs, never rock Lugz, I'm way above 
 These mic's is like golden gloves verses spark plug 
 It's like the pennant, Seminars the Play-off 
 Start the J off like Cochran got OJ off 
 The Specialist who eye balled the mistress necklace 
 Perpetuous, this curly head kid's treacherous 
 Leggo the Eggo, so we can dip dip dive the gleego 
 Throwing can-can, eat that plus this Instrumental 
 Awwww Shit say Stark-aligist, Starks-aligist 
 Fried fish halibut pull out the bull horn 
 And celebrate like Kunta was born 
 We elbowed our way inside loud and got on 
 I played the building, burn a branch and get filled in 
 Like Pilgrims G-ing Pepperidge Farms from out a million 
 Who wanna rhyme? who wanna challenge the swordsman? 
 That rock that fisherman hat like Gordon's 
 (U-God) 
 I hose down the place no shots to the face 
 Elite Special force no religion style faith 
 The melting pot boil gun shot drama soil 
 Gamble when I scramble handle hot pots of oil 
 Man handle brain killing erect my hidden 
 Streets may be potent put your 96 bid in 
 Vampire Curse disperse on each verse 
 Swim in black water, act slaughter through my earth 
 You're hit by my element Great Wall of China 
 Mountain Peak hold the globe like vagina 
 Measure on my mic stand, molecule and strand 
 Finger rolling rhythm ride the horse one hand 
 'GoldenEye', 'Spy vs. Spy', guilty of suspicion 
 Chess boxer, mic in dead body position 
 40 oz. Ciga-art, three verse invented 
 Divine universal black man representing 
 Similar the pure, rhyme blowing out the pore 
 Battery in the back, keep it charged for the raw 
 I'm bred type thorough, pistol lyro gun hero 
 Renaissance rebel shadow boxing your barrel 
 Fully woven Beethoven, hit you on a humble 
 Hard enough to hurt you, chastise my rap styles 
 Lock down, for this curfew"

 Max out in Spain and do business with the Jews 
 Never that, them never look angry out of synch 
 The imperial, industrial king got weight 
 Don't give a fuck like the poor part, we watch 'Heart To Heart' 
 They used to push me in shuffle cards 
 Now I'm writing books like Ebeneezer 
 The porno teaser saying words like Sheba 
 Educated rapper fouling the teaser 
 My team got rocks like Six Flags, plus the Wu lab 
 Cameras in nine bedrooms we own tags 
 Don't touch this crackling hot shit 
 I snap ya shoulder blade in half, laugh, and pop shit 
 Reader's Digest, passed my book to L. Ron Hubbard 
 Got bagged that the world government tried to dub it 
 But devils love it movie trap raps cover the tracks

 The greatest story ever told by me, precisely 
 Roman numeral IV plus three describe me 
 My son move like the toad get drunk speak in codes 
 Throw a fiend in the sleeper hold got beef with the cold 
 Met my comrade go half on this lamp down in Baghdad 
 Flipping like a mex tab get money like an Arab 
 The type niggas snapped six legs on the crab 
 Now, hush, who wanna do what, my click better bust

 Underprivileged, 
 Grew up in a Stapleton house village, 
 Where blood flood the water in the streets like oil spillage 
 When the water was flowing (Wu-Tang-Delphonics number one) 
 I spot a fifty-five borough 
 A nigga was still flowing voice was echoing 
 I rise high like an Opera's, Procter wouldn't Gamble 
 The sample, it shocked her 
 My ninjas run wilder than Shaka Zulu, some play peace like Donny the Guru 
 Others live to be wise and old like Desmond Dutcher 
 Undisputed champion, bell holders, shape and mould us 
 Soul Controller of the moon, I, solar and polar

 Three months man. 
 Watchu doin' in here anyway? You oughta be home with your mama. 
 How old are you boy? 
 Thirteen. 
 Thirteen? Damn, the bastards must be running outta niggaz to arrest. 
 Yeah, ooh yeah, this goes out 
 To all the families that went through the struggle 
 Yeah, from the heart 
 It was from the heart, everything was real 
 Yo, dwelling in the past, flashbacks when I was young 
 Whoever thought that I'd have a baby girl and three sons 
 I'm going through this difficult stage I it find hard to believe 
 Why my Old Earth had so many seeds 
 But she's her own woman and due to me I respect that 
 I saw life for what it's really worth and took a step back 
 Family ain't family no more, we used to play ball 
 Eggs after school, eat grits 'cause we was poor 
 Grab the pliers from the channel, fix the hanger on the TV 
 Rocking each others pants to school wasn't easy 
 We survived winters, snotty nosed with no coats 
 We kept it real, but the older brother still had jokes 
 Sadly, Daddy left me at the age of six 
 I didn't know nothing but my Mommy neatly packed his shit 
 She cried, and Grandma held the family down 
 I guess Mommy wasn't strong enough, she just went down 
 Check it, fifteen of us in a three bedroom apartment 
 Roaches everywhere, cousins and aunts was there 
 Four in the bed, two at the foot, two at the head 
 I didn't like to sleep with Jon-Jon, he peed in the bed 
 Seven o'clock, plucking roaches out the cereal box 
 Some shared the same spoon, watching Saturday cartoons 
 Sugar water was our thing, every meal was no thrill 
 In the summer, free lunch held us down like steel 
 And there was days I had to go to Tex house with a note 
 Stating, ""Gloria can I borrow some food I'm dead broke"" 
 So embarrassing I couldn't stand and knock on they door 
 My friends might be laughing, I spent stamps in stores 
 Mommy where's the toilet paper, use the newspaper 
 Look Ms. Rose gave us a couch, she's the neighbour 
 Things was deep, my whole youth was sharper than cleats 
 Two brothers with muscular dystrophy, it killed me 
 But I remember this, Moms would lick her fingertips 
 To wipe the cold out my eye before school with her spit 
 Case worker had her running back to face to face 
 I caught a case, housing tried to throw us out of our place 
 Sometimes I look up at the stars and analyse the sky 
 And ask myself was I meant to be here... why? 
 Yeah, yo 
 All that I got is you 
 And I'm so thankful I made it through 
 All that I got is you 
 And I'm so thankful I made it through 
 All that I got is you 
 And I'm so thankful I made it through 
 All that I got is you 
 And I'm so thankful I made it through 
 I sit and think about 
 All the times we did without, yeah 
 I always said I wouldn't cry 
 When I saw tears in your eyes 
 I understand that daddy's not here now 
 But some way or somehow, I will always be around, yeah 
 All things that I did from this to them 
 Oh, from drugs to being there 
 Being down and out and I love you always 
 Yeah, you say 
 You see the universe, which consists of the sun, moon and stars 
 And them planets, that exist in my space 
 Like man, woman and child 
 You understand? 
 We got to keep it real, and what reality 
 And reality will keep it real with us 
 I remember them good ol' days 
 Because see, that's the child I was 
 What made me the man I am today 
 See, 'cause if you forget where you come from, hehe 
 You're never gonna make it where you're goin', aheh 
 Because you lost the reality of yourself 
 So take one stroll through your mind 
 And see what you will find 
 And you'll see a hole universe all over again 
 And again and again and again and again 
 Hehehe, yeah hehehehe ahahehehe"

 Yo, yo these streets got me backed down how can I escape? 
 How can I survive without bubblin weight? 
 It's prepared for the stand off, once you hand off 
 That white rock, and then give birth to a knot 
 Your biggest dream was to rock your 850 and beam 
 You and the Gods buy a crib in the white part of Queens 
 But at the same time, niggaz on the block is ill 
 Some'll rock you to sleep, hap, for selling cross pills 
 Being watched all day like enemy's prey 
 Faces, you never seen before is in your hallway 
 Brothers you knew for years is mad pussy and scared 
 Back in the days U.F.O.'s couldn't walk up in here 
 It's time to motor, travel like a foul order 
 Clear my head, stay sober, the soul controller 
 The Force MD's 
 Oah, it's been a long, long 
 A long time coming

 Said I'm too, tired of livin'

 'Cause I don't know what's up there 
 In that great big ol' sky 
 Ghostface 
 Sink deep into the fog, big buffalo large 
 Taj Mahal just got banged, shanked for eighty dollars 
 It's hard to keep up, with these key-ons, that smoke dust 
 In the U.S. Mint they want to rock the place and call the rush 
 All these shameless niggaz armed with cherry-red Bally's 
 On the twenty-fifth, everybody rich is gettin' married 
 Killed for power beans, your brother own schools in Medina 
 Vaseline lips is cracked 'cause they all had dreams 
 They overdue, these Gods own a mosque in Peru 
 Tropical trees and weaves where they grew bamboo 
 Olympic minds quick flash like a leak on 
 A hundred shares short to own Nissan, watch 'em get they feast on 
 Royal blue lies inside the eyes of heaven 
 Curse the head, who speak foul and jinx number seven (seven) 
 Clear my head and stay sober, the soul controller...

 Go off in airports, biographies, prophecies 
 Watch me set it, real key-ons hold down the desert 
 And walk with a famous name like Supreme Magnetic 
 Carbon copy, I love my car, it's near choppy 
 Melachi off the funky pain with the wax poppy on instrumentals 
 Niggaz get lost like S.S. Minnows 
 Turned out like rentals, keep gold around the denim 
 The Force MD's 
 A change gon come 
 Yes it will 
 It's been a long, long 
 A long time coming 
 A change gon come 
 Woo, yes it will 
 Said I'm so 
 Tired of living 
 But I'm, but I'm afraid to die 
 'Cause I don't know what's up there 
 In that great, big ol sky 
 Oh my, oh my, oh my 
 It's been a long, long time 
 A long time coming 
 Change gonna come 
 Woo, yes it will 
 Outro Part Two: (from the motion picture ""Carlito's Way"") 
 Sorry boys, 
 All the stitches in the world can't sew me together again 
 Lay down, lay down 
 Gonna stretch me out in Fernandez funeral home on hun and ninth street 
 Always knew I'd make a stop there 
 But a lot later than a whole gang of people thought 
 Last of the Mohicans 
 Well, maybe not the last 
 Can't come with me on this trip, Loaf 
 Gettin' the shakes now 
 Last call for drinks 
 Bar's closin down 
 Sun's out 
 Where we goin' for breakfast? 
 Don't wanna go far 
 Rough night 
 Tired, baby 
 Tired... 
 Outro Part Three: (from the motion picture ""The Usual Suspects"") 
 Greatest trick the devil ever pulled 
 Was convincing the world he didn't exist 
 And like that, he's gone"

 [Ghf] Yeah, check it out y'all one two 
 We back up in this joint! What? 
 Check the fly shit... yeah 
 Don't black out on me 
 Verse One: Ghostface 
 Yo, black man watch out, she salt-water trout 
 Al Deuce dug her back out, inside the dugout 
 Heard the pussy was good, big niggaz fell victim 
 Mentally stripped 'em one God turned Christian 
 She know magic, soaking wet pussy on the mattress 
 Skin like Cleopatra's, the leading actress 
 She been fucking since we went to fourteen, look at Miss Thing 
 With a ponytail kept a jar of Vaseline 
 She's a big girl now, with a body that growl 
 Likewise murder trial, smile attract crowds 
 Most niggaz, would light the lord over this broad 
 Big niggaz in they drawers pose one knee on the floor 
 Little kids daydream of humping 'Wildflower' 
 Hanna Barbera faint I'm riding no Rivera 
 Verse Two: RZA 
 Fat-ass whips big asses, colourful lips 
 Wide hips, baller kits, chrome dipped wearing 
 Blue kicks, plus jeans booming beats 
 Loud horn beeps, crowded streets, the fusion yo 
 The heat is on, never too black or too strong 
 In one hour Wu-Tang Clan is about to perform 
 Police barricade, sidewalk crowded like parades 
 The arena now present, de event of the decade 
 Long braids and fades, baldheads, spangle waves 
 Extensions, nails Friday, just got paid 
 Headliner or marquee is the prime time rhyme crime family 
 That shines Godly light 
 Upon this Hip Hop artform, yo Dunn 
 We can't be measured by no chart, the God brung 
 Never bust premature for sure 
 You want it raw, let me plant my dynamite bitch 
 Deep inside your core, the explosion stops the menstruation 
 Causes stomach inflation 
 Patiently waiting nine months for deportation 
 Of the Earth from the Moon, black woman stay in tune 
 Yo God, let me pour y'all the science about the womb 
 It's a black hole for those who lose control 
 Fertile soil before you are wise 
 And spoiled many men and took many lives 
 And all you brothers changed sides 
 Only worth a decimal compared to those who died inside"
17,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,Supreme Clientele (Intro),"Tony Stark, makes you feel 
 He's the cool exec 
 With a heart of steel 
 As Iron Man all jets a-blaze 
 He's fighting and smiting with repulsor rays 
 Amazing armor, it's Iron Man 
 A blaze of power, It's Iron Man! 
 Iron Man, the armor clad superhero of the free world may be doomed to die. Yes, the life of America's most dramatic avenger may well hinge upon a delicate subminiature component containing the strange secret which keeps his injured heart beating and enables him to live as Tony Starks, one of the nation's leading cientists, head of Tony Stark Industries, and as... Iron Man!"

 Check it out though... aiyyo... 
 Scientific, my hand kissed it 
 Robotic let's think optimistic 
 You probably missed it, watch me dolly dick it 
 Scotty watty cop it to me, big microphone hippie 
 Hit Poughkepsie crispy chicken verbs throw up a stone richie 
 Chop the O, sprinkle a lil' snow inside a Optimo 
 Swing the John McEnroe, rap rock'n'roll 
 Tidy Bowl, gung-ho pro, Starsky with the gumsole 
 Hit the rump slow, parole kids, live Rapunzel 
 But Ton' stizzy really high, the vivid laser eye guide 
 Jump in the Harley ride, Clarks I freak a lemon pie 
 I'm 'bout it, 'bout it - Lord forgive me, Ms. Sally shouted 
 Tracey got shot in the face, my house was overcrowded 
 You fake cats done heard it first 
 On how I shitted on your turf 
 At times, Cuban Link verse yo 
 Check out the rap kingpin, summertime fine jewelry drippin 
 Face in the box, I seen your ear twitchin 
 As soon as I drove off, Cap' came to me with three sawed-offs 
 Give one to Rae', let's season they broth 
 Lightning rod fever heaters, knock-kneeder Sheeba for hiva 
 Diva got rocked from the receiver bleeder 
 Portfolio, lookin' fancy in the pantry 
 My man got bigger dimes son, your shit is scampi 
 Base that, throw what's in your mouth, don't waste that 
 See Ghost lampin in the throne with King Tut hat 
 Straight off 
 Yeah... yeah...

 To smack all y'all niggaz, and niggarettes 
 Universal death threats, yeah 
 This be the God Body, yeah no doubt 
 Judge Wise 
 Aiyyo spiced out Calvin Coolidge, loungin with 7 duelers 
 The Great Adventures of Slick, lickin' with 6 rugers 
 Rock those, big boy Bulotti's out of Woodridge 
 Porch for the biggest beer, season giraffe ribs 
 Rotissiere ropes, hickory scented mint scented glaze 
 Perfected find truth within self, let's smoke 
 All hail to my hands, 50 thou' appraisal 
 Dirty nose with the nasal drip, click flipped on fam 
 Dancin with Blanch and them bitches, flickin goose pictures 
 Kick down the ace of spades, snatch Jack riches 
 Olsive compulsive lies flies with my name on it 
 Dick made the cover now count, how many veins on it 
 Scooby snack jurassic plastic gas booby trap 
 Ten years workin for me, you wanna tap shit? 
 Bung bung bung! Your bell went rung rung rung! 
 Staple-Land's where the ambulance don't come 
 Yeah, you see what I mean? 
 You see what I mean, you motherfuckin crybabies? 
 Get in line punk! You should be studyin your odds 
 Instead of studyin me! 
 That's how you lost your first job punk 
 Now get in line, for you get your lil' thick-ass tossed up! 
 Shit! I studied under Bruce Lee nigga 
 He was on the fourth, I was on the third 
 (RZA) 
 Pass me a honey-dipped spliff, black mental cause continental drift 
 One whiff of Pow you gets my Divine stiff 
 Brick rock, late night, hear the tick tock of my clock 
 I used to run up and pick, a crab lock 
 Hit his stash, dip back, to the Lab, make him flip 
 Uptown, BOO-DOOP, now we back on your ass 
 Incognito, fatal aikido blow, pop a needle 
 Dick a knock-knee hoe, bust out her fetal 
 Nine inch long strong, Bobby pop the bitch thongs 
 Spit on her, then I banged on my chest like Kong King 
 Merciless Meng, point the killa bee sting 
 Ring DINGS, right through your head BING 
 Snap the wing off of bats, my battleaxe tongue hacks tracks 
 Once the ball drop, I'ma snatch ten jacks 
 Pass the crack to a niggarette, puff a looseleaf cigarette 
 While your man search the internet for +Bob Digitech in Stereo+ 
 Crazy as Shapiro 
 Multiply myself ten times standin next to zero 
 And snap my fingers like the Fonz 
 And bag me a golden bronze skinned girl with the honey blonde 
 Dip hair, make a nigga flip in his chair 
 Had the armpit shaved off perfect with the Nair 
 Stomach fat as a pancake for her man's sake 
 Used to fuck her when she menestraute 
 But it made her hyperventilate

20,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,Saturday Nite,"(Ghostface) 
 Yo... 
 Saturday night, Uptown 
 Ridin' past Kansas Fried Chicken 
 What's poppin' kid? We in the mix 
 It's chilly 40 below 
 Gate's closed gotta catch Dr. J's 
 Blowin' my hand, rub on my nose 
 Tap the glass, stop frontin Duke, fresh pair of jeans 
 Look I got loot, eleven in the Bass boots 
 Heard a screech pull up, these Jakes flashed me 5 pictures 
 One had my man's mug, Semi stepped brother hugs 
 You asked the wrong guy son 
 I'm from Melina, yeah we know Mr. Coles 
 Flew in two days ago to see his fam' 
 But we been watchin you, crazily 
 The whole Staten Island shittin on you 
 Wisdom Bird's pregnant out in Baisley 
 Hold up snow in your ear, fresh baldie tried to change up 
 Not trunk today, still lookin' fly, still slammed up hung 
 Your mom pop in your trunk, slow your pace 
 Starks fixed your face, copped out the 6, five years probat' 
 You dealin' with a lot of science, motherfucker we're watchin you 
 Make me wanna lick shots at you 
 You disgust me, screwin me down, grab my gun 
 Go 'head bust me, heard you hate Jake that's what it must be 
 Hands behind your back, spread your legs 
 Just found a roach in your tray 
 It's not mine fucker, what I said 
 You met the 13th nigga 
 A multimillion dollar operation is based upon it yo 
 Where in the Hell's the RZA? 
 He's sellin mics, wildest joints 
 Special made to go up in your hand and which went out on point 
 Switched to the next scene, I'm at the crib buggin out 
 On how po' live, hatin' plus harassin the kid 
 Park the truck in the double face garage 
 Dial 1-900-Raekwon, tell the God shit's mega 
 Reel flashin me on BET, Planet Groove, Rap City News 
 NAACP committees... {*abruptly ends*}"
21,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,Ghost Deini,"""In an enemy land..."" 
 ""Ack, just by destroying Starks Enterprises, 
 We could cripple their national defence. 
 So, you Professor Finkle, the world's greatest 
 Expert on electricity must devise the destruction 
 Of Starks' mighty guardian, Ironman."" 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Yo, summer time holdin' the 9, split the Vega in half 
 Jeeps rumble and my dogs puff grass 
 Bank stoppin', high-derox hydrolic 
 Kid with the most knowledge will obtain to touch top dollars 
 Hold me down, hand me my cake, dusty, bake, activate 
 Fuck your corny debates 
 I'm like cake or maybe like $10,000 rabbits 
 The kid walked through, switch up his accent ""Now I'm from Paris"" 
 Cash the bill, frozen element, Seagal 
 Signs from the most high causes me to break them all 
 How the fuck was y'all niggas thinkin'? You think I fell off the ledge? 
 The legendary Ghost Deini might be dead? 
 Never, Impossible, pull out black burners like tonsils 
 To gallants, hit 'em if we go to 
 Bustin' at y'all niggas daily 
 Wall-to-wall, Hawkins 
 Suckin your teeth 'cause God chain-talkin' 
 Like Ghostface this, Ghostface that 
 Ghost sold crack, now his revelations spoken through rap 
 Valored down like the sheik of Iran 
 Gasoline CREAM wrapped in hospital bands 
 Model vans, Michael Davis, it's me against housin 
 Extraordinary pro-black, sold God creations to control thousands 
 Catch me at the flicks, Apollo rap Fredick Douglas 
 You know what? Eh yo, fuck this 
 Eh yo, how can I move the crowd? 
 First of all, ain't no mistakes allowed 
 Here's the instructions, put it together 
 It's simple ain't it? Well, quite clever 
 *Singing* 
 Marvin, Marvin, you were a friend of mine 
 You stood for somethin', ugh 
 Tupac, Biggie, oh how we miss you so 
 We want y'all both to know 
 We really love you so 
 Eh yo, I'm Gucci down 
 Wally boot, Jamaican hat, long 4-pound 
 Ask niggas how I get down 
 Don't speak much, deluxe plush 
 Imaginations holdin' all like Willie Hutch 
 You might've bumped into me on the Riker's bus 
 Weed in my teeths, jem in my beauty sleep, sleeve 
 Dead serious, knowledge by 2% triple geese 
 Come on, we juggle mic's 
 We come on all the amps, advance the final 
 Show these niggas how the way we dance 
 Hot night, Jamaica 
 Came through in a boger green '68 Pacer 
 Had mad paper, high as a fuck 
 Truck, 2 rappers got stuck that night 
 I ain't sayin' no names, they know who, thank you for the change 
 Outdoor event, New Year's Eve, Cali weed 
 30 seconds till we tear and decease 
 Quick, call all my seeds dipped in the crowd 
 The hoe spotted me, knew not to call my name out 
 He walked off softly, we exactly 
 Formed like Christ and the disciples 
 Black fatigues, lethal-faced dunnie, he held the rifle 
 We had the whole shit shook, you favorite rapper's droppin' they drinks 
 On the low, tuckin they links, we made 80 off the books 
 (Superb) 
 It's like '86, Magic Johnson, no disrespect 
 My metaphors'll keep out The Projects 
 Rap connects'll keep me correct 
 Eh yo, I wrote this on Donnie roof 
 After his funeral, on one knee 
 Thinkin' his killer's followin me 
 So to my nigga Donnie, up there 
 Can you please tell God that we fucked up here? 
 We got beer, weed, guns, AIDS 
 All these obsticles, it's hard to make it nowadays 
 Watch the Devil in it, some say it's our fault 
 If that's the answer, you know smokin' can cause cancer 
 Let me drop a bracelet, leave a chain behind 
 My tape stay at the beginnin 'cause that's how they rewind 
 Y'all know how we dine, we don't eat swine, and we don't drink wine 
 If you don't bring me some motherfuckin cognac, I kill you 
 I can't feel you 
 Ain't in my senses, and you ain't in my dollars 
 I fuck with rockwilders, no leashes, no collars 
 Brolic scholars, that's Ghost Deini!"

 Uh-huh, uh-huh, motherfucker, uh-huh 
 Yeah, I see that, I see that 
 All y'all fake motherfuckers up in the joint, huh? 
 Stealin my light, huh? Watch me, duke, watch me 
 Yo, check these up top murderous 
 Snowy in the bezzle as the cloud merges 
 F.B.I. try and want word with this 
 Kid who punked out bust a shot uip in the becon 
 Catch me in the corner not speakin' 
 Crushed out heavenly, U.G. rock the sweet daddy long fox minks 
 Chicken and brocolli, Wally's look stinky 
 With his man straight from Raleigh Durham, he recognized Kojak 
 I slapped him five, Masta Killa cracked his tiny form 
 E'rybody break bread, huddle around 
 Guzzle that, I'm about to throw a hand in your bag 
 Since the face been revealed, game got real 
 Radio been gassin niggaz, my imposters scream they ill 
 I'm the inventor, '86 rhymin at the center 
 Debut '93 LP told you to Enter 
 Punk faggot niggaz stealin my light 
 Crawl up in the bed with grandma, 
 Beneath the La-Z-Boy where ya hid ya knife 
 Ghost is back, stretch Cadillacs, fruit cocktails 
 Hit the shells at Paul's Pastry Rack 
 Walk with me like Darthy tried to judge these 
 Plush degrees, said the cow, wrap the fees 
 Gettin' waxed all through the drive-through 
 Take the stand, throw my hand all on the Bible 
 And tell lies too, I'm the ultimate 
 Splash the Wolverine Razor Sharp ring, dolomite 
 Student in role holdin' it 
 (Chorus: Ghostface) 
 Aiyyo, this rappin's like Ziti, facin me real TV 
 Crash at high-speeds, strawberry, kiwi 
 As we approach, yo herb, the Gods bail 
 These Staten Island ferryboat cats bail 
 Fresh cellies, 50 thief up in the city 
 We banned for life, Apollo kids live to spit the real 
 (Ghostface) 
 A pair of bright phat yellow Air Max 
 Hit the racks, stack 'em up Son, $20 off no tax 
 Street merchant tucked in the cloud, stay splurgin 
 Rock a eagle head, 6-inch height was the bird 
 Monday night Dallas verse Jets, dudes slid in with one hand 
 Two culture-ciphers, one bag of wet 
 Heavy rain fucked my kicks up 
 Wasn't lookin', splashed in the puddle 
 Bitch laughin', first thought was beat the bitch up 
 Mossied off gracefully, New York's most wanted tee-ball hawk 
 Seen the yellow brick road, lust of pastries 
 Same Ghostface, holy in the mind 
 Last scene: Manhatten Chase 
 We drew the six-eight digit in the briefcase 
 Rawness, title is Hell-bound 
 Quick to reload around faces, surround look astound 
 (Raekwon) 
 We split a fair one, poker nose money 
 Gin rummy with glare, spot the lame, bit his ear 
 Yo, you taste a tea-spoon, 300 goons, stash baloons 
 Locked in lab rooms, hit with glock, stashed in Grant's Tomb 
 Clocked him like a patient, his stock's full, hustle invasion 
 Knowin' now, we cocked a block off, the chain tri-color 
 Freezin in valor, ice-sicle galore 
 Gas station light gleamin on the wall 
 Cop WiseGuy jams, James Bond vans 
 Niggaz flipped Timbs, rock boats under water, watch clams 
 Pose at the stand-off, mad timid 
 Hopin that the gun fall, guess him like lottery balls, yo"

 Wig, young black green beret 
 Chrome laser guns blazing at spades 
 Wallabies, cherry noose, kool-aid 
 10 niggas call it Tai-Chi 
 Black blades, one hundred dollar seats 
 Hold up, we at the opera 
 Queen Elizabeth rub on my leg 
 Had ketchup on her dress from a whopper 
 Chunky ass necklace 
 Must be her birthstone 
 John Paul cop the biggest stones outta Rome 
 Told ya eyes up on her prince 
 Fucking with Diana 
 Two rows across, Dirty giving hickeys to Vianna White 
 Fingering Pamela Lee 
 We on the balcony 
 Dare one of y'all to Malcolm X me 
 Somebody might catch a Kennedy 
 Yo let me adjust my lens 
 Through these binoculars 
 I paid 5 g's sliding off like Kid Vitamin

 Patriot of Broad Street 
 Bet you think I'm laying like a hyphen

 Tony Starks make the narc's dogs bark 
 With the Benz parked 
 Up against the boulevard 
 Starks had the bone sparked 
 One cop tapped the window glass 
 Like a cymbal crash, 
 ""What the fuck son! You trying to break glass?"" 
 He flashed his badge, 
 ""License and registrations"" 
 At that moment 
 His fat partner started chasin' 
 Chicken heads they was racing wit' they hearts pacin' 
 For snatching gold 
 Trying' to dip into the god's basement 
 Our location 
 Lead steel shed spread 
 Cracked shorty head 
 Left sweetie there for dead 
 Ghetto poodles 
 Fingers sticky from cheese doodles 
 Starving' for a 50 cent bag of Oodles and Noodles 
 Neighborhood sick wit' it 
 Clinton 'bout to cut WIC 
 Maybe one y'all rich rap niggas need to politic 
 Reach for the sky 
 They throw bleach in your eye 
 Don't teach you why 
 You be keeping 'em high 
 Dipped like an Oreo cookie 
 In cold milk, bold silk 
 Gold-filled cap, Wu wear hat, 
 Low tilt 
 True Islamic 
 We speak verbal rhyme phonics 
 Why y'all trying to change this hip hop to technotronics?

 Because of you I'm hurting 
 Within my within my heart 
 I know it's not right to be flirting 
 But a relationship has to start 
 You're the one that I'm clocking 
 It's time for you to start jocking 
 Don't want you to see me cry 
 This is why this is why this is why

 I met this girl named Rhonda from way down yonder

 Never tell a lie, like George with the cherry tree 
 Now it's cherry pie - if it's not broke, let it be 
 Ain't nuttin nice in - New York 
 Stick you for your cake and your icing 
 That tough talk? Don't mean nuttin when you're up North 
 So keep them hands where I can see 'em like you want freedom 
 You know that saying - if you can't join 'em, beat 'em 
 And push your way in 
 We ain't acrobats but we flip on occasion 
 Pick the pace up, pants saggin pull your waist up

 Body you in the bed where the nurses are 
 Put your vein out, watch me insert the dart 
 Till it plagues from Bricks to the Persian Gulf 
 Light circuits off, thirty-third of my brain is off 
 That explains why my language off 
 My gun aim and cough, y'all ain't trained to brawl 
 Y'all more like in trainin bras 
 Wet behind the ear, you're not prepared 
 For the project flow, with extra stairs 
 I pass out a vest to wear (bullets, FLYIN) 
 Yo, the hard wire, startin barn fires 
 Pullin mad, so you know it's me 
 And your weed got more seeds than ODB 
 Can't smoke witcha, watch Ghost tie rope to ya 
 Def and Wu will open ya 
 (Method) 
 ... Eat a dick like (HUH) 
 Baby shake your shit, girl you're thick like (HUH) 
 Gettin' rich like ... 
 ... ""There's no love to be found"" 
 (Ghostface) 
 Word... it's me y'all... 
 We in two-six's flirtin with bitches 
 Dime plus takin' pictures, how you doin' baby? My name Ghost 
 Don't get caught up in my chains, or the way that I speak 
 Seek intelligence, slickest nigga goin' since ""Grease"" 
 Check out the grays on the side of my waves 
 I grew those on Riker's Island 
 Stretched out, balled up in the caves 
 Pull a boot out on Jimmy Jam, text takes jam 
 Silky texture, Jordan jumped up like Clyde Drexler 
 All up in the parrot, nose numb, real as they come 
 Biggie's Versace's, snow white rabbit 
 Hands is like photographic magic, funeral love 
 Movin when we hug, don't make it a habit 
 Hit the gym for two weeks, come back all chiseled 
 Elbows unique now, meet the new me 
 Ghettofabulous, Ton' Atlas 
 Zulu Nation in the 80's in front of Macy's 
 I start my own chapters 
 Tyco nightglow velvet pose, special effects 
 High-tech armors merc you at the shows 
 Supercalifragalisticexpialidocious 
 Dociousaliexpifragalisticcalisuper 
 Cancun, catch me in the room, eatin grouper... 
 (Method) 
 Shoe fly shoo, Wally Don Clark crew 
 Fuck y'all wanna do? Crack a brew, smoke an L or two 
 And flip like (HUH) 
 Killin' for the whole click is sick like (HUH) 
 You and your stank bitch eat a dick like (HUH) 
 Baby shake your shit, girl you're thick like (HUH) 
 Gettin' rich like (HUH) Yeah...

25,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,Mighty Healthy,"My God, so they are killers. 
 I've heard lots of people say once a man's a killer, they just keep 
 On killing and killing; they sort of develop a taste for blood. 
 -Yeah, that's right. They kill one man, or kill ten, 
 It's all the same (yes). After all, THEY CAN ONLY HANG YOU ONCE. 
 Both hands clusty, chillin' wit my man Rusty low down 
 Blew off the burner kinda dusty 
 The world can't touch Ghost, purple tape Rae co-host 
 Monty Hall expo, intellect you red pro 
 Son triflin fuck, wildflower on the cyclin 
 Pick up the brew thought I was Michael an' 
 Mics are writin' pool, now, I'm into Iron Duals 
 Turn-ons the Earth's whoopee, she out of law school 
 In hale break beats of hell A-Alikes propel parallel 
 Duracell night, you flash a burnt cell 
 Snap out of CandyLand, kids the old rumor is 
 Blacks become immune to shit, we never did like 
 Eati' dead birds chose the pharmacy over herbs 
 Men marryin men, ill they got the herbs pulsar 
 Scissor hand wig vanished in the winter 
 Livin' off land you god damn right I fuck fans king me 
 Check checkmate props like the micro chip founder 
 Neck to neck stocks with Bill Gates now 
 When we hug these mics we get busy 
 Come and have a good time with G-O-D 
 Make you snap your fingers or wiggle 
 Scream, shout, laugh and just giggle 
 Shake that body, party that body 
 Don't fuck with Ghost you'll feel sorry 
 That's word, I'm not the herb 
 Understand what I'm sayin' (echo) 
 Hit mics like Ted Koppel, rifle expert 
 Let off the Eiffel, burn a flag in the grass it's spiteful 
 Ringleader set it off, rap Derek Jeter 
 Culprit, prince of the game wish you could see us 
 We lay low glitter wax full bangles 
 Priceless rolls, lay around the God get tangled 
 Woolly hair, eyes firey red, feet made of brass 
 Twelve men, following me, it be the God staff 
 Move, every script's like Miramax 
 Smash the big boy totalled it, will shot fear effects 
 Son beamin' wifee on the beach, sippin' Zima 
 Wu 'binos, to latinos, we bust Selena 
 Over night, God schedules, fed ex 
 Pretty soloette velvet nice DNA scroll genetics 
 Too hot, to handle one thought scramblin the mandolin 
 Hundred game Wilt Chamberlain, smack em, say when 
 He rollin' up, face wrinkled up, hands is on his nuts 
 Yo kid stop frontin' on the ground before you get touched 
 It's Canada Dry sess, obsessed with Allah's sun 
 We want rye, we want it so bad we might cry 
 -What we do, depends on breath control, so it's the first thing you must 
 Learn. Fortunately it's easy. You'll soon learn. 
 - My God so they are killers 
 - Killing and killing, they sort of develop a taste for blood"

 I might give 'em to my brother-in-law 
 Fitzpatrick, ribs battered, worth more than Egyptian marrows 
 Borrow the God jewels, Gucci goggles 
 That's how the God do, Motown twenty-five 
 My office like Smokey's voice, little moist, but choice 
 We guzzle Dom's, smoke the scratchy throats 
 Live on the edge, bracelets, shades and classy coats 
 Jungle in the club, we play Colombo 
 Frost eat a snowman, frozen as the milky way 
 Ice on the floor, El-Producto in the sleeve 
 In the seam of his mink, he said ""Don't drink""

 Bought a lot of clothes and just played the ave. 
 Now we rap niggas with a lot of wardrobes 
 And if we want a nigga dead we pay the cash 
 I ain't tryin' to waste my career on y'all 
 Even scuffle with y'all, waste gear on y'all 
 But if I gotta go out, you know I'ma show out

 Got big boy toys, Porsche, Sixes 
 Dime bitches, told y'all before we import those 
 Jury stay froze, court cases get closed 
 Niggas hate Nino 'cause how fast I roast them 
 Like George Jefferson and em, steppin on em

 Drop that, Ghost listenin, the track sizzlin

 Best sellers, but niggas stay together 
 Posted up trucks, leanin on the Benz 
 Cinemax smile shot in thrity-five lens 
 You program, broke bottles of Dom 
 Seven inch bangles, back breakers 
 I'm a dope feed, look at my art, Popeye strength 
 Rap with a British accent, Gucci clothes 
 Dennis Coles in the latest fashions 
 Blow backs in, flip raps like forty-eight bundles 
 Dinner plates, deadly front gates, celeb Brian Gumble

 Interlapse this in like Deniro, words in your center earhole 
 Blocks of ice like Sub-Zero, we been right since day zero 
 Shatter your soul like glass windows 
 Turn verses to nymphos, pop these hollows at fake cats in a Tahoe 
 Wild out, throw your liquor bottles at hood rats to the richest models 
 We conversate like Christ and the twelve apostles 
 Livin' life without you, can't count you as great men 
 Murderers in the state pen', bein caged in 
 The wage is a sin, before they read up they pop our tape in 
 You ain't gotta tuck you chain in 'cause here we want the head of Satan

 One kid hollerin what lookin' up, he the big wig 
 Fake ass cat, low life, sodomize mind 
 Beatin' niggas, big bricks of bread sellin mad dimes 
 His feet hurt, networkin he get no work 
 Yo smack him where his hand hurt, fuck what he worth 
 Yo he sucked his thumb smooth for the kid laced with the big guns 
 Stain to my Baltimore niggas that he on the run 
 Plus he ill in the drums, heartburn for life, calcium man 
 Watch him grab the Tums, he's a front 
 Pigeon totalist sister with the fat ass 
 Show hash behind up the block plus he smashed her 
 Big Bub did him somethin' deadly, act premedidtated 
 Buck 60 strike was the medley 
 Nice like Van Halen, seen him at the tunnel with his skin peelin 
 Did two days thought he was jailin 
 You get close, look at his hands 
 That's the same kid that cut his wrists, talkin' 'bout the cuffs did it 
 He ran away, frontin majorly, eyes like Sammy Davis jr. 
 Rounded off with a fade g, he sport the Bob Hope classics 
 Ran down Asics, Kmart, the short sleeve shit be the basics 
 He eat hams shitted on himself twice, big hatted Jews 
 Rushed the nigga out in Crown Heights 
 Yo let me tell you how the game go 
 We gettin' rid of all the prostitutes 
 Tony wants the streets back fo sho 
 Too many hustlers, too many thieves 
 We're fuckin' up who's willin' to fight and teach the c's 
 Too much TV, guns and robberies 
 Lust and greed and hate the 4 devils jealousy 
 (Ghostface) 
 Yo I champunch Mase in his face over some bullshit 
 The other night they kidnapped his brother pokin it with knives 
 It's rainin, 85 degrees kinda muggy 
 One of the nights they thrown in his face it's real ugly 
 Yo we up in Jonesy's posin, all these niggas know me 
 >From fuckin' wit, under theses niggas heavy parolees 
 Yo we played the speaker 
 And from a distance we could see these chains 
 The P slayed, flat on his chest, was two plains 
 Ashy hands yo, no need for rings at all 
 He just cracked the V8 backed up, leaned against the wall 
 Lookin' flower, he just came home, he on like a fuck 
 Did a dime for holdin' up the gods up in the armored truck 
 Ten years later son 280 on the weight tip 
 He throwin' up six plates plus he studied Matrix 
 He's a wally horse shout it out sweatin through his valor 
 Cock-eyed nigga back up his neck he had shores 
 Sammy eagerly rode up on him, taxi off the turkey with the joint 
 On him 
 Flower look his man stood up before him 
 The bitches hit the table, Jah king stripped off his cables 
 Shots went off, Sam'll get a chance to make his debut 
 Flower grabbed Tiff his man with the sideburns, hat fell off 
 We nerd his wigworms, he hid behind Rich 
 See Allah hit the light switch, young girls were trampled 
 In the measured pool, pistol with Mase, and broke the handle 
 Desperate crawlin to the door on all fours 
 Shim kicked the jukebox the theme song rode in was ""It's Yours"" 
 Oh my goodness, Ba grabbed the Mo bottle thrashin 
 He layin like a gay models shoutin out Sebastian 
 He smiled with his teeth missin' begging for mercy 
 No more god, the 68 thousand down a pair of three 
 Out came the cannon, whistled out zaggin 
 Cham snatched his flag four big rocks enter the dragon

 Pretty little Sally sat up by the tree trunk 
 White miniskirt with a Betty Boom bum 
 She had a ass like Deborah Cox, face like Lauryn 
 Waist like a Coke bottles scoring 
 Pretty young thing loved the swings 
 And times she got my ding-a-ling hard 
 When she said push hard, she kept vaseline 
 Open as she swung back, couldn't help her dress blue back 
 Now held accountable right for my actions 
 Right before the Wallabee Champ was rockin' wallows 
 Drawin crads, sent her rap message through a bottle 
 Lines from Dolomite, few tips from Goines 
 Birthday, gave her two 50 cent coins 
 Puppy love, gorgeous face, amazed by lip gloss 
 Cherry cent, when the princess spoked yo it bounched off 
 Mole like Marilyn Monroe, threw a rose in her mouth 
 Wherever God go will be Mrs. Coke 
 Girl's so pretty, kids with little niddys 
 Hope the years go slow, slow 
 Surrounded by intelligence, life through education 
 Healthy minds will grow, grow 
 Catch me on a bus-stop, dustin, cursin out 
 The cops are still coming, vibe with me 
 Everybody's talking about Wu-Tang fronting 
 But you still telling lies to me 
 Beautiful in lightshows, having no intentions on love 
 But having strung eyes of oppose, here we go 
 It's not the way she bubbed the gum, shooked her ass 
 I'm not the one, double dus, waiting for the bus 
 The faggot Nore son, now year later 
 Lady 7th floor, building 7-80 
 Fancy fox, booties for her socks, nothing else can change me 
 Young Nefertiti, knowledge seed with no jewelry on 
 Tahitian fresh berry tree, she's a capricorn 
 I really liked the girl, had dreams about her 
 Thinking to myself some nights she got (""powered"") 
 But hating, was Shinene and Grace and Key-lolo 
 Trick bitches jumped my boo at the school a few years ago 
 Hit me, you hit me, Grace got the last hit 
 Eh yo, the bitches started swinging and shit 
 So I jumped in 
 Those were the days, made faces in school plays 
 Paper trays, city wide test, made half a days 
 Shooting puppy water, might hump the pillow, dick a inch taller 
 Stapleton bum nigga, I pop a cherry for her 
 Fresh air fun, here's dunn, alphabets, berets 
 Jellies, bubble yum, soda tongue, too young to cum 
 Then engage him with them candy rings 
 Eh yo, I hit that shit, got jealous when she kissed Rob 
 I broked her chicko's sticks 
 (Outro: Ghostface Killah) 
 Guys and girls, y'all remember those days, and shit 
 Girls walk around in school, one ponytail with the beret 
 Next looking like baby powder, youknowhatImean? 
 Those were the days right there 
 Boston baked beans, girls come to school with mad candy 
 YouknowhatImean? You'd just come in school for half days, and all that 
 Just to see that little girl right there, ? to this 
 Go home and think about it, youknowhatImean? 
 May hump the bed sometimes on her, youknowhatImean? 
 Word, those days man, those, those were the good old days right there G 
 That shit was fun, lunchroom, see in the lunchroom, youknowhatImean? 
 Might get a little, go to the G.O. Store or something, youknowhatImean? 
 Word, buy a little chocolate, a little shake or something, youknowhatImean? 
 A little buttercrunch joints or something, youknowhatImean? 
 That's that real shit, G I miss those shits, man 
 I wanna go back to school, man

 Brooklyn jumpin' - it's girls by the thousands 
 Heart-throb music - girls come out your blouses 
 Shakin' ya ass - it's Cherchez Laghost 
 She could hustle with a sick style - jump off the boat! 
 Everybody's in the song - no bad boys 
 Scene hot and muggy - you might end up in the wrong house 
 You hear the feelin' - snatch that boy 
 He a herb - catch him for a brand new toy 
 (Madam Majestic, (Ghostface Killah), {U-God}) 
 They'll take all your rhymes with a Colgate smile, hey baby

 They'll love you one second, then hate you the next

 Always will be my friend, Ghostface Killah 
 (Truly yours, peace boo)

 Keep ya frown son if you ain't gettin' laid

 Yo, too advanced, Digi' stance, made the CD enhanced 
 I move with the speed and strength of ants 
 Identical in form with the Beez they swarm 
 Hold up the cold current appear warm 
 My first verbal brawl, started on some yes yes y'all 
 To the beat y'all, break your windshield, your jeep stall 
 Mr. Traffic, dumbin shit, from ecclesiastic 
 Cashier, holdin' out, fine, cut off the plastic 
 See the logo? A monument in hip-hop 
 Carved out, in the giant landscape, of broken rocks 
 Whether heard in herb spots, jukebox or malt shops 
 Uncut live, drop eighty-five, in one shot 
 Spotlight hits the metal mic, majority stare 
 Heard the Wu snare, while my iris cut down the glare 
 Walk a road the great length you find too long to measure 
 My Clan a make me rhyme like D. Banner under pressure 
 No surprise, double disc touched five 
 Those elements, kept environments colonized 
 With the high flyin death-defyin flow like the Rebel 
 Right there, but you're one light year, from my level 
 (Ghostface) 
 Uh-huh... yeah... yo... check it... yo... 
 Bottles goin' off in the church, we broke the wine 
 Slapped the pastor, didn't know Pop had asthma 
 He pulled out his blue bible, change fell out his coat 
 Three condoms, two dice, one bag of dope 
 Ooh! Rev. ain't right, his church ain't right 
 Deacon is a pimp, tell by his eyes 
 Mrs. Parks said, ""Brother Starks, meet you at the numbers spot 
 Heard you got red tops out, and I want a lot"" 
 Shirley fainted dead on the spot 
 Two ushers slipped eighty dollars right out the pot 
 Oh shit!

 No doubt, all we saw he bought, Lori mom's all blow 
 Was simple, blamp instrumentals run camps the stamps get you 
 The way we lamp, fans come and get you 
 Play, fullback strapped like a fuck, war at 
 The black, Carlo Gambino's stash house in Hackensack 
 Pack capsules, Green Bay 'em lay 'em down like wax do 
 It's all actual we build, like Crash Crew

 Wu thousand nothin' but hardcore 
 We tryin' to get land riches and more 
 Ghost put me on to it 
 We just do it, floss or whatever 
 Take care of the business, there's too many roughnecks 
 Give two of these to Flex, tell him it's real rap like Ghost 
 Had to beat niggaz with toast 
 Clubs V.I. clientele we lay it down flat 
 Poot out on y'all kid, now where your man's at? 
 Fakin the real like, ""Damn I can't stand Cappa'"" 
 Then my wardrobe flooded the next chapter 
 Y'all heard about us like we heard about you 
 Bless the mic with reality, hit you with the virtue 
 Calm down not tryin' to hurt you, burst through

 In Pam's house there was money missing 
 She was too dumb, had her nose numb, sniffin blow in the kitchen 
 Her kids never ate, PCW involved with her 
 Kids that she never seen shipped through to Florida 
 Maxine dark skinned and bal' headed bitch mean 
 Pams right here together they're the coldest fiends 
 Ah! Shit! Guess who arrived at the door 
 It's Moony the supplier swung open the door 
 Bitch open the door, Maxine he go'n kill me 
 Chill I got a friend cop, girl you don't know it's beef

 Back in the dollar bill he sniffed like six lines 
 He put his Gat down, why he do that? 
 Creeping through the crib is Maxine pot holdin' down with the grits 
 Pam sucking his dick, Maxine Al Greened him screaming slipped in piss 
 He ran into Ceas' room, grits down cryin' aight with his balls out 
 He stepped on Clarences' Biggie Smalls album 
 Mooney get that niggaz, Pam yelling rip that niggaz 
 Mooney went and got that dye out the kitchen 
 James jumped on Moon, poked him with a screw driver 
 Broke the TV Niggaz watching Knight Rider 
 This is Pam Jerkins mother house the same shit go on in her brother house 
 (Ghostface) 
 You know Mooney is only a buck o'five wet 
 He only had two hundred dollars worth of shit 
 And the kids tore his ass up, the Ceas had a huddle up 
 I felt sorry for'm, the funny shit when bowlegged Keke hopped on 'im 
 Jumped on him pigeon toed Moony poured dye on him 
 You should've seen his motherfuckin' face fryin', half dyin' 
 They stuck a fork through his nuts 
 The little girl was happy she beat the brotha up 
 Quick pick the window up Mooney over heard 
 Right before they threw him out the Nigga said Word!?! 
 On the count of three he landed on the first floor balcony 
 Blood brains splashed... he was dead? and the cops never came

 So I stepped back, sized the whole situation patiently 
 Arguments, face up in the air like you hatin' me 
 Ask you one question, was it good? 
 He have you on the wall like me, was it hood? 
 You probably showed him your sexy faces, how you ride on top 
 Grabbin the sheets, in a deep zone if he hit the spot 
 I came home on Friday, Saturday I found out 
 That night I cried with the kids, I was out 
 And my man, I'ma do him in 
 And the Lord knows best what I'ma do to him

 Let me find out you got men around my kids

 Brushin off his 88 clocks, y'all can't touch him 
 I bet a wad on it, y'all can't fuck with him 
 Semi-shy, and I'm laid back, crystal hats 
 Heard ya water broke I was like ""Phewww"" and ran back 
 I ran back fast, broke my arm in the mix 
 To find out that bird nigga tappin my shit 
 It's all right 'do, maybe he came up with the right dough

 Coughin' and bleedin', even barfin' and wheezin' 
 Son they called for a year at Oz and we gon' make it even 
 +Burning Season+, Lord, keep all prawn on the head, Lord 
 The more beef they bring Killa, the mark steak to grease off 
 One shot nearly took a cheek off, should've seen him leapin' 
 And dancin', had all intention to smack him and jack him like Jackie lease, son

 ""Peace bushes, trees, hello. How was your day? Have you seen the Prince?"" 
 ""Haven't seen him since he pushed Humpty Da-Dumpty fell off the fence"" 
 The Smurfs fell out laughin', Heckle told Jeckle at min 
 Lend him your Medicaid card, he's a good friend 
 Bugs still sniffin', Daffy Duck snitchin' 
 And heard that crazy Bird took the stand on the Simpsons 
 Bet cha' my golly, oh glory 
 with a story to tell 
 Droopy got knocked, now he Muslim in jail 
 His name is Abdrool, colorful Snow White tattoo 
 She used to send him mad flicks and casserole 
 In the cack too old girl who's clackin' her shoes 
 And that wicked witch broke her broom, clappin' at Scoob 
 It happens every night, I seen it, shoot outs at Jellystone Park 
 Kermit had the whip, he dipped from the narks 
 They bagged Woody, Shaggy shot dead in his hoodie 
 Tweety did the Bird, ""I thaw, I thought I thaw a putty"" 
 Ghost, please you don't even want to know 
 Droop-a-Long wrote a song, like the hear-a, here it go... 
 Ricochet Rabbit had a habit, he was savage 
 Bluto slapped Magoo, tha slap had his glasses backwards 
 Magilla used to come to class with ratchets 
 He was known in the hood, plus good for his classics 
 Slashes 
 Glass four-fifths, diamond cut, hollow point tips 
 Big Boy bustin' out 
 His corduroy fits eleven 
 Way beyond is little boy fit 
 Magoo, he gon' catch him at the teachers' conference 
 So later that week durin' open school night 
 Everybody there saw an open school fight 
 Blows is big, Olive Oil was pissed 
 The wolf was too, they murdered one of the pigs 
 Some say, ""What great big heat you have"" 
 He replied, ""Fuck my gun I'll eat you fast"" 
 Some say, ""What great big teeth you have"" 
 ""Mothafu- you better look at all the beef you have""

 That's what he gets for ass betting Snoopy's Cee-lo 
 Goofy had kilos, big hole in his nose, wig froze

 Peter Pan's the man, he heard Bambi was blooded 
 She chopped Ms. Piggy, she's superior in her set

 Ex-killers, we gon' ride to the death for the skrilla

 Always oil my guns and inspect my triggas 
 Sometimes I call my lawyer just to check my figures 
 He told me not to worry, all cheques is clearin' 
 So fuck my rhymes, I got the best appearance 
 And I survive through project experiences

 Watch you break your all, big sixes 'cause I'm a nigga who don't like to fall 
 High roller, see how my dice kiss 
 Push you pay me, and if I roll trips you pay me twice bitch

 Head cracks is all you see when I'm hot

 My hand is like a gun, feel the heat when it's cocked

 The drinks is on you tonight, from my peeps in the spot

 Glittered out, stout face, teck, Rae up in the Hilton 
 Heard Nia Long is in the building 
 Penthouse fashion, ordered out room service 
 It looked bugged cause the waiter looked nervous 
 Lift off the lid, seen two shiny thirty-eights aimed at the kid 
 What I do, duck! 
 Rae up in the shower singing 
 Son don't know that it's real 
 Coming looking like he about peel something 
 In a tight jam, red down, matching like santa 
 If I could just reach my hammer 
 He bust two shots, I played mice 
 Ran to the spot were the sun was at, quickly he was blinded by the ice 
 That's when Rae ran out of the back 
 Towel on, soap on his arms, spit duke around, fell on my lap

 Yo, what the fuck happened?

 It was a set up to get wet up

 Starks your bleeding

 Ten G's down the drain 
 Yo hurry up, we got to get him up 
 Get the sheets son, let's fix him up 
 Lock the door, turn the TV off, your kicks is near the light switch

 Slipped on soap 
 Landed on his back, with his gat, now that's dope 
 We got three minutes, nobody seen shit 
 Somebody might have heard shit 
 Singing on some Martin, were my momma bird shit 
 Fuck your socks, that's when we heard the door knock 
 Everything all right? Partying son, balloons popped 
 Threw this dude under the bed 
 A half dressed Raekwon, swallowing diamonds 
 Had money in juice up on his wedding day 
 The phone rang off, the tea kettle blew, wifey hitting me, 
 What you want sweaty, lima beans and kidney 
 Trashed the beeper, slowly I reached for the reefer 
 Throw a Costa, peep oh son the house keeper 
 Soap suds dripping from his nuts, cut up gut 
 Praying how me make it out the telly and touch

 Flew out the next day, back to the Tony estates 
 Blew on the first class flight to L.A. 
 It ain't take long, I pulled a few strings on the horn 
 So were it came from? 
 That nigga we stuck and took the caine from 
 We should have killed him when we had him 
 Yo I was holding a Magnum 
 Yeah we bagged him, but we let him slide in the wagon 
 His bad little brown ho, from out Chicago 
 She move his cargo, good at handling Roscoes 
 We had our eyes closed God, we should have seen it coming 
 He should have seen me coming, running out the shower gunning 
 Now that I figured it, she put the waiter on 
 It all came to me, in back of my mind, just like my favorite song 
 Dawned on me later on 
 By then the day was gone 
 How dare this nigga even think that he could take us on 
 Smoke the Cee Allah 
 Sent the kite through the Pens 
 Him and big Dan 
 Known to split wigs, with razor sharp gems 
 Giants from Attica riots 
 Halls is quiet 
 CO's with babies on their arms look tight 
 And this nigga from down state got shipped up north 
 Stocky young fella, running his lips on how he set it off

 When I bus take off past the light that ass better Run 
 An' don't look back (no), hide if you have to 
 Dollar vans, just Run into boats if he have to 
 Even got a .38, don't give me no hastle 
 When that little brown book in your pocket read Mathew's

 So Run little doggy, wolves is comin'

 My skills is a fortune, robbin' leech out a suite auction 
 Teach then fall off the greatest, fuck what they say 
 'Cause we against the abortions, and we 
 Lay low-oh-oh, silent those clownin' foes 
 Got them clothes for his new funeral

 Get retarded, and once you -- I'mma fix these artists 
 Take 'em one by one, tie 'em up, line 'em up 
 Treat 'em like a cigar, fire them niggaz up 
 Heavy up in the club, six/three tree'd up 
 With them young cats with their gear all beat up 
 This is how I'mma kill 'em with four lines left 
 Hold your breath, say my name five times it's take's practice, yo 
 Decap' him with sayin' my name, it's like matches, yo

 'Scuse me Mr. D.J., please play ""Fish"" 
 Or that ""CherChez"", live meeting, ten four, may day-may day 
 Callin' all cars, callin' all cars 
 We have an APB on Starks and Trife the God 
 We left the jewelry store, feelin' like we left the morgue 
 We was frozen, and I brought an iced out Trojan 
 That's for pussies who's golden, who got Toney wide open 
 I put my ring up to my man's waves and seen an ocean 
 Move like a wolf, kid, in sheep's clothing 
 Snatch the money bag off the milk truck and kept boating 
 I be potent like ibuprofen, I be coastin' 
 With two shotties on me, in your grimiest lobby smokin'

 This muthafucka made the clock!

 Y'all niggaz better kill me, my street niggaz feel me

 These rap niggaz sware that they so safe 
 I don't wanna talk to you holmes, I don't communicate 
 My guns they in my hand, one in my palm 
 And I could dial your number, like a smile off the face 
 With the H.K. 9, I'm the all black hummer 
 Metal lungies'll spit the grungiest shit 
 Hungriest shit, seventeen dummies a clip 
 Tell them rap niggaz to suck my dick, fuck the industry

 Her name was Kim, this light skinned girl from Shaolin 
 Stood by my side when my world was caved in 
 She cooked for me, fix me up, plus made me happy 
 Every time she told me she loved me, I said ""no backsies"" 
 I was fucked up in the game, migranes 
 No honey in pockets, all I had was a chain 
 Fourty-five stainless, it got so deep 
 I threw the heat to my dome 
 She said ""If you shoot, you ain't the real Pretty Tone"" 
 Baby, come home, you not alone, be strong whether right or wrong 
 Our bond is even more stronger when the light is gone 
 Say, ""Yo, Starks relax, you know I got the hot water runnin' 
 Baby, oiled down, pots in the oven"" 
 And my lovin'? It's gone when they style old fashion 
 And, a, don't worry bout that jam, you gonna smash 'em 
 Whose asking, your style has come 
 Stay focused, keep it cool, you know I love you 
 Love you too, babe, thank you

 Help the kid get on out, every obstacle 
 Long talks at night, arguments and still try'nna solve 
 Whether who is right, we mad tight 
 And the way she, never call the cops on a nigga 
 Got me, open, even more on her with her bangin' body 
 My favorite sweetheart, cum, but don't ever stop 
 Your love, give me every drop, you kiss get's me very hot 
 Never felt feelings before, and felt so sure 
 Every time you put it on me, I fiend for more 
 Think that's the reason why, can't leave, can't lie 
 Look you dead in the eye 
 Word to fuck up, like Ralph, baby, your the greatest 
 I'mma sell my guns, and with the cash I'mma bring you to Vegas

 The way we stopped them, dear (stopped them dear)

 To all the ladies who love they man 
 Though they fuck up, and you still let them back in 
 Make some noise if you cook and you clean for 'em 
 Out of love, doing juks for them 
 To all my niggas who love a girl with good brains on 'em 
 Baggin' to get your name tattoed on 'em 
 Kiss 'em in the morning, hold 'em, definitely show 'em

 Pumping coke out the spot smacking fiends in the kitchen 
 All around dick sucks whenever 
 Blowing chronic out of Phillies, getting flusty in the Cube' Link era 
 Niggas telling me my spot is hot 
 They like, ""I think anyday now, playboy, shit gon' pop‿ 
 Back then I was the fat Ghost, it came March 1st 
 My ace {Bakool?} got merked I burned for all our work 
 After the funeral I played low 
 Counting my last ten Gs, three weeks later yo I'm back in the {P's?} 
 Gathering up information, checking faces 
 Keeping the 45 auto loaded like it was bases 
 When it get dark better believe my mark 
 I heard a voice through a bullhorn the white man he said, ""yo Starks 
 You're surrounded, put down your gun look at the ruger 
 It's nothing but cops nigga, you better not run 
 Over... And I'm not laughing 
 (The masquerade... the masquerade) 
 My, my my, good days is over 
 11.40am in the Best Western 
 I'm with my bat blue her ass back and chest in 
 Slob my knob yeah no question 
 This my main bat, she thorough like that so we don't use protection 
 But the night before my wiz must of checked my phone 
 How'd she got the code? Psh, I don't know 
 Next thing she laying in the tel' lobby 
 She spotted me tipping the doorman, holding hands with my bitch beside me 
 My heart dropped, everything stopped, scared to death 
 Told my broad to keep it moving 'cause I just got knocked 
 Don't turn around, as soon as she did she bust a shot 
 Plus she tough security dropped when she touched the glock 
 I had the dumb face on, long face on 
 Didn't say shit, not even cough or spit, my bitch was gone 
 There goes the car, house, {?} jury, court date, judges 
 My shorty tried to screw me"

 Let me break it down for you, all I wanted to know 
 If I could just feel it and touch it, and break it down into numbers and 
 Come with me and just leave your friends

 And you would swear it was Lil' Kim lips 
 Eh, I really like you baby 
 Do you know how to wife this lady? 
 Give me what I want, don't talk, don't touch 
 Unless you got a bank account that make my face blush

 Tone Stark, a poet's art, kiss the girls 
 And bake them pies, clean up, some are old darts 
 This that real live don' shit, you heard! 
 (Chorus: Ghostface Killah) 
 Yo, they lick forty rounds, today 
 Okay, plus the shit is mad hot around the way 
 Niggas don't give a fuck on any time or day 
 Or if he dyin' today, or could he find a way 
 Blow niggas over 'turt, bitches, dimes and trays 
 Blow a nigga a jewel and watch him slide away 
 It's like that, in the hood, he in the grimy say 
 But what we try'nna say is gonna ""be this way"" 
 It don't have to... it don't have to... ""My God!"" 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 With big carrots and static, with that leaves the bad habits 
 Drugs layin' in buildings with great big automatics 
 Anonimos' in the hood, it's a fact, we could do magic 
 Splatter faggots in lobbies, the heat burn off his eyelashes 
 Don't try to pass this, back up or you'll receive something 
 Real tragic, them hollows'll race through your jacket 
 Semi gangstas with weak tactics 
 Forensic scientists called in to display graphics 
 For square inch to his back winds 
 They brain is spleen, it's left all over a fiend's mattress 
 Bastard, we cock and squeeze after we leave our ratchets 
 We keep the hood cryin' for massive havoc 
 No Trix we take from silly rabbits, yo feed them lead carrots 
 The little man'sll connect and they touch that fabric 
 The only thing that can stop 'em is that tephlon phat shit 
 Maybe artillery's heavy like a bunch of fat chicks 
 Brrrr... baow! Ain't no comin' back bitch!

 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Yo, yo, yo, aiyo you brought me on Jerry just to take you back 
 After that bullshit you put me through a couple months back 
 That wasn't right, call the cops on me, and told them I had it like 
 ""Yeah, pop the trunk, he got dope and guns"" 
 Check for warrants, that son of a bitch on the run, I know 
 Three of his niggas got life, he use to roll with 
 And told 'em I bodied an upcoming basketball star 
 Once I heard that, I fell out the cop car, real hard 
 You bugged out, and thugged out, wanted me to take you back 
 That could never happen, I'm sorry 
 No disrespect, but you a psycho, honey 
 Got that S.S.I. money, and you start actin' funny 
 Shrimp's every night, ordering steaks 
 Them jumbo joints, them shits cost a buck 50 for eight 
 And when you told me your Merlo, need more grapes 
 I said ""Honey, you never had wine before!"" 
 And if you did, that's not how you act at all 
 And no... that's not how we rock in Theodore 
 (Chorus: Ghostface Killah (Jacki-O)) 
 Please, babe, I love you 
 (Take me back, I'll never do it again) 
 Always want you 
 (You know that you my lover and my best friend) 
 Yes, darling, it's true 
 (Come on, home, where you belong, let's get it on) 
 Please, babe, I want you... 
 (Jacki-O) 
 Back to them days, when the yay' was bein' frontin' to you 
 Hundred thousand dollar shopping sprees wasn't nothin' to you 
 When three was a crowd... but I dealt with it 
 And your sex wasn't wild... but I dealt with it 
 I always felt shitted, you should of take me back 
 The girl that introduced you to boy, and helped you open your stacks 
 I got you in South connects, for the hard grind 
 That's why I took mine off the top, for the hard time 
 You know you need me in the streets, to help you run things 
 And if you catch a case, you got it wrong, I'mma pawn rings 
 I'm your lady boo, that's what I'm suppose to do 
 I know when you was coppin' my Coupe, that you was coppin' two 
 I know when you got me the red one, that she got the blue 
 But the way I chew on you, you should of got me two 
 Now you got me in the kitchen, with your fryin' on 
 Tell me that you gon' move with me, I know you lyin', dog 
 Who loves you baby? Nobody like Jacki-O 
 Cook, clean, break up your weed, and I give you nasty throat 
 What you actin' for? Get back in the door 
 Come on, home, where you belong, let's get it on 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Yo, you know I always love you, I never meant to hurt you 
 Even the stress'll work you, I miss your old perfume 
 Promise never curse you, I want you in my circle 
 Honey right by my side where I keep my herbals 
 We both agree on no more fighting, we'll just have a verbal 
 The man'll treat you like a queen, I will bird you 
 Mother and father birthed you, if I have to hit you 
 Then damn, I might as well leave, 'cause I don't deserve you 
 Watch from you face, when you sleep, let the heat disturb you 
 Fiendin' from the magic wand, when she 'nique and serve you 
 Take me please, take me with ease 
 Take me back, God damn, and scrape marks on my knees 
 'Member the first time you made my key 
 You was drunk, you went behind a tree and pee'd 
 I miss shit like that, and all of the times 
 We played cops, I'll arrest you in bed 
 Police brutality, I'll leave the side of your ass red 
 God damn it, is sex for real girl? Girl, we in special ed 
 Uh-huh... fuck that, take me back, pretty please, with you on top 
 (Outro: Ghostface Killah) 
 Yeah, yo this goes for everybody all across the world 
 Whether you got fired or your lover dropped you and all that 
 Youknowhatimsayin? Everybody wanna get tooken back 
 Youknowhatimean? Don't be afraid to ask, if you wanna see-- 
 Yo, take me back, fuck it, everybody wanna get tooken back and shit 
 This is your man, Big Ghost, your host, signing off and shit

 Pss... yo, yo, yo (yo son roll!) 
 Oh shit, yo, yo, run! 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Aiyo, I jumped from the 8th floor step, hit the ground 
 The pound fell, cops is coming 
 Runnin' through the pissy stairwells, I ain't hear nothin' 
 Buggin', only thing I remember was the bullshit summon 
 So I stopped at the second floor, ran across, cracks is fallin' 
 My pockets is mean, clean when I vanished off 
 Took off, made track look easy 
 The walkie talkies them D-E-T's had, black, they was rated P.G. 
 Run, I will not give up, no 
 Quick, flag the car down 
 Take me to... Ghost, here they come now! 
 Errr! Peel off quick, back up, hit the bitch, dog 
 Turned downhill, light the Marley spliff 
 Run! I will not get bagged on the rock 
 Run! I seen what happened to Un, they bad with they cops 
 Run! They am' shit, plan shit, destroy evidence 
 Get cassed, I'm not comin' home with no fifty six 
 Die with the heart of Scarface and take fifty licks 
 Before I let these crackers throw me and shit 
 Bounce if you a good kid, bounce, do the bird hop 
 Curse, swerve to get served, these cocksuckers got nerve 
 Heard I was killin' shit, they must got word 
 That I told the chief on Rich Port I don't wanna merge 
 (Chorus: Ghostface Killah) 
 Run! If you sell drugs in the school zone 
 Run! If you gettin' chased with no shoes on 
 Run! Fuck that! Run! Cops got, guns! 
 They givin' out life like bird tons 
 Run! If you ain't do shit, you it 
 That next felony, nigga, it's like three zip 
 So, run! Hop fences, jump over benches! 
 When you see me comin' get the fuck out the entrance! 
 Run! Fuck that! Run! Cops got guns! Motherfucka...

 I like that one (uh-huh, go in, go in!) 
 (Jadakiss) 
 Yo, uh, it's Task Force Tuesday, the NARCS is in the black car 
 I got five hundred, hundred packs in my backyard 
 Clear twelve-twelve's, that look like stuff shells 
 I'm cuttin' niggaz throats on the sails, while they puff L's 
 Don't leave nothin' unbagged, shave everything 
 I learned from the O.G.'s to save everything (to save everything) 
 They come by one more time, they gon' hop out 
 They two deep, and one is a bitch, she gettin' knocked out 
 Then I can get rid of the pack 
 But I just copped this pretty chrome thing, so I'm dippin' with that 
 Uh, down-shiftin' on 'em like I got gears on me 
 (Run!) Besides that, I got about 5 years on me 
 (Run!) Scared to death, runnin' like I got bears on me 
 (Run!) My Timb's start feelin' like they Nike Airs on me 
 (Run!) It's hard for me to slow down, it's like I'm on the throughway 
 My belt's in the crib on the floor by my two-way 
 Now I'm tryin' to hold my hammer up, and my pants too 
 If they don't kill me, they gon' give me a number I can't do 
 Rather it be the streets than jail where I die at 
 And I'm asthmatic, so I'm lookin' for somewhere to hide at 
 But they too close, and I got this new toast 
 'Magine if I would have let off a shot or two, you know what I gotta do"

 First I loved God, then loved my mother 
 Love my babies, sisters and brothers 
 Love my father 'cause that's my mom's partner 
 Love my grandmother and my grouchy assed grandfather 
 Love my aunties on both sides of the family 
 Uncles, cousins, nieces and nepthews 
 Mess with my peoples you get stepped to 
 Love the mother of my children, them girls is special 
 Love feels good though we stuck in the hood 
 Love my last album, though the joint went wood 
 My man's and my enemies, I Love them too 
 Love God he let me see passed 32 
 Plus what he gave Wu 
 I chance to change music just listen, you and I know the truth 
 Love is essential, to some it's detrimental 
 Most of you would've use the next person as a rental 
 (Chorus: Musiq (K. Fox)) 
 Love, lift us up, (higher) take us higher (high) 
 Like every ghetto flower (oh Love yeah) 
 'Cause Love, only Love has the heat and the power 
 And we can never give it up 
 Love, Love, Love 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Love life, the ground we walk on 
 My sickness, it made me strong 
 My loved ones in Heaven 
 The ones we lost, to heroin 
 Malcolm, Martin, and what they still for, the men had it poppin' 
 Love the sun when rain drops in, cosy night with mom punk in 
 Love the hell and my struggle 
 You gotta go through Hell to come out right, Love conquers pain and the puzzle 
 Funny on how Love could end so subtle 
 Was it just sex and not really Love for the couple? 
 Love people, Love the fact when there's a baby bein' born 
 Like ""push girl, come on"" 
 I'm not just sayin' that 'cause BET's on 
 We is one, one Love, each one, teach one

67,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,Struggle,"All my life, it's been one big struggle 
 Born and raised... in the slums of trouble, I'm all... 
 Yo, I was born and raise in New York City 
 The home of the Yankees, the Jam Master Jay's and the Biggie's 
 Ralph Icey's, Jet mags, cops surveillance, it's high tech 
 Our appearance is we still in the grind, and direct 
 But on my side of town shit's gorilla, phone booths is broke 
 Behind the building niggaz on post 
 What up Doc? What up Lord? I'm chilling 
 These motherfuckers got my name and my face 
 Placed up in every building 
 You see what that do to the children, that ain't right 
 I've been raised in these projects, damn near, all my life 
 And these faggots wanna do this to me, I'ma lay low 
 And blow that cop, son, you watch, no lie, word to my momma, dunn 
 They don't want the drama, thunn, 'member me in '86? 
 Knocked out four cops, got knocked on the outer bridge 
 Bagged me with two clips, a fifth of Bacardi Dark 
 I spared them, cause all of them left with they body parts 
 I'm not crazy; I'm lulu, I will Larry Davis these spades 
 You spill a little blood on the NARC's Fubu 
 The Culture Pound'll go through dude, and ricochet off his shoulder 
 Miss the teeth and hit his Lo Mein noodles 
 Fuck it... 
 All my life, it's been one big struggle 
 Born and raised... in the slums of trouble, I'm all... 
 I'ma tell ya motherfuckers something, my struggle is real 
 Threw ketchup on my rice, cause there was no meat with the meal 
 My dog was better off alone, he ate when I ate, if not days later 
 Two weeks old cold shit, straight out the refrigerator 
 Ran away a few times, then boom, went to Dee and fried them 
 Prior to that, burning rulers, we was getting high in the Hill 
 So many cracks we done crushed up in dollar bills 
 It's a shame, didn't smoke once plain; don't pass me that 
 I had escaped that, then dust took over 
 Hit bags of red devil, bundels leaking, had put the hood in a coma 
 Hustling backwards and off balance, turkey and cheese hero's 
 And nutriments, kept a nigga belly full 
 Fresh cut and fresh kicks, thinking it was cool, now I'm telling you 
 A grown man still in the struggle, vouch for my brothers too 
 And sisters, all across the globe, fuck the past 
 Fix the future, I'm sent here to spread the message, come on 
 All my life, it's been one big struggle 
 Born and raised... in the slums of trouble, I'm all..."

 Roll sheets to the icky, chocolate Wonka 
 I'm like the ice cream man, I make the block go bonkers

 A to Z blocks I see Oz for the weed spot 
 Anthony Acid for the party on the roof top 
 Custom made jewels, I got my own spot 
 Like my chain all chunky, and my ladies so lovely

 I liked the way you tilt ya hat up in that Caddy son, 
 Can't believe you the most slept on 
 Took a break since the Cuban, niggas lookin' like you just repped wrong 
 You done slimmed down a bit, got caught with the hammer 
 Steal banners, medical examiners, clocked live hammers 
 For real, you a live nigga, rock ya five in ya slippers 
 Like them other five guys in ya picture 
 Come on, watch, I'm the star of the show, so blow then 
 Mothafucka, you ain't blew in three years 
 You son of a bitch, that's why I rock the big shit 
 Don't forget who you is, nigga, you my little shit 
 I will crush you to pieces, stop ya heart from tickin' 
 And you mad 'cause you a older clock, couple rocks missin' 
 And my Breitling--the band: you can say it's iced lightning 
 You don't like him, do you? You wanna fight him 
 In fact, I should've put you back, relaxed on the stones 
 And copped the two-thousand leather in snow cones 
 A bowl of milk almost killed you, ak, you almost drowned in Pops 
 I bought another box, I'ma keep it real with you 
 And I'ma murder you if ya bitch-ass get on my nerves again

 Good Morning, Good morning 
 Time to get up 
 Look at the sun so pretty today 
 It's so bright, it's so smashing 
 Lasting, helps out the grass and 
 Smile when it's morning time 
 Last night I wrote 3 rhymes, I woke up to see the sun shine 
 If, God is my witness 
 In scriptures and pictures 
 The Sun kiss scrumptious son, it's Nutricious 
 It makes me wanna climb 
 Take a bite out of shine 
 This little light of mine 
 Yo, the son could never be pussy, He always come out 
 He'll sit right there, even if you pull your gun out 
 He can never run out, when the lights go out 
 If your pants turn out, a herb head spun around 
 I see Yellow and Green, It's a beautiful thing 
 The sky's blue, 'cause the sun hit the water like ""BING"" 
 A reflection (uh-huh) and that's all it is (word) 
 You can't stare at him long, 'cause your face'll do like this

 Look what he drew

 He's just as Jolly, He always begging me to let him see you 
 I'm like ""probably if you clean up, and read a little"" 
 You make people eyes glow 
 You got the weather channel bugging and you stubborn when it snow 
 You my mentor, Mothers name their Kids after you 
 New slang, nothing personal, we knowin' what you been through 
 (Sun) You roll like, one in a million yo 
 (Sun Sun) You always find like, one in a building yo 
 We those babies from day one 
 All I had was you on my birthday baby- think you owe me one 
 The way the world look when you around 
 Prisoners get out, look up, run at you and then kiss the ground 
 You my favourite, I wish we had three more of you 
 I adore you, plus I even go to the store for you

 Reachin' a full 98, and got the kids in the pool

 And it's hard to go back to work, when your lunch breaks finished 
 ? Before, so it's a fact I support 
 Feeling the warm sun rays, upon your back as you walk 
 The heat-driven, A theory I plung to deep living is 
 Souls have to go through the sun to reach Heaven 
 And, sensing retreat, our souls badden the scene 
 Madame believe, since dinosaurs, and Adam and Eve 
 That Sun's hovered, to the extermination of us 
 It's a peephole, which leads to the firmament above us

 Look out for Jackson 5-0 'cause they on foot 
 Straight ahead is the doorway, see that lady that lady with the shopping cart 
 She keep a shottie cocked in the hallway 
 Damn she look pretty old Ghost, she work for Kevin, she 'bout seventy seven 
 She paid her dues when she smoked his brother in law at his bosses' wedding 
 Flew to Venezuela quickly when the big fed stepped in 
 3 o'clock, watch the kids, third floor, last door 
 You look paranoid that's why I can't juks with you 
 Why? Why you behind me leery? 
 Shakey Dog stutterin', when you got the bigger cooker on you 
 You is a crazy motherfucker, small Hoodie dude 
 Hilarious move, you on some Curly, Moe, Larry shit 
 Straight parry shit, Krispy Kreme, cocaine, dead bodies, jail time you gon' carry it 
 Matter of fact, all the cash, I'm a carry it 
 Stash it in jelly and break it down at the Marriott 
 This is the spot, yo son your burner cocked? 
 These fuckin' maricons on the couch watchin' Sanford and Son 
 Passin' they rum, fried plantains and rice 
 Big round onions on a T-bone steak, my stomach growling yo I want some 
 Hold on, somebody's comin', get behind me, knocked at the door 
 Act like you stickin' me up, put the joint to my face 
 Push me in quickly when the bitch open up 
 Remember you don't me, blast him if he reach for his gun 
 Yo who goes there? Tony, Tony one second homie 
 No matter rain, sleet or snow you know you suppose to phone me 
 Off came the latch, Frank pushed me into the door 
 The door flew open, dude had his mouth open 
 Frozen, stood still with his heat bulgin' 
 Told him Freeze! lay the fuck down and enjoy the moment 
 Frank snatched his gat, slapped him, axed him 
 Where's the cash, coke and the crack? Get the smoke and you fast 
 His wife stood up speakin' in Spanish, big tittie bitch holdin' the cannon 
 Ran in the kitchen, threw a shot, then kicking the four fifth 
 Broke a bone in her wrist and she dropped the heat 
 Give up the coke! But the bitch wouldn't listen 
 I'm on the floor like holy shit! Watchin my man Frank get busy 
 He zoned out, finished off my man's wiz 
 He let the pitbull out, big head Bruno with the little shark's teeth chargin' 
 Foamin' out the mouth, I'm scared 
 Frank screamin', blowin' shots in the air 
 Missin' his target, off the Frigidare, it grazed my ear 
 Killed that bullshit pit, ran to the bathroom butt first 
 Frank put two holes in the doorman's Sassoon 
 The coke's in the vacuum, got to the bathroom, faced his bad moves 
 The big one had the centipede stab wound 
 Frank shot the skinny dude, laid him out 
 The bigger dude popped Frankie boy, played him out

 Took a fat nigga out in like 40secs 
 My gun get hard wit a 45 still erects and eagle on 
 Kangol hat slanted coconut bounce to Morocco 
 Guerilla medallions like Flavor Flav clock yo 
 Niggaz want me dead but they scared to step to me 
 Rip they guts out like a hysterectomy 
 When beef collide look on the flip by the penitentiary kite 
 Or get you bumped off from the inside

 Bird ass nigga resemble Keenan Ivory Wayans 
 Stay in your place dirt born rappers get Shadow boxed for training?

 Think nobody can; don't give this nigga no statue give him death

 Now why don't you tell these folks why you been ducking me, politics man

 I turned around...

 So so pretty, so pretty - y'all hear how she sounds right? 
 She sounds crazy right? Yes

 She turned around and this grown lady said hi 
 I was quite stunned from the way she replied 
 Peace, nice to meet ya, sweetie call me Tony Starks 
 Ghost if you like ta, mind if invite ya 
 Over for some red wine, nice Barry White huh 
 She pulled out a cigarette, hon here's a lighter 
 Her voice was a slow jam, full length white mink 
 Hella fine with a beauty mark on her right cheek 
 When she spoke her smoke floated when it left her throat 
 Spelled honey when she blew it out it turned to water word 
 I was infatuated 
 She put the perfume to her neck and sprayed it 
 Plus the bottle was nickel plated 
 It make a young girl steez yo feel outdated 
 And know the married chicks shopping with they man's hated 
 One stone on her finger was green, Maybeline 
 Cover Girl lipstick, plump color fingertips 
 Revlon face blush, oh-five-six shit 
 The ashes was hangin' off her stog' so she flicked it 
 Damn, had to bundle up, I call goosebumps 
 Plus the windchill factor had dropped, here the bus come 
 I never rush one, here take my number miss 
 I live alone, her face fell when I dropped the chrome

 Told him it was no cut to be careful, he took a hit, Woodrow damn you 
 His head hit the table, a few rocks fell out his pipe 
 He's bleedin fatal, he smell like it's so ripe 
 Told Trife to get him some ice, Raekwon keep your eye on his wife 
 Tell her to chill, feed her some white

 Come home and still blow cats for me 
 Pump crack, stabbin all them hoodrat shorties

 Take me across her lap, she used to whip me with a strap 
 When I was bad 
 Bad 
 Picture me snotty nose sittin' on my aunt's lap 
 The kid like 5 or 6 shit I will curse back 
 I got it from the older folks sittin' in the living room 
 Everybody had cups stylistic song boom 
 But then came Darryl Mack lightin' all the reefer up 
 Baby caught a contact I'm trying to tie my sneaker up 
 I'm missing all the loops strings going in the wrong holes 
 It feels like I'm wobbling, look at all these afros 
 Soon as I thought I was good the joke's on me 
 I heard a voice ""get in the room, I get angry"" 
 Sting my feet catch a tantrum 
 Spit, scream, fuck that 
 Momma shake me real hard, then get the big gat 
 That's called the belt help me as I yelled 
 I'm in the room like (panting)""huh, huh, huh"" with mad welps 
 Ragged out, bad belt yes her presence was felt 
 Then get my black ass in the bed it's time crash out (crash out) 
 Despite the alcohol, I had a great old Mama 
 She famous for her slaps and to this day she's honored 
 But when I was a lil dude her son was a lil rude 
 I picked the peas off my plate and pour juice in her nigga food 
 Get beat, then I'd run and tell grandman ""mama hit me for no reason"" 
 She whipped me hard when I finished eatin 
 And felt that belt stingin after I wet that bed 
 Hid my drawers and start cryin, when she felt that bed 
 Caught another when I told her those the fake pro-keds 
 In the corner weavin and screamin trying to block my head (ah!) 
 Nowadays kids don't get beat, they get big treats 
 Fresh pair of sneaks, punishments like have a ceas 
 Back then when friends and neighbors would bust that ass 
 And bring you back to your momma she got the switch in the stash 
 That's back to back beatings 
 Only went outside for free lunch with welts on my legs still leakin yo"

 Aiyo, I should just bark on you, burn your car on you 
 'Cause I'm too much man, to leave a mark on you 
 You'se a bird you know that, giving that man 
 Ten points, like he about to blow that 
 He probably did, you swallow his kids? 
 In and out of jail, he a snail, he wasn't wilding on bids 
 In the summertime, I broke his jaw, had to do it, to him 
 Quick, old fashion, in the back of the mall 
 Me and him had 'mos forever, like I'm supposed to put him on 
 When he came home and told on Trevor 
 Had to bang on homey, ear blocks, out in spots 
 Throwing them shots, like 'sucker, you know me' 
 Stop fronting for them people out, side like you really ride 
 And you a silly chick, thought you was really live 
 But I guess I was wrong, I'mma holla at dog 
 And rip his head off, words of a song 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Aiyo, I thought we was iller than that, all them kisses 
 And love yous, when jake came, you hid my packs 
 It was time a brother went to war, vests banged up 
 Staining in the kitchen, yo, holding a four 
 Sweatin' and breathing, bounced out of town for a weekend 
 Heard you had homey in the passenger seating 
 Honey, look, I'm a monster don, I do monster things 
 That's why I put your ass under my arm 
 Messing with him can bring bodily harm 
 And where you gonna hide in the streets when the body is gone 
 If it's one thing I learned that, never trust a female 
 On no scale, you just confirmed that 
 Bounce to your momma house, pack your shit 
 I don't care if you crying, you'se a ruthless chick 
 Gots to watch you, these eyeballs in my face'll spot you 
 My girl cousins, they gon' rock you 
 (Ne-Yo) 
 Shorty what is you thinking bout 
 Didn't I put you down 
 Flyest whips, rollin' round like yeah 
 That's the bosses chick, on the side 
 I might of had, one or two 
 Them silly broads wasn't nothing on you 
 Rolling with him, try'nna get revenge 
 That's what you just don't do 
 (Chorus to fade) 
 (Outro: Ghostface Killah) 
 I'm a good dude, you see... yeah... 
 Females out there that wanna be 
 Acting like they getting they little revenge off 
 Taking it further than what it really is 
 You know what I mean, playing yourself... 
 Nahwhatimean... this is Don status, girl 
 You will have to hold that now..."

 Straight up! Sipping on that bullshit Budweiser! 
 Nah'mean yo... what? Fuck you too nigga! 
 'Kind of pants you got on motherfucker, Capris?! 
 Bitch ass nigga, go get ya feet done! 
 Eat a dick nigga! 
 Catch me in the 80's drop 
 Old school Mercedes with a brand new baby glock 
 Right from my Lady's sock with two bodies on it 
 Capricorn, Aquarius 
 Lost so much blood, these bitch niggaz in they periods 
 They say I be living the role, like 'Pac in Juice 
 And only fuck with fly bitches that get fly and boost 
 And they ears be chandelliers, lit up like a lamp, Who cares?! 
 They cooch is fierce, the only thing loose is hairs 
 That's right y'all, if a rap nigga say my name I'm a fight y'all 
 Fuck a state, light charge 
 My predicate status, irrelevant 
 My man got the big rap sheet that's outweighing two elephants 
 Jumbo shits from New Orleans 
 Players and Pimps that bit off Fiends 
 Quick, switch with the hands, Powder blue wally's is dyed, Vanilla bally's is mean 
 Kid, none of y'all motherfuckers fuck with my team, Uh! 
 (Chorus: Trife Da God) 
 Aiyyo we the live niggaz holdin' heat on the street corners 
 Sic the beasts on you, turning mothers to morners 
 Money launderers, neighborhood coroners, place bodies in bags 
 Tango with dirty Cash, Cocaine jacks 
 ""Kings of the Hill"", out to blow like propane gas 
 Package the raw, Theodore, We got the game on smash 
 'Cause we cut from the same cloth 
 Big guns ready to bang off 
 Slide off the cables and take the rings off! 
 We hold the weight of four Synagogues 
 Jelly'd uptown in them beat down rented cars 
 Going mad wetting 'em 
 Milk cash, heavy tecks, hood rats, sexin 'em 
 Paris crew, little dudes, please!, I was reppin 'em 
 Niggaz couldn't come through (word) 
 That's when the block was like wallpaper, loved sticking niggaz like crazy glue 
 Blackouts happened, God forbid don't be around! 
 The Bag Lady will murk you and let off in the next town! 
 She struck two times, get caught, good luck blood, it ain't no heines 
 Blow a hockey puck hole in the back of your spine 
 She put two cut up mirrors in the place of your eyes 
 So when the cops look they see theyselves, they all gonna die 
 It's the tale of the crips and bloods, pimps and thugs 
 Get your face bashed in on the concrete rug 
 On that note I'm a say peace! 
 Theodore! Word to Darryl Mack's teeth! 
 Yo, Ayo I'll break every bone in your wrist 
 Smack you in the back of your head on the block while you holding your dick 
 My semi, they call it the crouching tiger 
 A hundred bowls of Total is trash, because my lead eat through fibers 
 Peel your potato like Arriada 
 On the day of your death people had candles but couldn't find no lighter 
 Fuck your marrow! fuck your hood! 
 You ain't a street legend like me! 
 Blake Carrington holding the Dynasty 
 I muffle motherfuckers up like meineke 
 And write a thousand bar verse that all rhymes with ""eat"" 
 Jewel thief, Shizzam bangles, in the vault deep 
 And cruisin desserts mad heavy into salt treats 
 I'm the taste in Bush's mouth, nasty 
 Afghanistan missions, gun training in the grassy fatigues 
 Picking niggaz off by the Red Sea 
 And did it all for Ghost, sniffin on caffeine!"

 Aiyyo 
 Here's a little story ghetto situation 
 'Bout a girl I met who had many temptations 
 She was so fly, get high, well understood 
 Big-ass big brains and straight out the hood 
 (Ghostface) 
 Yo, 
 Aiyyo, I woke up early took a stretch and a yawn 
 Had a 2 o'clock appointment with this girl name Dawn 
 She ain't the Avon lady but her beauty was strong 
 Right before she went to rest she had me singin' this song 
 She must be a special lady 
 And a very exciting girlllllllllll 
 I don't know 
 She had the high-glow's switchin 
 See her in the club you hear others chicks bitchin 
 But Dawn quit to bust a bitch ass and shit 
 See she did 12 months over a ratchet 
 Not no crab shit 
 Got bagged with the mag 
 Taxi cab shit 
 Clit was hangin' out her panties with no where to stash it 
 It was classic 
 Nowadays she's laid back 
 Helpin me perfect my rap 
 Only pink and smoked salmon where she feed her cat 
 Wife everything 
 Diamond cut like johnny lex collar attached 
 Lickin' glass bowls in her cat clothes 
 Cause crazy stacks 
 Finicky thing 
 Her kittin drink pollar spring 
 Take naps 
 Near her jewerly box 
 She play with all the rings 
 And when she step out the tub it's like an ill flick 
 Carmel skin, bath and body works leave the whole room lit 
 Cinnamon candles, sweet side, they on relax mode 
 Paint her toes on the bed slow, watchin me 
 Versace robe on her body, peak, sippin asti (piemonte) 
 She a perfect 10 in my wildest dreams DAWN 
 (Cappadonna) 
 Aiyyo, she gotta be gone 
 Waitin on my sweet strawbeery pecan rican LaShawn 
 Holdin' my taffy down when I'm gone 
 Three fourths of her body always covered with clothes 
 That's why I'm eatin her candy 
 And suckin her toes 
 Sweet sexy LaShawn 
 She got body like what's goin' on 
 On some marvin gay shit like let's get it onnnnn 
 Suuuugarrrr 
 Letssss getttt it onnnnn 
 Ayo she a diamond in the rough 
 Black rose in the hood 
 I love my queen and she treat me good 
 Fuck cookin for me 
 She stash me out when the feds come lookin' for me 
 I'm not cheatin' on her or beatin' on her 
 I spend the weekend on her 
 We on the block when the bills start creepin' on her 
 She right there when it gets sticky 
 She strict politic to the vicky's 
 And a fly aviator the color of sky 
 God on her side 
 Indian chick with cat eyes 
 Mad respect with the fat thighs 
 Plus her guns for the revolution 
 Would straight leave her if she prostituting 
 Yo my girls the bomb 
 Intelligent mind 
 Sky blue louis vetton 
 Leg muscles, deep dimples 
 Body is soft she smell fresh like a new born 
 Pretty feet peitete ass nice shoes on 
 The sunshine for my quiet storm 
 Keepin' the food warm while I'm gone 
 It won't be long till I'm back to my sweet butter pecan rican LaShawn 
 Hit me up baby, P.S. Cappadon' 
 (Trife) 
 Aiyyo, aiyyo I woke up in the morning still drunk off the Henn 
 Had a 3'oclock appointment with this girl name Jen 
 You know Jen from a hundred and ten, she push the Lex Coupe 
 Part time fashion designer she work for Jet Blue 
 Pretty young thing, with a body like vida 
 Ass off the meter, eva medenez look, strut like a diva 
 Leave her shine fine, blow minds like dimes of a cheeba 
 She like it from behind, slow grind, sometimes with her feet up 
 Ms. Bonitta Applebum Bottom, thick as a Roman column 
 Raw dick it down, love me, even if I'm holdin' condoms! 
 'Cause she my bitch, the only cat that I lick 
 Throwin' that ass like Ciara on the top of that whip 
 Latin decent, velour suit with the cameltoe print 
 Peppermint flared panties with the garder-belt clips 
 Tattoo of a small butterfly on her inner thigh 
 Even at my loneliest times you that Jen will ride... 
 (Chorus - Trife) 
 Whether Jen, Don, or Shawn it's the same situation 
 'Bout a girl I met who had many temptations 
 She was so fly, get high, well understood 
 Big-ass big brains and straight out the hood"

 Just keep away (just keep away 
 Go on, it's not your fight!) 
 It's not yours nigga, fall back 
 I'm about to blow something out here 
 Straight up, yeah, this is a family thing 
 We gon' handle our business and shit 
 These muthafuckas know not to come around here like that 
 This is real shit, real talk 
 Four different niggaz with four different aspects, nigga 
 This is family shit 
 Who the fuck said family ain't family no more, nigga? 
 This is tight shit, tighter than white in ya wallet 
 (Verse 1 - Ghostface Killah) 
 Yo, I'm talking heavy bags of coke, bracelets on every men 
 Innocent dope pushers, overnight kingpins 
 Indeed, we smack niggaz up for the cheese 
 Throw bleach in ya face. Got beef? Let it be chuck 
 The streets don't know my peeps 
 Jumpin' out of UPS trucks, blowing niggaz off they feet 
 With four-four gloves, rims spinnin,' tippin' on fo-fo's 
 My mouth be worth millions, something like Paul Wall's 
 Ladies look out; they ain't thugs, they homo's 
 The film look hyper, when I clap 'em in slo mo' 
 Y'all still paying the mob? We whip niggaz out like waffle batter 
 Theodore ancient with dart, flossin' them diamonds 
 Discussing our hits over a glass of scotch 
 Baywatch bitches that ski, take turns when they hand us the twat 
 Think not, we still run the trains, till the condom pop 
 On the low, we still fucking them cops 
 Pretty things from all precincts 
 Friday nights, we holding they Glocks 
 This is family, nigga. Niggaz can't stand me 
 Next up, my little man, I hand you the jammy 
 (Sun God) 
 You know the fam, what it is, it is what it is 
 S.I.N.Y., where the animals live 
 Aspect niggaz run in yo cribs 
 I don't care if you blast for the cash, then scramble yo wig 
 I'm like damn, what a wonderful kid 
 I could do what I want, doing dirt, not serving a bid 
 You know a real fam handle they biz, everybody get searched 
 From the grandpops down to the kids 
 And my time, I'm officially here 
 Tell ya man go and start up ya car, start shiftin' the gears 
 Sun God got the pits for his hairs 'cause niggaz is scared 
 Hopin' I don't let it blow in they ribs 
 I said hot, niggaz get robbed nonstop 
 Once the gun cock, niggaz strip down to they socks 
 And my fam at the tippity top, I won't stop 
 Believe it or not, you and ya man is close targets 
 Juks everything, dice games, mini markets 
 Fam gon' spark it 
 I'mma take whatever's in the pockets, mostly the cash and the wallet 
 Slide off the jewels 'cause you shinin,' begets and the diamonds 
 Never deny niggaz with iron (Yo) 
 (Raekwon) 
 Ay yo, chillin' with the Caesar crew 
 We can smoke, all in the halls 
 It's how many niggaz with guns, got 'em on 
 All tip top, cling to the fullest, mad bullets 
 This is a hobby, the lobby where they clap yo hoods 
 Get the paper, word to everything, we a acre up 
 Barbequein' like a mutt, we ain't taking nothing 
 A high tech extremist, Gatorade, paid ya boy some money 
 To lay up on the low, swinging beamers 
 I need to be an actor, but instead, I'd rather be in Hempstead 
 All of my bread came from crack barbers and shoppers 
 So much beef in these whoppers 
 Guns that'll knock out floors and hit choppers 
 What? What? The family remains, 'cause it's grain 
 It's automatic, I live it and I claim it's real 
 Come around here, you bow here 
 Yo, lay that half tape, then you will get wrapped real quick 
 (Trife Da God) 
 Ay yo, we hug the block on President's Day 
 Swinging all year round, gettin' that money the American way 
 Might run up in yo wedding, grab the reverend and spray 
 And let the shots for whatever they may 
 This is family, nigga, minus the mob size 
 The resurrection of Tony Starks ""Trife Dies', starring in Part 5 
 Niggaz'd rather die when they pride's in question 
 Tryin' to play hero, gettin' stuck for they prized possessions 
 Look you staring in the eyes of oppression, that's why I ride with protection 
 Extended clips, super sizing my weapons 
 Five eleven, keep the heat tucked 
 That'll burn a hole through ya stomach like acid reflux 
 Get buried in ya cheap tux' 
 We make it hard for you niggaz to keep up 
 Been through a hundred towns, and running, beating the streets up 
 From up north in New York, down in Miami 
 Pumping at the table, breaking bread like a family 
 (Cappadonna) 
 Florida, where we follow the code of the streets in 
 Breakin' the beats in 
 We takin' the East, never the least 
 We invading the streets, shaking the beast 
 We 
 familia 
 for life 
 We don't run, we grab knives 
 My double-edged spit life 
 My dogs is real tight, shootin' the dice 
 Some of my fam might snatch ya ice 
 Got family that go to church, come back like ""it don't work"" 
 Got family that'll set you up 
 Got family that'll chill, wanna spark the dutch 
 Wizard my fam, that stuck you up 
 I got fam that'll fuck you up 
 Chop you up, put your body in the back of the truck 
 Osama Island, you been whilin,' see the violence 
 We display talent, respect balance

 I'll play to the sucker DJ, lookin' like Enrique 
 Told him to throw in that Supreme Cliee-ente 
 He said just gave a nod with a thumbs up wink 
 I just put down my dollar bill, took off my mink 
 Bartenders know me big spenders, gave us those monster drinks 
 Sent us lobsters and cigars that stink

 Noses runnin' from the raw, they hid behind they glasses

 Stay focused, take care of your health 
 Have kids and marry a prince 
 Good luck and happiness 
 And no longer shut yourself in, taste the pain, the sorrow 
 The sun'll shine and still come out tomorrow 
 And maybe be a secretary, business woman, 5th Ave., or run a library

 Yo 
 Aiyyo I'm lost underwater 
 I see a pink dog with a crystal handle, so I keep swimmin 
 Amazed that I'm not drownin 
 Butterflies took control when I arrived, I opened the door 
 No I knocked first, I'm not on my turf 
 I seen a ray of lights that resemble live fireworks 
 Some mermaids with Halle Berry haircuts flashin they tail 
 Like follow me now, don't be afraid 
 I'ma show you where all the djinns and spirits pray 
 If you scared to face this life you shouldn't stay 
 So I kept on swimmin, grabbed on to her fin to help me out 
 As we got close I seen the boat all shot up with his anchor out 
 Then she asked me politely what I'm thinkin' about 
 I said nuttin - she said nuttin leaves nuttin 
 If you fill me up bet this'll bring that out 
 I seen rubies, diamonds, smothered under octopus 
 Jellyfish sharks soar, aquaproof pocketbook 
 Pearls on the mermaid girls 
 Gucci belts that they rock for no reason from a different world 
 Up ahead lies Noah's Ark, but that's waves away 
 And way to the right, that's one of our bangin' spas 
 She quoted I took notice, Spongebob in the Bentley Coupe 
 Bangin' the Isleys, he slow backed up 
 Then he passed me swoop, seen his chick eyein me hard 
 He got vexed and smacked his boo 
 Took off, continued my travels 
 Seen a rock from the Titanic 
 Lookin' fat and nah it wasn't damaged 
 Then I seen somethin' real big, sky blue and gold 
 With whitewalls, behind a large city 
 That was lost before Christ walked the walk 
 Upon the waters that's so bright 
 Everytime we got close the mermaid held on tight 
 All I heard was ""Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar"" 
 ""Bismillah ar-Rahman, ar-Raheem, Allah screamed"" 
 That we heard from afar, everyone selat 
 And the world's banginest minds got crowded in 
 With life that I can't explain 
 They said sir yes I'm glad you came, greeted me with Qu'rans and Torahs 
 Prayed after that we said amen"

 Then I'mah tell you mine 
 Tell 'em 
 (Chorus: Megan Rochell) 
 Hustlin, strivin, strugglin survivin (Momma, momma) 
 Never realizing, that you were a diamond (momma, momma) 
 Through the sun, or the rain, through the pain I'ma hold you down (hold you down) 
 Through the good, or the bad times (I got love for you) 
 The stress and the heart aches (so much love for you) 
 (Ghostface) 
 It's not ya momma fault 
 It's ya fathers fault 
 It's your fathers fault your mother is an alcoholic 
 Confusin the brain from the booze and the pain 
 And plus he cheated on her, beated on her, smack dead in the rain 
 She Lost her first child in 74 
 And that lead to nervous breakdowns bicardi dark she downin it raw 
 She can't take it she constantly cryin fallin' down on her knees 
 Like help me lord please I'm ready to leave 
 All she needed was somebody to rub her feet 
 Give her a nice hug and rescue her from off these streets 
 (Ghostface) 
 I been sent by an angel to snatch you up 
 Take you way above the clouds and back you up 
 At night you can lay in my arms feel the heart beatin' 
 Don status in the sheets I'm keepin' you warm 
 Ain't no nigga gone do what I do 
 Imah take care of you and ya kids 
 Take the bent and go handle ya biz 
 The bills is paid, the cable back on 
 I quote you know the seeds want they nickleodeon on 
 I'm not ashamed to sport you 
 Floss you or gloss you out 
 Fat, skinny out of shape I'll dior you out 
 (Ghostface) 
 In the hood there's a struggle 
 My girls is in trouble 
 She lackin guidance in the mind she's blinded and puzzled 
 Her pops never showed her the ropes 
 Her moms raised mad kids on her own 
 She never had a strong man in her home 
 (Meagan Rochell) 
 Nothing in this life, sun don't always shine 
 But it can't rain all the time (everything gone be all right) 
 Somebody sees your pain 
 You will never hurt again 
 I see you momma 
 I see you momma 
 You can cry yours eyes (cry your eyes) 
 It will be all right (it will be all right)"

 We run the city 
 (Notorious B.I.G.) 
 Today's agenda, got the suitcase up in the Sentra 
 Go to room 112, tell 'em Blanco sent ya 
 Feel the strangest, if no money exchanges 
 I got these kids in Ranges, to leave them niggaz brainless 
 All they tote is stainless, you just remain as 
 Calm as possible, make the deal go through 
 If not, here's 12 shots, we know how you do 
 Please make yo' killings clean, slugs up in between 
 They eyes, like ""True Lies,"" kill 'em and flee the scene 
 Just bring back the coke or the cream 
 Or else, your life is on the shelf, we mean this Frank 
 Them cats we fuckin' with put bombs in your mom's gas tank 
 Let's get this money baby, they shady, we get shady 
 Dress up like ladies and burn 'em with dirty 380's 
 Then they come to kill our babies, that's all out 
 I got gats that blow the wall out, clear the mall out 
 Fuck the fallout, word to Stretch I bet they pussy 
 The seven digits push me, fuckin' real, here's the deal 
 I got a hundred bricks, fourteen-five apiece (uh-huh) 
 Enough to cop a six; buy the house on the beach (uh-huh) 
 Supply the peeps with Jeeps, brick apiece, capiche? 
 Everybody gettin' cream no one considered them leech 
 Think about it now that's damn near one-point-five 
 I kill 'em all I'll be set for life, Frank pay attention 
 These motherfuckers is henchmen, renegades 
 If you die they still get paid, extra probably 
 Fuck a robbery, I'm the boss 
 Promise you won't rob 'em, I promise 
 But of course you know I had my fingers crossed 
 (Chorus: Raekwon) 
 Niggaz got to die, if I go they got to go 
 Niggaz got to die, let a hundred shots float 
 Niggaz got to die, 'cause it's all up in the scrolls 
 Catch a body on the bridge, three bricks, live kid 
 ... If I go they got to go 
 Niggaz got to die, let a hundred shots float 
 Niggaz got to die, 'cause it's all up in the scrolls 
 Catch a body on the bridge, three bricks, live kid 
 (Raekwon) 
 We up in the lab, two Spanish, one Arab lady 
 Layin on the bed, lookin' like a drag 
 Had the pillow cuffed, lookin' at me and Frank, her grill was rough 
 Who woulda ever think she'd rather do us up 
 But that's the business, back to the sitch 
 On these Puerto Rican kids with pistols 
 Doin' sign language is twitchin noses 
 Ask 'em where the money at, yo where the coke at papi? 
 We can do this all day, yo y'all both whack 
 They pulled out, one of my dunn soldiers was wombed out 
 They snuck up on him, put the tool up in his mouth 
 Walked them up in crib, big move, but they grabbed the kid 
 Had the shotty on my beehive, my wig 
 And yo they took me to the bathroom, started up the chainsaw yo 
 You gon' talk or see your brains on the floor 
 That's when 6 to 7 masked men, came in blastin yo 
 All I heard was Frank Lexi get the raw 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Bleed just like us, believe my pipe bust 
 If he holdin' the right amount of cheese I might rush the spot 
 Up early in the mornin, kick the door in, wave the 4 an' 
 (Fuck) the brawlin, cause Tony for the stallin 
 And all I see is $ signs, here's the bottom line either 
 Give up the product or get shot up with a brolic 9 
 Invest figures to address (niggaz) 
 Workin out, all I curl is my index finger 
 Got a safe that hold more notes than Cortex singers 
 My work is move trays, serve 'em up like gourmet dinners 
 When it comes to cuttin' that (coke), who got the best trimmers 
 Edward Scissorhands them grams, (niggaz) respect winners 
 I got them big spenders comin' through, hourly 
 Competition, we knock 'em out the box, powerfully 
 Still drop a ill verse, on the D.I., me 
 You might be gone, but the legacy is B.I.G., nigga 
 Uh-huh 
 (Raekwon) 
 Yo I think they tryin' to do somethin' man 
 I don't know what it is but we gon' go in there handle this business man

 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Yo, yo I was sitting at the table thinking 
 How the hell do I murder these M.C.'s, sting 'em like bees 
 My attitude's that of Hannibal, not compatible 
 Why I would damage you, fuck, if I drink, then ran with you 
 Y'all chose to war, so called rich niggaz wanna verse the poor 
 I'll rob you first, then go to your earth, it's not gon' hurt 
 If you try calling the cops, it's not gon' work 
 All you gotta do is lay in the dirt, we dug a hole 
 And my guns weight more, yo, then Gerald Levert 
 With more blubber than a Ruben Studdard, I grease the pan 
 With rhymes, and y'all can't believe it's not butter 
 I told y'all to chill, stretch all out like franks on the grill 
 With a classic deal, I'm like a farmer when I'm playing the field 
 Just painting my seeds, in 20-06, it's time to build 
 ""Ghost is back..."" - [sample 4X] 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Yo, I cooked up the beef, seasoned up the meat 
 Fried 'em, tried 'em, took it out the grease 
 Ghost came to steal the show, since you loving your broad 
 I'ma lay back and reveal your hoe 
 She a brain therapist, chick you can't kiss 
 Opened up her legs, like ""ooh, I smell fish"" 
 Yeast infection, queen, she love dick 
 Shivlered up tits, she'll bang the whole Knicks 
 Now how can I salute you, kid, I'm planning to do you 
 Crucial, blow rugers at who you with 
 We bump heads while we out in the street, it's all good 
 My trigger fingers'll matter, kick the back of your feet 
 And your red monkey jeans, is looking like a scene from Baghdad 
 That's bad, flags red, dirt beds 
 Y'all niggaz is eating, crystal meth' heads 
 We pissed out, wrist out, with the best threads 
 Knockin' niggaz off, knockin' niggaz out 
 Fucking up rappers is what I'm about 
 I'm holding Staten Island down, y'all cats must be dead 
 Keep fronting and lose your head 
 ""Ghost is back..."" - [sample 4X]

 You can decide on who's liver 
 Toney Knight Rider, wisdoms love my saliva 
 Slobbin' 'em down, hoggin' the mound 
 Pitchin' 'em eightballs, robbing the town 
 Don't let your gangsta, get you murked up 
 Faggot ass homeys done got you worked up 
 Rappers can't come around, y'all wide rap is dead 
 Freeze, nigga, come off the bread 
 Whole horizon, hit 'em with toast, a rap arising 
 Ringing the boys bell like Verizon 
 Eyes, looking surprised, that the four-five 
 Yo Ghost, don't even do it, I got some more pie

93,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,Miguel Sanchez,"(Trife Da God) 
 Uh, thirty thousand feet up in the air, up in the lear 
 Dressed in a black tux, forty cal. tucked, strapped to the chair 
 Half asleep, hopping out of my seat, caught in the daze 
 Turned around and seen a white man's face, covered in shades 
 I must of passed out, can't remember shit before I blacked out 
 Three more niggas approaching, holding they mack's out 
 One spoke, gave me the keys, to a boat 
 Reached in his trenchcoat, and pulled out a yellow envelope 
 Which contained twenty thousand in cash, a photograph 
 Of a Colombian nigga with a long mustache 
 Miguel Sanchez, keep a gun hidden in his pants leg 
 With armed bodyguards, surveillance around his land spread 
 He runs a billion dollar organization, under investigation 
 Plus he's wanted by immigration 
 Now I'm stuck, crazy look on my face, shocked in amazement 
 How the fuck I get involved with these federal agents 
 They knew my background, knew about what happened down in Sac Town 
 They knew about the wrap down south, they laid they backs down 
 Said I had two decisions, take out Miguel and his cartel 
 Or spend the rest of my life in prison 
 A classified mission on some James Bond shit 
 007 style, love to get some straight convicts 
 Now I'm pondering, my thoughts wandering, got my girl on the phone 
 Told her to kiss little Jay 'cause I'll be gone again 
 Honey, I can't sleep, she sucking her teeth 
 If everything go good, baby, I'll be home in a week 
 Pinching myself just to see if I'm dreaming, call up my team and 
 Meet me by the docks in Miami, I'll fly out this weekend 
 (Sun God) 
 I got you nigga, four-four pop two niggas 
 That drug lord that we want, got a spot for niggas 
 And if we kill 'em, it's back to the block, my nigga 
 He carried rugers, thirty four shots I figure 
 He only holla at the kid, when there's money involved 
 They pack shotguns, hollow tips, dummies and all 
 When me and Trife doing right together, got no choice 
 But give us ten, like we selling white together 
 Left side, four-five, right, black beretta 
 Taking trips over seas, flipping packs for better 
 Every flight a hundred stacks and better, so grind hard 
 Get ya money up, get on your grillies, don't mind odds 
 Fuck a cop car, throw on some chumpers, and drop charge 
 Hit the block hard, it's kinda hard being G-O-D 
 If he owe Trife, he owe me 
 Load up the mack grounds, M-I-A, call that the jack town 
 Tell niggas I'm on my way, coming back down 
 Miguel, Mr. Sanchez, it's a wrap, now 
 Theodore extorting your shit, handing out packs, now 
 I used to listen to 50 and jam ""Back Down"" 
 Now I slang fifty kilo's where I'm at now 
 Fifty a wop, purple top, nigga, I'm back, clown 
 Crystal bottles, Grey Goose for the chat lounge 
 Channel seven news, older dude, murder gat found"

 They picked the car up, they on some Flintstone shit 
 Oh shit... and them niggaz stuck together 
 On some Siamese shit... yo 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Yo, classic murders, slick gun material 
 Burnt up bodies that rock with no burial 
 Hammers that hardly work, go to work 
 Like a slave on a hot day, with no water 
 Blow you for props, in the cop's face, might get knocked up 
 Jakes that play hero, they can get popped up 
 Face fallin' off they cheekbone, gotta take meat 
 From they ass, to sow it back, I'm a beast, holmes 
 It's ground beef, in the streets, so we street's clone 
 Like fresh fruit, from a tree, so the heat's blown 
 Your momma missing, your boys are crying 
 Cut ya balls out your nutsack, the chinks are buying 
 Shit bags is like gift bags, you get it for free 
 If you master fronting, classic cutting 
 You keep stunting, them gem star'll rip something 
 Look homey, it's the bloody sweepstakes 
 Glove club you down in the club, how you like that, sweet cakes? 
 (Trife Da God) 
 Yo, it was a minute after twelve, when the tragedy struck 
 Niggaz emptied on son, and left 'em leaning right in Valerie's truck 
 The red Cherokee blood was pouring out his head heavily 
 The only motive for murder was wetter, either jealousy 
 The found him slumped over the wheel, horn blowing 
 Bullet holes showing, property stolen, motor still going 
 Driving side door, waves scoping, the window is broken 
 Glass back and shredded his grill, his collar was soaking 
 He probably knew the killas, 'cause they jinxed him with ease 
 Cops hold the perimeter, thirsty, looking for leads 
 Knocking on doors, questioning tenants, the lieutenant 
 Was the first to arrive on the scene, he knew he was finished 
 DeWayne Roberts knew him in college, mid-twenties 
 Stopped being brolic, V.A. driver's license in his wallet 
 The last call on his mobile phone was back to home 
 Sorry, Miss Amonia's son was found dead with two in his dome 
 (Cappadonna) 
 This be the bird's eye view of things, look how we doing things 
 We stick niggaz up and we take they rings 
 Mission Impossible, Theodore Unit, we unstoppable 
 Spit razors out of our mouth and start chopping you 
 Bank robbers, blood jakes out with the obstacle 
 Ropes hanging down from the roof, my parachute 
 Soaking water, heat smoking, we scrape and we Pillage, man 
 Wherever we broke in, Theodore, pulverize 
 Boat rides and tours, smashed 'em in the crib with they coconut straws 
 Dudes step off the scene, black face and four-four 
 The CREAM that we stack up, cake and whores 
 (Killa Sin) 
 Cash in abundance, the cats that I run with 
 Got gats at a motel, and splashed by the hundreds 
 I don't ask if I want it, my attitude is running 
 I don't ask if I want it, my attitude is running, yup 
 Mega ice neck, with some fish, with some fish dishes 
 Rakim gems, my mind shine is what my weight misses 
 Anything else is uncivilized, send the kind of niggaz 
 A tremendous spy, you can see the venom by 
 My nine leave a ten to buy, I don't need my men to ride 
 I'm in the moshing squad, beside the car that's highly energized 
 Been advised, before, that fucking with I, is genocide 
 Many men have died, from playing games from what they feel inside 
 Brawl with it in me, put it on my enemy 
 Be warned, defending me, like killing off a Kennedy 
 I silly song M.C.'s get sent on base 
 Type of nigga spit the Remy or laugh in ya face 
 This dig in my waste, is mastery, step out of place 
 Shatter that ass, like glass, and break fast like a neglige 
 Play with the biscuit, dick, don't even risk it 
 I, snatch up my misses, and dash on the interstate"
95,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,Outta Town Shit,"I'm six foot two and a half 
 With shoes on make it three even 
 Been shot but I'm still breathing 
 Sent niggaz back to Pittsburgh 
 With they necks wrapped up no lie 
 See that's what happens when slugs fly 
 Doves cry when a thug dies 
 It might rain if you're a love guy 
 Glocks we tote 'em in belong pawn shops where we resold 'em 
 And going in we let the fiends hold 'em 
 Fake aliases, no driver's license or socials 
 But we cold cheek shit, so many hammers left the clerk speechless 
 Outdoors my niggaz is dirty 
 Rollin' smoke in the back seat sippin' orange juice 
 Bumping Blackstreet, suede wallets, Wallabees 
 Pea soup Clarks, music blastin', laughin' with the whip in park 
 Bodies for lunch, they eat those 
 Old school guns is like old albums, clean 'em and they keep goin' 
 Hey man it's rough outside 
 Crack heads is buyin' all night 
 Handguns is necessary 
 Fuck around you might lose your life 
 Anywhere in and outta town B 
 The same every hood it's so real 
 That you gotta be on your grizzly 
 If not then you might get pideeled 
 Like one day right over a powerful dice game in Minnesota 
 We hit the mall up for kicks 
 Slid, in other words bounce, tip the chauffeur 
 To get that cheddar cheese back we lost from earlier 
 Get back the dices shaking, stretching my arm like Troy Aikman 
 What's in the bank? Nigga what? Twelve grand bowl 'em 
 No little shit on the floor roll 'em 
 That's what I do (sounds of dice shaking) 
 Six 'em girls, hit his kicks 
 I'm a still show that motherfucker he fish 
 Pound cake, beat that bitch 
 Holy smoke! I admire your roll 
 Two fours and a five, they all applause and he smiled 
 But confident me, yeah I threw my twelve on the ground 
 Grab the dice, blew on 'em 
 Passed off the other thirty five thou, I'm doin' 'em 
 Nigga move shoot 'em, what's that? You roll a five? 
 Twenty or better y'all, I'm taking all side bets! Everybody spread out! 
 Watch the magic number that my pretty hand let out 
 My first roll was one two four, picked 'em up 
 Somebody screamed out, ""Tony Starks headed for the dust off!"" 
 I'm like hell no I'm headed for the gun store 
 Punch you in your motherfuckin' face like Spongebob 
 Watched his face when he aced, the place got quiet 
 Bowled like twenty forty times, my arm got tired 
 Couldn't hit a point, not even a deuce 
 Took a swig of my man's goose 
 Anything just to give me a damn boost 
 Then out came a wonderful six 
 Holy shit! Stack that shit 
 Yo Trife Dies snatch that fuckin' cream quick 
 That was one one six, one sixteen point C 
 And I don't care about no motherfuckin' Royce Green 
 He pulled out, he pointed at me, I pointed at him 
 My main man pointed at them 
 They pulled their guns out and pointed at him 
 And crazy shells they was coming in 
 Hey man it's rough outside 
 Crack heads is buyin' all night 
 Handguns is necessary 
 Fuck around you might lose your life 
 Anywhere in and outta town B 
 The same every hood it's so real 
 That you gotta be on your grizzly 
 If not then you might get pideeled 
 This just in, breaking news 
 Today in Downtown Minnesota, a tragic shootout occurred at 5:23 pm 
 An alleged witness says things went haywire over a dice game 
 Two black males were shot in their buttocks 
 Leaving one critically wounded 
 Two others were pronounced dead on the crime scene 
 At a nearby hospital, three New York men are recovering 
 In stable condition but are being held under police supervision at this time

 The way I wear my jeans up over my boots is hood 
 And my cash is good, the grass, spread it out, over the hash is good 
 The grasp who be hypecast is good 
 That's the bird that fucked the game up 
 Cut the head off lames and platinum niggaz, your boy done came up 
 Got my aim up, favorite bling with a millennium chains 
 Chilling, in the staircase, surrounded by killings 
 With bank rolls, bang those, bang your main hoes 
 You was in love with the pussy, it ain't the same though 
 'Cause I'm good, she's good, so you should be good 
 Hit her with the stiff one, she callin' me wood 
 And we don't love those hoes, with they flat butts caked up 
 And tipped up toes, need an ill plastic surgeon to fix they nose 
 'Cause they shit is too fat like an adidas sole 
 Don't even touch my gold, I'm good

 Big butt, slim gut, I'll crash your world

 Sheer lace, fat ass, got want me to taste that

 Blowin' exotic trees, playa, (it's all good) 
 When I'm in the whip, sunk in the six, drunk off the liqs 
 Pull up, stunting, fronting for chicks, (it's all good)

 Jetskiing off the shores of Miami, (it's all good)

 Visions of me swallowing crack, being chased by jake 
 And the sound of the razor keep hitting the plate 
 And tooters is flab with rugers, with daggers and them jeans 
 We chew through it, like we coming down off woolas 
 And my P.O., she half Creole, I move from Philly to Dallas 
 With true talent, like my name is T.O. 
 So when I piss, I gotta piss slow, she know I kick them Vasine bottles 
 'Cause if I'm dirty, I ain't letting it go 
 Your project steps is Ajax down, dry blood 
 Maintenance men with the scrub brush, scraping the ground 
 Diapers, baby rattles and broke lighters, I led many 
 Horses to water, just to see if they like it 
 Taste my, Betty Crock', ready rock, bet he cock, now 
 News flash, my nigga ridin' L, laid a cop down 
 Any of ya niggas want beef, I will stop clowns 
 I got a bad ox' fifth, now how the glock sound? 
 (Ghostface Killah (Sun God)) 
 Aiyo, what up S.G.? (Aiyo, what's poppin' my nigga 
 I'm just oil in the toolies, exercising my trigger 
 Finger, I got the biggest bangers) Yeah, I got a crispy stainless 
 Your man's ain't fucking those hoes, they just a bunch of gamers 
 (Them head shots, neck shots, probably blow they brains in 
 I'm so close to the edge, pushin' they fucking face in) 
 I bet you now, them muthafuckas really start complaining 
 (No hesitation, my reputation'll leave 'em chaining) 
 We go hard, like the NARC's when we start invading 
 (I copped the license and registration, to cock and aiming) 
 It's all entertainment (And all my niggas made it) 
 We hard body like Wu-Tang and Iron Maiden 
 (I keep the iron blazing, hands hurt 
 Like a bitch when she putting braids in, I think it's so amazing) 
 We ran trains for hours, up in the Days Inn 
 Hood rats and crack motels, we seen baking 
 (Outro: Ghostface Killah) 
 (Sounds of crunching and eating) 
 Yeah, good..."

 Yo, aiyo, the Wally man's coming, you can hear his chain dangle 
 Brolic arm, check out the ankle 
 Best cuts, diamond sittin' sideways, like they sit in the cup 
 You can pour Goose on it, juice on it, two Jamaican sluts 
 On the streets, cousin, word life, them big boy Toys'R'Us 
 Got them S5 fifties Maybach's, push suede back 
 Four hundred g's, on the concrete, save that 
 Like James Brown, it's the Big Payback 
 Same place you front's where you get laid at 
 Strong arm a nigga for real, we eat ya food 
 Like dog, muthafucka, in replace of a meal 
 Give you a two hour car chase, flying through lakes and bushes 
 Holding the wheel, still burning the swishes 
 Exotic killas who bribe to kill us, and we pay for a tab 
 Don't matter what size the bill is 
 We don't need your support, wack speech your thought 
 Just to rhyme my shit when the tape cut off 
 The price of fame, a dope chain, the same chain 
 Yo, he tapped to the roof, watch the block, watch 'em hang

 Mean wolves, silver back gorillas 
 Them Theodore kids' gorillas 
 You fucking with experienced killas 
 Silver back gorillas

 The grenade gonna hit like a bomb from Flex 
 The street is never at peace when I palm a tech 
 My enemies is sub, dude, I'm a black belt 
 The moves I do, is how Bruce stick Kareem Abdul 
 Same dudes give a bitch booze, stupid rich dudes 
 Crystal, chandellier ice, keep a wrist full 
 'Cause, if Lil' Jon, can ice his cup 
 I top that shit, and ice my nuts 
 See I'm a threat when it comes to rocks 
 At 3 A.M., you like damn, who put the sun on the block 
 Is he crazy? Illuminate like the Son of God 
 And still pull up in the hoopted out rented car 
 With dust and weed on him, knock the neighborhood bully out 
 Take his gun and pee on him 
 The magazines can't develop my flicks 
 The negatives came, and printed out them c-note chips 
 Keep the heat flaming, beats banging, bottle of weed stanking 
 Competition, yo, I'm giving out strict spankings 
 Burn 'em like bacon, some want Satan 
 In the hell fire, screaming, yo I'm sorry for faking, baking"
99,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,Pokerface,"This is why the World Series of Poker 
 Is decided over a no limit poker tournament 
 Players, pro's even, can't handle the pressure of the game 
 They consider no limit the only pure game left 
 (Chorus: Ghostface Killah) 
 We gotta know how to play your cards, have a mean poker face 
 And know an ace deuce can take out your pocket broads 
 This is no limit hold 'em, you gotta know when to fold 'em 
 If you plan on, staying on top 
 You can't lose, what you don't push into the pot 
 You can't make much either, if you a believer of luck 
 Go all in, if you're feeling your cards, deep in your gut 
 (Shawn Wigs) 
 It was a late Saturday night, big chips, we had a lotta 
 Theodore performed at the Plush Brigatta 
 It was an hour in, big chip leader of the game 
 Caught pocket jacks and flopped two more of the same 
 Looking at quads, waiting for someone to bluff 
 So I checked till someone said ""I had enough"" 
 I'm raising a thousand, son I pay to see the river 
 Caught an ace and his face, was a straight up giver 
 He had three now, must of caught two in the hole 
 A full boat, I'm about to sink ship, tell him to fold 
 He laughs, raises his fifty g's, please I need chip count 
 The pit boss, swear I flip over, you gon' flip out 
 I'm all in, here to win, I rep Staten Island 
 He called it, I showed four jacks, he started wilding 
 This son of bitch... 
 All night, he set me up, he check, check, he trapped me! 
 (Shawn Wigs) 
 It was a cash game, 100/200 dollar table 
 Me and Johnny Mack sitting, God willing and able 
 July 23rd and 4th, the lions is out 
 It's the month of the Leo, we gon' win with no doubt 
 Bunch of high rollers, laughing like he know we're low in the amateurs 
 I buy him for the macks, twenty G's, I'mma damage ya 
 Couple of chuckles, broken glasses, all tinted 
 I'mma put y'all all on tilt, give me a minute 
 So I check raise 'em, bluff 'em, ain't showing my cards 
 Two four off two, y'all ain't no superstars 
 I should have been at the table, World Series of Poker 
 I'm up 80 G's already, y'all a bunch of jokers 
 Now they all on tilt, raising, I call 'em all in 
 With pocket three's, for 80 G's, I'm ready to fall in 
 Flop two aces, caught my three on fourth street 
 A four hundred thousand dollar pot boy, life's sweet 
 He beat me... straight up 
 Pay him, pay Shawn Wigs his money"

 This one's for the boys and the girls on the streets 
 Make sure you listen careful to the words I speak 
 Before you get the drawers, and the bitch wanna eat 
 Make sure you let 'em know to sign the pussy receipt, and

 Greedy bitches, greedy, greedy, bitches (come on) 
 Greedy bitches, greedy, greedy, bitches (and you) 
 Greedy bitches, greedy, greedy, bitches (say what) 
 Greedy bitches, yo, the hoes ate the Oreo's

 Word to my momma, yo, I hate y'all greedy bitches 
 Y'all greasy, after the club, want the piece of chicken 
 Hotel rooms, you better not touch the phone 
 Uh-uh, leave that roof service book alone 
 Don't ask me, for food, I ain't ask you 
 Cut through the bullshit, you can just pass the pool 
 And ya fat friend you brought, she can crash too 
 But if ya stomach growling hard, I'mma laugh, boo 
 No Domino's, Papa John's and Waffle House 
 Frontin' on the pussy, you can throw the dick in your mouth 
 Straight cock, we in the halls, yo there's other twat 
 In Trife room, where them other hoe bitches flock 
 Wigs got it popping, Du-Lilz went bird shopping 
 He got bird seeds, he's probably getting head whopping 
 Fucking with you, yo I hope you ain't cock blocking 
 I want some pussy now, if not, you can get to hopping 
 Bounce, muthafuckas talking about you ain't giving up no pussy 
 (Shawn Wigs) 
 Yo, this is for them greedy bitches, who wanna eat off my buck 
 Who get 99 bananas, 'cause you fresh out of luck 
 I wanna fuck, and you try'nna get a sirloin steak 
 Little money, backstage passes, and some Oreo cake 
 You better split if the legs don't spread like wings 
 This is Theodore, we more than just suicide kings 
 Super groupie, that G on your chest stand for greedy 
 Caught a contact high, 'cause we always bake ziti 
 Blow the gerder's, we just wanna puff and sleep 
 Not in my bed, I'm try'nna put nut in your cheek 
 Little squirrel, my twat team stay on alert 
 I pump iron to them pink panties under your skirt 
 Why try to scheme, my double stuff cream got 'em all 
 On a scavenger hunt, greedy bitch of the month 
 They want a table, when it's time to give pussy, they front 
 You can't play your boy Wigs, like I'm some kind of chump 
 That's right, get 'em out here, yo, Tone 
 (Redman) 
 Yo, I get butter, nigga, like Land O' Lake 
 When bitches see me, they be quick to pump they brakes 
 But wait, before we fuck, let's make it clear 
 If you ask me for a dime... get the fuck out of here 
 Aiyo, you broke nigga, no bitch, you got it wrong 
 I'm still spending, from Red and Meth sitcom 
 What you doing? Stripping, grabbing on groin 
 I bet your momma proud of what you become 
 I'm on the block getting it, hip hop, getting it 
 Blunts got piff in it, new five, whipping it 
 Shorty like ""Redman, buy me a cigarette"" 
 Try'nna get me robbed at the store where her niggas at 
 Greedy bitch, hoods up, hoes down 
 Get money like Barry, looking for MoTown 
 And if I'm in your hood, bitch, high as a fuck 
 Clock the flavor, audio one, your time is up, bitch..."

 God's woman... what's going on? 
 I know things seem messed up sometime 
 You stressed out and you can't handle the situation 
 Sometime it feels like you lacking the guidance 
 And you don't know what to do... but stay strong 
 And keep in mind that he always loves you... 
 It's what it is... that's right sugar love 
 Come on... 
 (Chorus: Willie Cottrell) 
 Josephine, the times are getting tough 
 Seems to me... you just wont get enough 
 The rain, wont wash away, your sins... 
 You'll be here, to do them all over again...

 Yo, I know this chick from the hood named Courtney Cox 
 And her brain is easy to pick like faulty locks 
 She's awfully hot, asshole burning like tobasco 
 She used to be thick, it's like where the hell her ass go 
 Started smoking weed and graduated to the pipe 
 Thought that she could quit but her calculations wasn't right 
 Infactuated with the life of dope fiends and crack pushers 
 Prostituting for old pimps who mack hookers 
 Putting dope in the cook, searching for her vein 
 Tracks all over her arms, she never felt the pain 
 The monkey on her back is now a gorilla 
 Fiending for a hit knowing one day it's gon' kill her 
 The clinic didn't help (nope) she just another young black woman 
 Destroying her pretty image and her health 
 Got me thinking to myself, damn, how could this happen? 
 I seen her on the corner, nodding off, sniffin' and scratching 
 (Trife Da God) 
 She wakes up, with an urge to get high 
 Everyday, the same routine, needing the mood of fix to get by 
 So she reaches for her purse, grab the bag and the needle 
 Tie a sock her arm and start shooting up the diesel 
 Had a flesh back, screwing some dude up in his hashback 
 The night before, body still sore, holding her ass crack 
 A regular John, she met her through Tom 
 She passed out with the syringe still stuck in her arm 
 Dying a slow death, oh, she losing her dear mind 
 From the troubles of the world, feeling cursed by mankind 
 Uh, caught up in a desperate rage, was blessed with AIDS 
 Lost her appetite, hardly slept in days 
 Now it's too late, praying to Jesus, she fucked around 
 With the wrong penis, contaminated with diseases 
 Two months pregnant, carrying around her fetus 
 But they found her on Broad, in the dumpster, behind the cleaners 
 (Interlude: Ghostface Killah) 
 Josephine, what's wrong, baby? 
 Come on... 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Yo, what your momma gonna think of you girl? 
 Her little baby's all doped up, strung out on the world 
 Try'na make some quick cash for a hit of that stash 
 Listen, baby, you growing up much too fast 
 Uh, this goes out to every project and every ghetto 
 For those getting high, using drugs on every level 
 Living your life, day and night, getting stoned 
 You better leave those drugs alone, feel me? 
 (Willie Cottrell) 
 Up all night, under the party lights 
 Same old popping and party hopping 
 All of your so called friends, are leading you down the wrong road 
 Leading you back to crack, it's a known fact 
 It is time, that you need me, I'll be there, to help ya 
 I'll be your leaning pole when you're falling down 
 I'll be there, when you falling down (sooner or later)"

 My nigga Halloween, we gon' get rich this year, nigga (see) 
 Sip on this little bit of odor, made brown 
 Zone out, turn the lights off 
 Ant boogie, what up? Uh-huh 
 (Trife Da God) 
 In the crib, with my wiz, getting my grown man on 
 Listening to classic soul, with the slow jams on 
 Smokey Robinson, Tears of a Clown, shedding tears 
 Popping beers, almost twenty five years in the town 
 I seen niggaz die off, like dandelions in the fall 
 Niggaz heard of Chip Banks and left him lying in the hall 
 Your boy Sandy Brock was ill, like Kobe Bryant with the ball 
 It's no exceptions, even the biggest giants gotta fall 
 'Cause we living in denial, but these lessons are vital 
 When marinating in the slums, you gotta practice survival 
 Now everybody wants to be next American idol 
 But these are more than just songs pressed up your vinyl 
 Being rich is a poor man's dream, and we all wanna shine 
 But we all can't green, knahImean? 
 Being rich is a poor man's dream, and we all wanna shine 
 But we all can't green... 
 (Chorus: Solomon Childs) 
 I grew up hard, maybe you grew up harder 
 But I ain't been to many operas 
 Or had money for private doctors 
 As harsh it sound, these just a tears of a clown 
 I grew up hard, maybe you grew up harder 
 The message is I'm too strong to hold down 
 I know the ledge, and I ain't planning to drown 
 As harsh it sound, these just a tears of a clown

 Momma ain't raised no fool, they say we gotta save the children 
 But first, we gotta save our spoons 
 I was taught not to waste my food 
 Even if I didn't like it, every scrap on my plate got chewed 
 Either you ate, or you didn't eat, the memories are bitter sweet 
 Used to get teased by my friends, 'cause I had bigger feet 
 I think about them jokes and laugh, crack a smile 
 'Cause as a child, I never knew that being broke was bad 
 Growing up I was close to my dad, but that still didn't stop a nigga 
 From putting that coke in them bags 
 That was the past, now, I'm riding with the oak in the dash 
 Got jealous niggaz hating, big time, hoping I crash 
 I can't blame 'em, and on the same note, I can't change 'em 
 Let a nigga disrespect my shit, I'm gonna flame 'em 
 That's word to my son little Jay, my little homey 
 Ask niggaz how your boy get down, ain't nothing phony 
 (Trife Da God) 
 Yeah, they say two heads are better than one, and in the process 
 I learned that slow progress, is better than none 
 That's why I'm still here pursuing my goals, baking that bread 
 In the bakery, if I ain't out, doing no shows 
 I hit the block, once in a blue, and front with the crew 
 And show niggaz a good time, by getting drunk in the stud' 
 Some niggaz find happiness, with a blunt and a brew 
 They talented niggaz, but they just need something to do 
 It's kinda hard try'nna look beyond buildings and bricks 
 We can't condone broken homes, when our children is sick 
 Try'nna survive off the cereal and milk from the WIC 
 And all the good ones we got, be getting killed in the mix 
 He could have been the next Jordan, who knows, the next Emmitt 
 Young Tiger Woods, or the new Arthur Ashe of tennis 
 That's why I'm looking past the gimmicks, getting cash with Dennis 
 Criminal grind, we gonna smash the business 
 Yeah, when you see that big thing pull up 
 Don't be mad at us, man, be glad, we done made it from the projects 
 We done came up, Stapleton Houses, man

 When I catch fish, I fry 'em, to they back I flake 
 I smash y'all muthafuckas like a seedless grape 
 And hang niggas like some ceiling fans in K-Mart plates 
 Feel me? Shake double earthquakes, give thanks, give shanks

 Expose, don't tell, use a mo', round the way

 Your hardest nigga, you can't compare him to ours 
 I'm sitting on crates, I'm missing probation dates 
 I'm stuck with this weight, my wifey period late 
 I'm hot as fuck, my truck keep getting tailed 
 It's like every week, one of mines getting jailed 
 Forgetting bail, piss test failed 
 Got parole on us, then wanna roll on us 
 I'm at my momma crib sleep, who told on us? 
 I'm sick to death, I'm on fire in the streets 
 Like in Back to the Future, when the car left

 Het wet ya, and throw the stocking

 Crack heads get knocked out, right in front of the school 
 Slap 'em Sheek, wake his ass up, he can't even move 
 Cereal box is crack and ratchets, in the cocaine spot 
 My fiends'll box filled with coke head classics 
 Dope money, flood me rags of kush, heavy drags 
 Bodegas, I'm mad, my older sister Patty's a butch 
 Guns come out like my mother's teeth, watch how I'm throwing heat 
 The leg gravy be steaming over smothered beef 
 From eight-ball jackets to cops and robbers 
 My last drug run, I threw in two bricks to garbage 
 I wash my money in Woodlife, duny, sippin' on Folgers 
 Black jewels trucking, still come through bummy"

 You need to just 'walk away' like Kelly Clarkson

 But I figured you said that, that's how I get down 
 Nah of course, you was out there, messing around 
 I would of told you, once you go Ghost, you never go back 
 Try G'ing me, like I don't know how to mack 
 I'm a don, and, top of the line, I stay flying 
 Stop trying, to keep cuff analyzing 
 Using my credit cards to buy diamonds 
 We need to straighten this out, get to the bottom of it all 
 Let's crawl, before we start the war 
 Begin with two reasons why we need to talk 
 And stop popping up in my cribs all over New York 
 And, that's stalking, you such trouble and no good 
 Them fighting words in my block, when we in the hood

 Temperature's so hot, the heat just rise with you 
 Let me ride with you, talk about your mistakes 
 You cheated yourself but these are the breaks 
 And it never be the same again, cause of old boy 
 But oh boy, together we make so much joy 
 In the sands and oh, what a wet, wee-wee 
 But you played me, so I had to roll up my sleeves and 
 Hunt you down, holding the next man's stacks 
 Now you sorry, tryin' bring that old thing back and 
 Act like we can rekindle that flame 
 It's a shame, how you can't get me off the brain 
 He that lame, you love how I bring the pain 
 Got the rug burns stinging and you saying my name 
 Say my name (Ghost!), that's right, I'm high post 
 Get the champagne, love, word up, we goin' toast

 Together like Cheech and Chong, we make nice dreams 
 Fight scenes, I take the good with the bad 
 'Cause you give the best brains that I ever had and 
 Anything worth having is hard to keep 
 I love you like my coffee so hot and so sweet 
 So let's, stick it out, so we never regret it 
 I could forgive the past, but I never forget it

 Hardy Boys shit... uh huh 
 Smoke a Winston to this shit nigga 
 Word up bout to fuckin' throw ya head up, Yeah 
 Yo, yo he got his stones from Greece 
 In mouth he had like thirty plus karats 
 Big ratchets, smoke cigars like a Bogart classic 
 Told niggaz if he dies he want a glass casket 
 Parents died when he was five years old 
 Made his way inside the US with Columbian Gold 
 A fake name and a passport 
 Benetton luggage, one sister, pretty thing, light skin 
 Niggaz will body over her like fuck it 
 With a scar by her left eye 
 Her brother Alex was extremely close, he sold coats and minks 
 Had trays put in toilets and sinks 
 Loved to roller skate, ninety nine did time up in Rahway 
 Came home blown, the thorough kings and soldiers 
 Never gave a fuck about that MC beef in Queens 
 Alex, he was a rich nigga 
 He had close to ten bodies under his belt 
 His man did the last one and got murdered himself 
 Took him a while to get his head together 
 Alex one day out in LA, made a call in New York 
 Told his man Oc, God it's goin' down, fly the whole team in for support 
 Remember that Ray shit that Jamie Foxx played? That was my shit 
 I never got paid, they got rich off a stolen script 
 In ninety eight I seen Charles on the Cali strip 
 Showed him the copyrights, his life in the real flick 
 In Braille, he read it in no time 
 Hit me with his math, said I'll give you some more lines 
 Real talk, stand up dude 
 Said how you like Jamie Foxx to replay you? He said yeah that's cool 
 But under one circumstance, you think he can bow my walk, flip my talk and my hands? 
 I said sure why not, he can imitate anything trust me this young boy hot 
 Shook his hand then I bounced in the limo 
 Grabbed my cell, bit my cigar and then rolled down the window 
 Contacted Stony Brook and Roberts 
 Told them we got it in ten ?, yo Ray Ray signed it 
 Now we can move on and shoot this live shit 
 With mad options, Paramount and DreamWorks we shop it 
 Or Mandalay and New Line cop it 
 I go and get ten mil' and blow it on the independent market 
 But anyway down in PF Chains, I had a meeting with this rich investor 
 Said they'll throw twenty million on the kid's film only if he chose the cast 
 He was drunk, he was talkin' real fast 
 So I test his mouth, laid back then I put him on blast 
 Where exactly we gon' get this cash? 
 I gotta ill Gotti Gigante connect 
 Wise guys that kill Bulotti, catching bodies, earnin' respect 
 The waiter came in a dropped off the shrimp fried rice he ordered 
 I said thanks as he poured my water 
 Then out came the veggie rolls, sesame chicken and mint tea 
 Rice wine had me wanting to pee 
 Said excuse me I'll be right back, pardon me 
 Grabbed his glass and he nodded to me 
 Skated off to take a piss, the shit felt like a nut 
 Got back the dude vanished, briefcase, script, and all 
 Ask the waiter where he go, the motherfucker spoke Spanish"

 I know she gone, but I'm still holding on 
 Still smell the scent of her clothes, only God knows the pain 
 I cried till there's no tears left 
 Love my babies, we can't explain why she left 
 I'm all alone, feeling like my heart is blown 
 I do anything, just to see her come back home 
 But she chose not to hold on, and broke the bond 
 Left me with two babies like I'm Mr. Mom 
 But I'm handle what God gave me, 'cause I'm a good man, and 
 Try to break me down, I'm strong and stay standing 
 Never imagine she gettin' down like that 
 Nine years in this together and you turning your back? Come on

 I can't believe you walked out of my life 
 Not saying I was perfect, babe, but I was willing to work it 
 I know the grass look greener, but you should have stayed beat 
 Let a good man go, so you can run free? 
 Could of held on, to these rough times, and made better ones 
 You left me when my music was down with no fun 
 Broke, I struggled so you made it through college 
 'Cause I had street smarts, but you had knowledge 
 Longevity, suppose to be together forever 
 Now you say we growing apart? Whatever, whatever 
 So I'mma open the cage and set my butterfly free 
 Just hoping it ain't too late when you come on back to me 
 (Chorus w/ Eamon ad-libs)

 But I'mma try to, hold on, and be strong 
 'Cause this time, you're so wrong 
 But I wait, and, I long 
 For you touch, but you're gone 
 All these tears, and all this pain 
 I'll never, never, feel the same 
 I keep control, I lift my soul 
 I sing my song, I hold on

 Second I walked in the whole room got still 
 I don't know how to put this but I'm kind of a big deal.

 Causing me grief, you know me and homie had beef, 
 Now you got me losing my mind out up in these streets 
 You flamingo, showing your true colours, 
 Heard y'all was ducking down low when you seen my brothers 
 But it's all good I move from ex to next, 
 I got the baddest little chick to sign off of the cheques, 
 Fat bubble, her body's one of the best 
 But I don't need to say nothing just ask Kanye West

 Now you're mad 'cause you played yourself, it's your fault chick

 Shot threw the heart the girl got me, 
 Shot threw the block with him shot gun, 
 He lucky I ain't stop, copped the shotgun 
 Killer type cat, better be glad I'm not one.

 You was my moon and my sunshine, 
 Dude ain't even fly - he's just some guy 
 You played yourself I'm young, peace, one

 Which location keeps circulating 
 I want the twin power after day shit on his mason 
 A God steam represent the gummy with the green 
 Who walk fiend stand up on your block and burn a bean 
 Sir Ballentine, lookin' at this bitch walk behind 
 The thing that's fucked up appeal us that's wine 
 They turn around take my last pull off the L 
 These niggas on the block keep looking at me well 
 But they want the jewel it ain't hard to tell 
 I'm recognize his face, he actin' like Denzel 
 But fuck him, I went to check low for chop 
 On a ball gone the size like faith up top 
 Now it's a whole new ball game, strategic mind frame 
 My dialogue's rebellious raid and razor fame 
 Glass out a red light, see Killah get on a ninja bike 
 Show my love to the God he peeled out and made a right 
 (Sound of speeding motorcycle) 
 When you walking down the street with your - Box in your hand 
 And you bringing the music of the - Wu-Tang Clan 
 And you hear Ironman on your - radio rapping 
 Your feet start the dancing and your - hands start the clapping 
 (Verse Two: Street) 
 Street's running through your dancehall gunning 
 Like Lee Harvey Oswald stunning slapping MC's with summons 
 For pumping - that watered down substance 
 Beef there's slugs finger creeping 
 Making moves like Crying Freeman 
 Prince of thieves, earth's third seed 
 Heavyweight like golden fleeces homicides stroll the street 
 If Luther preached it, look at the thugs holding heat 
 In the city beef got me plotting trilogy 
 To the smoke enemies sneak attacks I'm beyond and above that 
 Seen that done that, respect black 
 I catch a slug to your hardhat 
 Lounging in the everglades, surfing the airwave 
 Catch a buck fifty where the razorblades swiftly 
 Shaolin cats be shiesty, strictly 
 Drunk off the Irish whiskey

 Rest your headpiece on this one sun 
 Cough up a lung 
 Sleeping on my murderous type ones I get you done 
 I'm looking at these cuthroat kids and how they live 
 It's like we was partners in spades and you renege 
 Can't fuck with no nigga like that he get me jack 
 Or sent back, meaning whole life fade to black 
 I'm looking in the half of right and roll tight 
 Fool me once but can't fool me twice, I'm 25 
 To life on this mic device ain't nothing nice 
 A mixture of long wild rice and no spice 
 Inflicted, rap addicted, track I stick it, flip it 
 Daddy long dick-ed, slide 
 A little bit beyond twisted, mind in stitches 
 You thought weak but meant wicked 
 Niggas choke off my second hand smoke lifted 
 Everyday is like my birthday I'm mad gifted, dead calm 
 Hit me with the eighteen bronze, buddah palm 
 About to blow like Napalm, before your arm 
 Prepare for the warfare, or buy a share

 Favorite slacks was the baby blue knitted sharkskins 
 Custom made like the ace of spade 
 Switching robes when I leave the forum 
 In the sleeve is a classic date 
 Russian cut, mustard handle, 'bout the same size 
 Of little tight Shawn with his Nikes on, still blamp you 
 Vamp you, throwing homo's out they sandals 
 Leave your brain all chunky like I'm advertising soup from Campbell's 
 Bowl legged old man give me props, all I do is buy 'em a bottle

 Kites and death threats, y'all keep sending 'em 
 For every dart you throw, my last one's killing 'em 
 Like cancer patients, in the process, losing they hair 
 You'll be fighting for life, scratching and gagging 
 Panicking, gasping for air, suffocating from no-wind syndrome 
 Like somebody cut the neck of a deer

 Get lost in my hood, it's like you lost in El Mira 
 You might get poked up, smoked up, throat cut 
 Rocking them little fly chains, get yoked up 
 Y'all Boar's Head niggas, y'all just cold cuts 
 Victims of night time street horror, going home with casualties 
 The twelve gauge blew a path in your knee

 My gear is the world premiere, ox yeah, now I'm dickin down Heather Locklear 
 Rubber glock in the glove box, Benz drop yeah 
 Hit the mall in Long Island, they got hens out there 
 I'm not a sex symbol, gangsta or activist 
 I just bubble like acid in a glass of Cris' 
 My pen's is Illmatic, plush robes drag across the floor 
 Gun hand is sore from choppin the raw 
 And when the jet land smoked up just look right under ya 
 The aircraft carry back half of Colombia 
 Yeah, separate the rubble 
 Stay beatin' niggaz brains out with the God broke belt buckle 
 Jewels, pay respect to my larynx 
 My bird blew niggaz away like a clarinet

 'Cause the Pips be stinky like Pepi LePew 
 And my style's so sick, son, they call it the flu 
 Influenza, top contender 
 Had ya girl head-noddin leavin' marks on my Swollen Member 
 I remember them days when the Stat was my home 
 Now we hop state to state, flyin in and out of zones 
 Had to put down the heat, picked up the microphone 
 Started payin' off the jewelers and flossin in stones 
 Chunky and I ain't talkin' chicken noodle soup 
 Got a V for Vendetta this year and need to recoup 
 That two point five million'll slice a Sicillian 
 Next year we want the whole fuckin' pie we makin' a killin'

 Aiyo, I roll like a bat out of hell, something swell 
 With the money green Balley's and the chunky gazelle's 
 I'm an explorer like Dora, nigga, check out my aura 
 On the block, I assist quarters, but I'm really a scorer 
 Place your order, place your bets, I'll erase your set 
 Puncture your lung and inflate your chest 
 I keep killas on mountain tops, plotting on housing cops 
 While I'm in the spot, bagging up rocks, I'm counting knots 
 I got the eye of an eagle, ride for my people 
 These bars of life dope, and I supply you that diesel 
 I'm a needle in the haystack, laid back in Maybach 
 Slay phat, 'cause he spray gats, try to escape that 
 Gray slacks for, all my Compton killas 
 Casket fillers, armed gorillas, who bomb for skrilla 
 Staten Island's most wanted, the backbone of the city 
 The rapper killings, niggas get slapped silly, you feel me?"

 When you were young... 
 And I'm heading down the same path, uh 
 But the difference between me and you 
 Is, oh, hey, hey, hey 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 There's not a difference, boo, it's real life... 
 It's not ya momma fault, it's ya fathers fault 
 It's your fathers fault your mother is an alcoholic 
 Confusin the brain from the booze and the pain 
 And plus he cheated on her, beated on her, smack dead in the rain 
 She Lost her first child in 74 
 And that lead to nervous breakdowns bicardi dark she downin it raw 
 She can't take it she constantly cryin fallin' down on her knees 
 Like help me lord please I'm ready to leave 
 All she needed was somebody to rub her feet 
 Give her a nice hug and rescue her from off these streets, come on 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 There's not a difference, boo, it's only an 8-figure, back me up 
 I been sent by an angel to snatch you up 
 Take you way above the clouds and back you up 
 At night you can lay in my arms feel the heart beatin' 
 Don status in the sheets I'm keepin' you warm 
 Ain't no nigga gone do what I do 
 Imah take care of you and ya kids 
 Take the bent and go handle ya biz 
 The bills is paid, the cable back on

 Fat, skinny out of shape I'll dior you out 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Wipe ya eyes... 
 Yo in the hood there's a struggle 
 My girls is in trouble 
 She lackin guidance in the mind she's blinded and puzzled 
 Her pops never showed her the ropes 
 Her moms raised mad kids on her own 
 She never had a strong man in her home 
 (Keyshia Cole w/ Ghost ad-libs) 
 Stay stroooooooooong 
 Oh, hey, said we're gonna stay strong 
 No matter what

 You must believe you're givin' everything I need 
 Never to much...

 Snatched the Princess 
 Tricks keep searchin for the glass slipper 
 The first time the brides maid zipped the zipper 
 Then walked down the aisle, look at little pretty Roxanne's smile 
 That's right, she big head child 
 Spot the glass on the hand, white valor laying across the floor 
 Draggin' damn, she got a good man 
 Family in the back, one half on both sides of the church 
 Look at Keisha in the tight ass skirt 
 Mom Duke in the front row, Grandma Pearl sittin' right next our row 
 Beside Uncle Joe, then right before her eyes 
 The preacher ask, ""Would it to death do you part if one dies?"" 
 She replies, ""Yes"", the winnin' words that described best 
 Grandma pinned sittin' 30 on the right breast 
 Now she searchin for the slob-down, the block's slick vitamin joint 
 Mad water in her eyes at this point 
 The man holdin' the Bible announces, ""You're married for life 
 Sign my cheque, peace to the bridal"" 
 Recall this one girl's marriage, one girl's carriage 
 One with the lucky fingers, grab it, she attracted to magnet 
 She might have cracked the safe, seen the cabbage 
 Now it's one love in the tablet 
 (Chorus: Ellie) 
 How do I begin 
 To show you I love you anywhere, it ain't no sin? 
 This love will outlast time, I can't remember when 
 I thought I lost you but now that you're in my arms 
 Just say you'll stay 
 (C-Wiggs) 
 Cobra popped, a bottle of black Burgundy, coversated 
 I stared at your green eyes stagnated, your butter milk skin 
 You smelled good but you taste even better 
 Eye ball walk/talk was first on the agenda 
 I 'member the first time we engaged in the act, in the ac' 
 You jumped on my lap and pushed the seat back 
 Passionate thoughts, I knew you would be the wiz 
 Now you hold my kids, my divine little wiggs 
 The grand souflan 'cause of your presence 
 So I'ma take it back to the essence just like Valentine presents 
 Long tongues and wet kisses, sex positions 
 Buy habista, siesta key, Florida visits 
 You exquisite young heart, I held you by afar, unchained 
 Our physical's 33 within the Range 
 Things have changed over the course of time 
 But you are mine, and I'm yours 
 I'm lookin' forward to you after tours 
 (Chorus: Ellie) 
 How do I begin 
 To show you I love you anywhere, it ain't no sin? 
 This love will outlast time, I can't remember when 
 I thought I lost you but now that you're in my arms 
 Just say you'll stay

 I heard the phone ring, ding, ding 
 Who this? 'Vine yo... 
 Wise guy killed last night by the Tracks, 
 It was the same who our niggas teeth up 
 Sent 'em back, we shoulda thrilled a long time ago 
 We went this recording, now we owe 
 The devil slit trough, without an intro 
 Yo 'Vine, it can't be! 
 Wise guest-starring me 
 Can it be, we both got hit 
 God legendary, he and General 
 He survived A-dog, 
 Hard to even picture god eaten by gray dogs 
 He stayed in his world 
 And he sidely sweard 
 To tell the truth, that DeVon was like 
 ""Your out of cure boo"" 
 Wisegod Allah, warrior 
 XY chromosome, sat heavy on the throne 
 Touched something for you 
 Ya stupid fail niggas fucked up 
 Becouse bitches is talking 
 They living, I'm twisting 
 You alleybag 
 You killed my man, you killed my man 
 And you sent him back 
 After this day, watch your hats 
 Slugs flying everywhere, 
 You could smell heaven in the air 
 You can never get the god, yeah 
 Now I'm cypher, 
 You've been driving off the same battery 
 We had, back in '91 that got you hyper 
 God been beautiful, god been great 
 God fed you, you died but we survived that day 
 You killed your king, Rakeem Allah 
 Gave him his life, he was your offspring 
 Camouflage dog, days was green 
 One righteous man fought for his right, gods pupil 
 Yo, that's my fam, we snatch me out of big head van 
 We tought you how to get gain, from sayin' ""peace god"" 
 As long we translate Allah's tongue, spit the language hard 
 Alley thoughts, identical twin 
 My alias gasanate, the days close, 
 The days close, how'd you know!

 Once the sun comes out and the rain is gone... 
 I know I'm gonna see, a better day 
 I know I think I'm crying, because of you 
 I'm crying, don't want you to see me cry 
 Love you Wise, love you Wise, love you Wise! 
 I wanna go outside, in the rain...

 She's tired, she a house wreck (that's right) 
 Don't buy it, tell me why you said that (""Cause you left me..."") 
 I never left you, you left me 
 You thought if you break out from the kids, you'll be stress free 
 Talkin' 'bout it, baby, you my first lady 
 You let me suck up on them nipples 
 When I get cranky, and taste your kitty 
 So girl, won't you on come back down to Earth 
 Once you land on the Rock, you gonna always see a dirt 
 Face first, they the worst, they searched and searched 
 And the worst, don't it hurt, my love, stay alert

 Two things that you can't touch: My money, my girl 
 The he-say and she-say could fuck up your world 
 Playa-haters, perpetrators, house-breakers 
 Can you see the fact that nigga try'nna live life?

 And didn't nobody ask me on how did I feel 
 But that sugar and my spice, that's wife 
 She's my lady, and we just wanna live right, uh

 I was sixteen, shit, I barely knew what a gram was 
 Studied Scarface, so I knew what the plan was 
 To get that CREAM, and serve them fiends 
 Around the same time my nigga Buck converged with Beans 
 Two way team, posted up on the benches 
 Wit a magnet for a stash, that I kept hid under the black fences 
 Jakes shootin' through the middle, like Kerry Kittles 
 I was baggin' up small hittin' fiends, with very little 
 Though they switched nickels on niggas, and pointed out bitches 
 In the precinct got the snitchin', so they hit 'em off with something decent 
 Avoid the sweeping, them boys is beastin' 
 On point, but I'm kinda paranoid when they creepin'

 Faggot ass niggas, when I ride get the fuck out the way 
 When I see jewels, all I know is take

 Movin' birds and weight, through suburban states 
 God damn it, I told y'all niggas

 Wake ya bitch up, watch the fifth pick up!

 Shakin' niggas upside down on some cartoon shit 
 Change fall all out of their pockets and shit 
 Yellin' and tellin' the cops, fuck y'all niggas! 
 This is Theodore, bitch"
126,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,Heard It All Before,"(Intro: Ghostface Killah) 
 Yes, yes, we like to thank you 
 You are the 77th caller 
 You know you just won a pair of Theodore drawers and all that 
 How do you feel about that? (Oh my God, that is good daddy I love y'all) 
 Yeah, that's right baby, no doubt... right now, his name is Ghostface 
 Check this joint out right here, it's new, word up 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 I'm the Mighty Joe Young of rap 
 Live off of mighty gold, tongue and yack 
 Y'all be amazed how I brought it back 
 Two porsche's, big ass ranch with twelve horses 
 Scarface breeze when I speak, the all bosses 
 Plus the jewelry so truck, the cuffs get you nauseous 
 Two years, been through like six divorces 
 Now the talking put my business in the street, but 
 I'm like cement, I rock when I step 
 Kill music with no hands and leave with no weed stuff 
 Like my bitches better when they wore Reebok's 
 See hot, let's have a toast, I verbally bomb deacons 
 Have the whole church praying for Ghost 
 When we speak we give sermons, and switch our names over permits 
 The big shit, you might get burned with 
 God-body fly automobiles with grills 
 Two thousand, fifteen, nigga, we can take off the wheel 
 A Georget Jetson, so y'all sit still 
 Chill, peace to Queens, so the God Allah reel's reel 
 It's the takeover, breaks over, make something 
 For funny ass package, who want, and a cake over 
 Monster bangels, bojangles got the forty cocked from all angles 
 Fuck a rope nigga, my gold chain'll hang you 
 Danish darts, language arts, slanger banger you 
 Punk motherfucka... 
 (Chorus: Ghostface Killah) 
 All you talk is poor... 
 All of your fushu, I got gats, Ghostface that 
 But your rhymes ain't workin' now, look who's hurtin' now 
 I had to shut you down, I had to shut you down 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Welcome to Saturday Night Live, write rhymes 
 Glide on beats, and we high from the police 
 The dogs bark funny, in fact, when I'm clean 
 They can smell mark money, truck and mad bummy 
 Off the peter, grab shoots, Cerebel Paisley 
 Gats, pull out the mack on cancer, the ooh-wop 
 I bag down AIDS, word to the U.S. 
 There's no need to panic, yo, we been through a phase 
 Like, namebelts, got the fronts in Alfa Romeo's 
 Tent the patrol niggas, that we had on a payrole 
 I play on niggas like stop and go 
 And tell the other liquors that Don pop more 
 And Venus told Mercury she a hot ho 
 Me, I'm just thinkin' bout what's next for Ghost 
 The Enterprise worth billions, delay America 
 To Africa, home away, the six text-tillion 
 Turn, Siskel and Ebert givin' two thumbs 
 New York Times call it my best work, bump to it 
 You can Rolling Stone every bone, and kill 'em at the Grammy's 
 Have 'em sit down, polly with the top five families 
 Blocka-blocka, boom, now they all dead 
 Now I'm the only one gettin' that bread, that's right 
 And the only one rockin' those threads 
 See these cowards let the fuckin' lead go to they head 
 (Hook: Ghostface Killah) 
 I needed to scream on all y'all bitches, birds 
 But the more you bite my style, the more I learn 
 Your rhymes ain't workin' now, look who's hurtin' now 
 I had to shut you down, I had to shut you down 
 (Outro: Ghostface Killah) 
 God, yeah, party people 
 You are now listenin' to the sounds of Ghost Radio 
 777 F.M. and all that, no doubt 
 It's real right about now, yeah 
 The dance floor is packed and all that 
 Everything lookin' glory, I see asses 
 I see glasses in the air, yo, put your hands in the air 
 Come one, let me hear you see Theodore, ""Theodore"" 
 Theodore, ""Theodore"", yeah, yeah 
 That was chunky and all that 
 No doubt, but yo, where Staten Island at? 
 Where y'all at? Make some noise, yo, yo, come on 
 Yeah, check-check-check-check me out 
 Check-check-checkin' me out, come on 
 Take-take-take-takin' me out, whose take-take-takin' me out 
 Come on baby, take me out, uh-huh, yeah, no doubt, no doubt"
127,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,Toney Sigel A.K.A. The Barrel Brothers,"(Ghostface Killah) 
 Yo, straight out the ghetto, I'm damn hood 
 I stack a dollar like a whole rack of canned goods 
 Baggy jeans, no chimps, ACG Boots 
 Livin' in the crack spot, bangin' that Sheek Louch 
 The narcotics is far from garbage, whether it's cold or it's late August 
 My shit is fresh 'cause I catch the hottest 
 My little cousin bubble swatches and carry a couple oxes 
 Keep a deuce deuce by his ankle and get it poppin' 
 You know, we be the boys clockin' the grave yard shift 
 Big bubbles, countin' the cream, burnin' the lazar spliff 
 My man jumps out the whip with the AR 5th 
 And we ball from plentys of parties 'cause we start shit 
 Parole holes, six months in the box 
 My little sister got her head shaved off 
 She made it home for shop 
 We sellin' Carters, Pampers, Similac formula 
 Anything ya take 'cause the paper keep callin ya 
 Gangsters keep ballin fosho, we want more 
 We make it rain from the tech and the wop 
 The next coroner priests don't have enough cups for us 
 To slow us up, they hit us with dusk 
 Then they rush-bust, my man Big Ron will break the cuffs 
 300 pound nigga, po po has to fuck him up 
 They say that my projects should undergo therapy 
 We never voted, we votin' for Oprah, Obama, and Eric B. 
 Guns imported from Dubra 
 Wheel jazz and shit bags 
 Peach Snapples and pretty scalpels 
 Renaissance 
 I'll stick a pick in yo gut at the chapel 
 I'll blow a nigga for a box of Huggies 
 Cop killers with a box of dummies 
 Dummies stuck to the project floors 
 Niggas is suited up and be ready for war 
 (Beanie Sigel) 
 It's the Broadstreet Bully and the Killah with no Face 
 My mac bullets burn like tequila with no chase 
 My knife work like the guillotine sword 
 Cut niggas, stop frontin' for my killa bee swarm, something 
 Empty out the whole clip and reload 
 Shot gun barrel leave you smokin' like a broke stove 
 Yeah, and I'm all about that bullshit 
 The casket, the hearse, and the pastor in the pulpit 
 I kill a nigga at the drop of a dime 
 Just imagine what I do for a quarter 
 Ain't no tellin' what I do for a dollar 
 Pop a nigga right in front of his mama 
 Son a nigga right in front of his daughter 
 And I'm nothin' like a father 
 Couldn't come from these nuts I got 
 To see Baltimore suck this cock 
 I know most of y'all wouldn't understand 
 Get it, understand 
 Yeah some niggas will and some niggas won't 
 Like some niggas kill and some niggas don't 
 You's a fake it till you make it type a nigga 
 I'm a straight up take it type a nigga 
 Pistol whip a nigga till I break it type a nigga 
 I'm hard on chumps, most of these dudes is fags 
 Put the guarder on pumps, push the broom up they ass 
 Or the knife like American me, American Sig' is Muslim 
 So I ain't feelin' Bush overseas 
 I think with the wisdom of Malcolm, got the soul of a panther 
 So by any means is the anthem 
 You gonna have to cut me out the track like cancer 
 I can't stop won't stop 
 This how we do it from Philly to Chi..."
128,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,Yolanda's House,"(Ghostface Killah) 
 Ay yo I'm skinned up, Nike's is scuffed 
 Still buggin' earlier around four how I escaped the bust 
 The way I fell cracked the face of my watch 
 My man's chantin' me on like ""Run son! Don't go up in the spot"" 
 Jettin' through bushes and backyards, neighbors is rattin' me out 
 Dogs is barkin' all you hear is the car's sirens 
 I'm tryin' to think and toss the iron 
 Bomb in my sweats got me runnin' funny, you think I'm lyin' 
 May God strike me if he don't like me, I'm tired and I'm out of breath 
 The weed got me paranoid, my heart's poundin' through my chest 
 Tryin' to focus up and make progress 
 That's what I get for slingin' in them projects 
 Next thing you know I'm in this bitch's crib chillin' 
 Told her my story and like this I had her legs in the ceiling 
 Cookin' me fried fish sticks, hot side of them biscuits 
 While she doin' this, the bitch still slidin' on lipstick 
 Now I got the fat stomach on, she crackin' a dutch 
 I'm playin' with her pussy on the couch, I'm ready to fuck 
 Like come here miss lady wop, where you put the condom box? 
 She finished off the last one, oh shit I hear the cops 
 Handcuffs and talkies, I mashed her white Yorkie 
 Jettin' up the stairs, them pigs want revenge like Porky's 
 So I slid, hid behind the wall, opened the door 
 Like ooh I seen my man Meth goin' in raw 
 So he jumped up balls out, I hid in the closet 
 I'm dyin' laughin', he said ""Yo Starks be quiet!"" 
 (Method Man) 
 Now let me put my drawers on, nigga what kinda dope you on? 
 Should've knocked before you came in the spot, Ghost you wrong 
 Bustin' in here on the government shit 
 Got this chick screamin' grabbin the sheets tryin' to cover her tits 
 She's asthmatic and you laughin' son 
 I bump my toe on the nightstand just runnin' tryin' to grab the gun 
 Shit's real man, you spazzin' dun 
 There comes a time in a man's life, he gotta toss his pack and run 
 You know we family like Crack and Pun 
 But Mr. GFK, state your business after that be one 
 Now can it be that you hot lord? 
 You did some shit on the block that the cops tryin' to lock you for? 
 Can't believe you blowin' the spot lord 
 My chick is buggin', she trippin' 
 My dick keep slippin' out my boxer drawers 
 Now I'm caught up in the drug sting 
 Niggas is callin' my horn, police is hittin' every corner we on 
 Can't understand it, it's a thug thing 
 And in the moment of thought, I'm interrupted by Shallah Raekwon 
 (Raekwon) 
 I need my money Meth, gonna by them hundred birds 
 Tell Tone get at me, all them little clients want work 
 He know we fresh out, tell the kid meet me, matter of fact beep me 
 Word to mother lord, son he got me hurt 
 You still fuckin' shorty? I knew it 
 The big mouth broad that be yolkin' my balls out 
 Her little brother wanted two bricks 
 You know the nigga licks, a Maybach on twenty-six 
 All he do is get money, hustle, he's a dick 
 He told me foul shit, wild shit 
 That nigga wear a lot of loud shit, no that Steve Rifkind style shit 
 Hit me with some other talk, him in New York 
 They robbed the Venezuelan niggas, stabbed his son with a fork 
 That was Jesus' rooster's little niece, little nooses 
 Father's homeboy, that's the kid who gave us a boost 
 He gave them things on the arm, said for us to be calm 
 And if some beef pop off, go ahead and ring the alarm"

 Yo, Ghostface, go in heavy, man, let's do it

 (I just want to celebrate) Like we just beat trial 
 (I just want to celebrate) We hype for just bein here 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Stones on every arm, the crib is ten million 
 The corks from Dom Perignon can't reach my ceiling 
 Four maids with four grenades 
 When the sun's in my face, all I do is lower the walls for shade 
 The pool's a pain in the ass, fifty grand on Windex kid 
 They keep it clean the whole bottom is glass 
 So you can see the sharks and piranhas, a pair of pajamas 
 That's my neighbor, the faggot disresepecting my mama 
 No cars in the garage, it's underground shit 
 They way the floor open up you think I'm hiding spaceships 
 French chefs, the best grapes on they breath 
 Louie aprons on the Yank cats, the puffy cooks the rest 
 Besides I got birds that never leave the nest 
 They fuck with me, I'll watch 'em confess, then I'll go rest 
 Get back up deposit them checks 
 Muthafuckas fuckin' up a good time by snappin your necks, come on 
 (Chorus 2: Ghostface Killah (Rare Earth sample))

 Money for everybody, candy to the kids 
 Catch me on dateline, Starky too big

 Mansion parties for all star weekend in my L.A. crib 
 We can to party, run out of Goose we got Dollies 
 Shorties wettin me, check out her body, uh 
 Throw up your hands like it's your birthda, mommy 
 Let's celebrate, now I got her girlfriends behind me 
 Now I'm in the middle, watch is all chiseled 
 I can holla at the birds like Dr. Dolittle 
 (What's that in your pocket Ghost?) a Dill pickle 
 (Not that) oh that's the forty-five stainless nickel 
 I'm pullin a green, gotta G for the biggest ass 
 On the floor who look right in them jeans 
 If you fat, I might take one for the team 
 But I gotta get drunk first knowhatimean, come on 
 (Chorus 3: Ghostface Killah (Rare Earth sample))

 (I just want to celebrate) We bout to have a good year 
 (Ghostface Killah (Cocoa Channelle)) 
 Na-na-na-na-nah, you can't catch me 
 I'm out like Thomas in, in a five-fifty 
 Police be fiendin to frisk me 
 I'm so legit I walk away with the car keys pissy 
 Back at the labo, shorty wop need a Dutch 
 He fuckin' wit a Goose dick, tonight I'ma beat it up 
 Your thing to wet, you sure you ain't seeded up 
 (That's how I get Ghost, especially when you eat it up) 
 My goodness gracious, ass is flirtatious 
 Move it around like a snake miss or sexy waitress 
 Ghost don't have no patience 
 I like you, I usually change chicks like radio stations 
 I'm, definitely not lookin' for love 
 But if you give it to me right now I might say I was 
 You can chill if you want I got crazy bud 
 But before we do what it do, go jump in the tub, come on 
 (Chorus 4: Trife Da God (Rare Earth sample) {Ghostface Killah}) 
 (I just want to celebrate) Throw ya hands up nigga 
 (I just want to celebrate) Pop the 'pagne, pop the cork 
 (I just want to celebrate) Representin on the streets of New York 
 (I just want to celebrate) {We bout to have a good year}

 Yeah, we gets it in, gets it in, gets it in 
 New York, we been had it, we gets it in 
 Outta town we fuckin' up but gets it in 
 Worldwide we doin', we gets it in 
 The Ghostface, Kid Capri, I gets it in 
 That's no joke, when we here, we get it in 
 No kidding, in the building, getting it in

130,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,Walk Around,"(Intro {*chorus plays along with the intro*}) 
 Get the mic on 
 I don't know what happened, son 
 I just lost my mind, son 
 It's like I wasn't strong, G, I couldn't hold it when I seen it 
 A nigga flesh on me, I can't really-- I couldn't hold it, G 
 I don't know, I'mma, listen, no I went like this, nigga 
 I walk around acting strange, like a man in a daze 
 People talking to me and calling my name 
 But I don't hear a word they say... 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 It was him, the cornerstore and a buttered roll 
 The shit dropped when I gave him two stomach holes 
 One to the face, he fell sideways 
 I was up close, so part of his nose was stuck to my padres 
 Standin' over him shakin', kid, screamin' 
 He slapped my girl, that's the reason why I was f'in to lean 'im 
 Everything got real slow, I ain't hear shit, my word 
 At least 40 seconds, I stay dead stiff 
 I pound him with the gun out, Big Din came, opened my hand 
 Removed the gun and the 16 spun out 
 He floored past 90 on the BQE 
 I threw up all on his door, splashed his Gucci seats 
 I couldn't speak, I'm in a state of shock 
 About now there should be yellow tape on the block, a raid at my spot 
 Hey, yo, I feel a li'l bugged out, insane, I lost my mind 
 People tellin' me, Ghost, you actin' mad strange 
 (Interlude {*Chorus plays along with interlude*}) 
 See what I'm sayin'? I don't know, I just don't feel right 
 Havin' flashbacks, bugged out, man, knahmean? 
 Nah, I don't wanna go to the clinic, I don't want the hospital, son 
 You know, I just feel like I'm lost, reality, man, y'knahmean? 
 My face feels numb, son 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Flashbacks to me blowin' his brains out 
 All I remember's my shirt, I couldn't get them goddamned stains out 
 Oxy cleans wheat 'round the chest area 
 Righthand side, I'm pluckin' off li'l pieces of meat 
 And my goons want me to bounce to Tennessee 
 But I said no, I got these two snow-bunnies in Venice Beach 
 On the low, son, I sleep with the hawk, in East New York 
 'Round my man Killa' way where all the murderers walk 
 Manhunt, police searches, swat ran in my crib 
 Battering rams, early mornin', yo, waking my kids 
 Now my aunt gotta stay wit' my wiz 
 She paranoid, havin' anxiety attacks 'cause of these pigs 
 Plus my connect, they goin' crazy, they try'na slay me 
 I told 'em, Friday I'll have they money, faggots try'na play me 
 I'll never eat up out a garbage can 
 I'll Larry Davis a cop, and if I make it alive, it was the Father's plan 
 (Outro 1 {*outro 2 plays along with outro 1*}) 
 I ain't goin' nowhere, I ain't goin' nowwhere, I'm aight, I'm aight 
 But I know one thing, if anybody touch me, I'm blowin' they head smooth off 
 Cops, connects, I don't give a fuck, they gon' feel that Eagle, they gon' feel that Desert 
 They gon' feel that Bulldog, y'knahmean? I don't give a fuck 
 Don't put me in no mental clinics, it ain't nothin', y'knahmean? 
 If I make it out alive, I make it out alive, if not, fuck it 
 Yo, I can't take this shit no more, it's too hype 
 Niggas thinkin' I'm buggin' out, I ain't buggin' 
 Y'all niggaz'd be buggin' out too if you had somebody's flesh on you 
 Motherfuckers, fuck y'all niggaz, I ain't goin' crazy 
 Sleepin' on couches and shit... I'm goin' back outside, fuck y'all niggaz, man 
 I walk around acting strange, like a man in a daze 
 People talking to me and calling my name 
 But I don't hear a word they say 
 I walk around acting strange, like a man in a daze 
 People talking to me and calling my name 
 But I don't hear a word they say 
 I know my Mother's worried about me 
 'Cause they might have to put me away at any time 
 'Cause when my baby packed up her clothes and left me 
 She oh! I believe she took my mind..."

 Yeah, yeah, we want all that shit, we'll take all that shit 
 Sneak up on 'im right, feel me? 
 Soon as he turn around, just yapp this nigga 
 I got everything, youknowImean? 
 They ain't gotta do nothing, but just search them bitches 
 Let's go... 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
 This is a stick up, I want y'all to lift y'all skirts 
 I mean shirts, take ya hoodies off, jackets and watches 
 Before you put ya hands on the wall, empty ya pockets 
 Fix ya face, this a robbery, nigga, respect the juks 
 Stop shaking, you making me nervous, I know that you shook 
 The fuck is that sticking out from under ya foot? 
 Move, turn ya head around, nigga, you better not look 
 Stacks, you hiding from Tone? I'll shake, rattle ya bones 
 You killed him! Nah, hit him with the back of the fucking chrome 
 In the dark, yo, I do this alone 
 That's the reason why I don't shake hands, in case I gave you a phone 
 That's a buck fifty, long hickey, when I strike I do it quickly 
 Creep up on my victims swiftly, make it hard for you to stick me 
 'Cause if we shoot it out, 'cause if I die tonight you coming with me 
 Bitch-ass nigga, eat through ya chest like some fucking whiskey 
 (Chorus: Solomon Childs) 
 BOY! Gut him like a pig in the dark 
 Or auction off ya bitch body parts 
 BOY! Poison a guard dog, disarm the alarm devices 
 Throw ya head in vicegrips (yeah) 
 BOY! Or stick a hot blade through his heart 
 Get to sticking niggaz for the right prices 
 BOY! Yeah, this is priceless... GET 'EM! 
 (Sun God) 
 Aiyo, I post up, packed the shotti 
 Black mags in lobbies, with red dots, to detach the body 
 If you a boss, why ya cash is sloppy? 
 This a Staten Island burglar gang, ock, not no Ave could stop me 
 I'm on the road, not no massive robbery 
 When it come to that dough, it over flow like paper bag tsunamis 
 I take shit, lumberjacks and Tommy's 
 Niggaz passing out bombs like Culpepper, so I pass behind 'em 
 My black glove, black mask, requirements 
 Sent the order to Trife Dies', and he gon' send 'em fast, they flying in 
 These cowards couldn't clash our lion's den 
 That forty-four mag'll twist ya aves and the cav you flying in 
 We hoping out cabs like Iron Men 
 It's hard to believe how niggaz leave with no bag supplying sense 
 Empty 'cause my staff is hiring 
 Canine dogs with felonies duck fast when firing 
 (Trife Da God) 
 Aiyo, we carry arms like a octopus 
 Shorty's strapped with the mac inside her pocket book 
 Blowing all lots of kush 
 Dark tints on the V so the D's can't spot the crooks 
 Just throw ya hands in the sky, don't try to stop the juks 
 Face down, lay on the ground, no sudden moves 
 Yo, then, take off his Timbs and get the work out his shoes 
 Rip off the pockets out his shoes, make sure he come out his used 
 I hear sirens, plus the cameras is watching, it's time to move 
 If you lolly-gagging, word to mama, I'll body bag 'im 
 Leave his frame riddled with holes, looking like Gotti had 'im 
 Bragging, juked, in the wagon, laughing 
 We slid a few blocks down, this kid was frozen 
 With stones so we decided to yapp 'im 
 I put the tool in his mouth, said ""You don't want the action 
 These ain't E pills, nigga, these is fuckin' aspirin 
 Bean, blast 'im, Homo' get his girl for his cash and 
 Yo, E, go stop the whip, they 'bout to witness a slashing"" (BOY!)"

 Well, surprise mothafucka, Starkey Love got breakfast 
 Got some steaming hot biscuits, you can eat this toast 
 Shots blow through ya meatloaf and lace ya back 
 Turn you over like a pancake and take ya gat 
 That's not damn near the half of it 
 Cops came, said the Killahs ain't risk 
 Game and the flow's so accurate 
 Anything's possible, black, you mad profitable 
 Waste no time, breath, air on popping you 
 Put you on the guest list, go dance with death 
 The club's dead, yeah, you right, you the last one left 
 See the spooks in, goths in, devils in, fire's in 
 You dwelling in hell where them snitch niggaz lyin', friend 
 Ya skin start bubbling from in the hot oven 
 Say peace to my man down there, K-Dozen 
 It's Ghost, pressing y'all clowns on the regular 
 Dead you on a five pack, then take ya cellular 
 Don't get it twisted, black, 'cause I'll bury ya 
 This is just weed money, the more, the merrier

 They call me the Superman lover 
 Said, they call me the Superman lover 
 Yeah, plus I'm wrong...

 Aiyo, G4 jets with like three and four pets 
 Sex, Beck's, chicken and hens, all the same sex 
 Walk through the Amazon, spilling Dom, Moet 
 To find my way back I gotta leave a trail of bagettes 
 My tongue's like a four-pound, my game is ill 
 Twist a chick like a Rubik's cube, now what's the deal? 
 Chocolate, light skin, meet Mr. Excitement 
 Got my D.D.L. on me, that's my Dick 'em Down License 
 Never wife 'em, strike just like lightning 
 I stay piping, hype just like Hype is 
 Bitches wanna see me and my rindstone drawers 
 Call in sick at work, then they take off 
 For me, spread 'em out for Starky 
 My mouth may drizzle like BizMarkie 
 I get it in like any car key 
 My stroke is on, I'm never rusty 
 Uh-uh, but if you wanna play, this is what you gonna say 
 That I got the best D, he could hit it all day 
 Something like a rising star that's on Broadway 
 Sex real live with a Illmatic foreplay 
 (Interlude: Ghostface Killah (sample)) 
 Oh shit, it's that Bally, it's that slick Bally 
 '88 material, little niggaz don't know 
 Nothing about this though 
 Check it out y'all (look) come on (look) yeah, come on 
 (Up in the sky) When I'm at the bar, 
 Or in a rented car (look)

 Jewerly truck, don't touch 
 Yeah, yeah, come on, when I'm in the streets

 When was doing this shit son, youknowhatimean? 
 Yeah, check the story 
 Ghostface Killah: 
 I done flushed bags of powder down project toilets 
 You could of found of me on the steps dusted, unable to call it 
 Jums in my pocket, the rental was stolen, tapping pockets 
 On the local drug dealers, just to see what they holding 
 I know, niggaz with crack viles stuck to they colon 
 The acid, done bubbled up, now they stomach's is swollen 
 That just, life in the hood, surrounded class, who we bag in our stash 
 The ultraviolet haze, we hit it and pass 
 We toast to the Ghost of old days, yeah, old ager hump 
 We rap renegades, must stay paid

 Big fluffed out gooses on, Stan Smiths 
 The housing cops can suck our dicks, we jumping out 
 Of convertible matchbox shits, next drip inhaling 
 Chilling, my throat frozen, my orange brick 
 Bottles of Cru', bitches with Baby Phats, they swinging ax 
 They singing, you still blinging, daddy, now bring it back 
 The smokest rap nigga, honey, I'mma need a match 
 To bust the game wide open, I'mma need an ax 
 I juggle this, practice, smuggle heroin in the cactus 
 Keep a hood, I still go and fuck a fat bitch 
 Actress, slinging the backs of five Cleopatras 
 A cocaine Chef, I stretch money like elastic 
 My raps is bigger, dynamics with the muscle advantage 
 Jake Cutler on dust, when I blam shit 
 Raekwon: 
 Yo, we been bagging since 18, kid, Polo Rugs on with gloves on 
 Rented cars, fronting on winning broads 
 Gum slow, half moon, leather pants, Avia' days 
 Keep your hands off my blunt and my waves 
 Beneton, Superman bomb, everybody in the lobby, we clapping 
 Hats on, protecting your moms, you know how we play 
 Spray something down if the team say 
 It's on, I dedicate my lines to the PJ's 
 Triple beams, Pyrex jars, smoking nickel weeds 
 All we did is look mad fly, icicle rings 
 Whatever homeboy, you want it? You could get your receipt 
 A little closer, you can sense we got heat, it's only me 
 Plus four other I'll gangstas, we all anxious 
 To blow up your block and spank shit 
 U-God: 
 Yo, I'm down for the get down, hit the town, sick the bloodhounds on 'em 
 I rip clowns, I flip pounds, I spit rounds 
 I'm on the prowl, my stomach growl, crushed by the crowd 
 Rush through Loud Records, drop mushroom clouds 
 I'm not a rapper, I'm spellbound, I melt down 
 Your G-Force, with heat walks 
 Free falling to a better money, bet he's hungry 
 Spread the honey, big head inside the Humvee 
 Mix lead inside my lungies, spend bread on my Dungarees 
 And such and such, Ghost plugged me with this slut 
 Don't hug me, bug me, I'm ugly when I fuck 
 I'm hard like a jungle hunter, bust off in Heather 
 Double cross me, lift your boss off your feet, 'course he's feather 
 Whatever, whatever, he cried indepence 
 Tennis players get fried, playing both sides of the ends 
 Keep your eyes on your friends, 'cause they spy for the feds 
 Watch me rise from the dead, I got ties with the dreads"
135,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,The Prayer,"Sometimes I feel like he don't hear me 
 Sometimes I wonder, do he love me 
 Life is so hard for me 
 This ain't the way it's supposed to be 
 I pray every night asking for forgiveness 
 Sometimes ask myself is it worth it 
 Life is so pain, painful 
 Yet I'm so thank, thankful 
 Life wont be easy and I know that 
 My past is over, wish I can go back 
 Maybe I change-anges 
 Rearrange-anges 
 Sometimes times in life we all feel like we are feel like we falling 
 Those who suffer in life will be rewarded 
 Lord I hear you but it's so hard being strong 
 I keep reminiscing all my loved ones that are gone 
 He says hun you should know you're born to die 
 I say I do it's just so hard saying bye 
 That's why, feel like, you don't hear me 
 Sometimes I wonder, do you love me 
 Life is so hard for me 
 This ain't the way it's supposed to be"

 (What did I do? Was the thing so bad?) It's like... 
 Yo, there ain't too many people I would die for 
 That I would lay down for, you heard... 
 It's like my family, my closest friends that's here in my circle 
 YouknowImean? My moms and 'em, my babies, man 
 That's word to mother, son, that's what it is... 
 (I'll die for you, I'll die for you) Uh-huh... 
 That's right, man (I'll die for you) Just some real shit... 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Aiyo, I'll die for the prophets and I'll die for the Lord 
 On the battlefield, wounded badly, holding a sword 
 With no questions asked, I already know, it's all for the cause 
 Just laying me facing the East, when I'm under the floor 
 I might've sinned in the process, from being, in the projects 
 Eyes swept from all the anger, that could've fucked with my conscience 
 And more or less, I'm a man of my word 
 My body is holding a couple scars on it, though I was never a bird 
 (Hook: Ghostface Killah (sample)) 
 For Martin Luther and my brother Malcolm (I'll die for you) 
 And my ancestors picking cotton (I'll die for you) 
 My close homies that get it popping (I'll die for you) 
 You what time it is, nigga what? 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Aiyo, I'd die for my moms, and I'd die for my kids 
 If you, really my Queen, then I'd die for my whiz 
 Even my man's, if we that tight 
 Jump in front of a biscuit, snuff money with all of my mics 
 Or we can brawl it out and take his life 
 By taking his gun, no problem 
 Just make sure we eating when we on the run 
 Like slaves that's chained together, who killed master? 
 The dogs is coming, the pigs is gon' blast ya 
 I'd die for you, I'd die for my brother 
 Die for the babies who can't eat with bare feet who need they mother 
 I put niggaz lights out like Con Ed, my verbal is barn 
 My bread'll blow you, show you who's real with the arms 
 (Hook: Ghostface Killah (sample)) 
 Dog, you want revenge on that devil Satan? (I'll die for you) 
 We could do it now instead of waiting (I'll die for you) 
 We don't have to wait for revelations (I'll die for you) 
 We'll sort this out in other conversations 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Yo, I'd never jump out the window, lose my life for a lame ass nigga 
 That scene is bogus, it's not in the picture 
 You just can't feed me anything like ""Yo, Tone it's beef"" 
 Expect me to go all out, jump in and bust my heat 
 First off, drunk, you not my peeps 
 Yeah, I know you, we from the same town and shit, but we ain't that deep 
 We never stuck nothing, oxed something, ran together, popped something 
 I thought ya team was Wolves, cocksucker, stop fronting 
 You barking like you got the town in a smash 
 I'd never lay down for you, faggot nigga, you ass 
 (Hook: Ghostface Killah (sample)) 
 Wop them niggaz that be yelling that (I'll die for you) 
 When they broke you be heating that (I'll die for you)

 Catch me on yo' brochure with beachballs, at least three whores 
 Head wop Queens know how to work they jaws 
 They skintone is coffee and milk, mixed up 
 Ass as big as my boss' wife, stomach ripped up 
 Spitting liquor in they mouth, cold Moet 
 Captain Morgan, taking flicks, posing, holding my tech 
 With cowboy hats and coach bags, they party like rockstars 
 Bo Gary watches, just chill, they down in the shark bars 
 And me, gunslinger, clips, cock D 
 My fashion on, I'm rocking 'em new Rasheeds 
 I'ma finish ya, go in brother like Mr. Cee 
 You could find me fucked up like the mice in cheese

 Bottles, biscuits, bitches, blunts, bad boys bodying pit bulls 
 Karate, black belt and I bring booze 
 To big bar brawls, ball games blasting, fuck till my balls blue

 We like the black Yankees, old vets who sit in the rest 
 Thankful, counting up currency and move when it rain, pour 
 From every bitch that we bless, we hit up, automatic love 
 The Cuban Link niggaz is the realest 
 My wallet walk, speak to niggaz, cops, judges 
 We put it down, Columbian style, with three killas 
 Based on money, dummies'll die 
 It ain't funny, trying to front on mine, we get in ya mommy 
 Keep cool, nigga, read him the rules, before he bleeding in pools 
 And fuck my shit up, and I'ma just lose 
 Paid a lot of paper to live here 
 American Gangster status, Big Brother, lemme get in ya ear 
 You know what time it is, crime it is 
 No matter what rhyme it is 
 We gon' stay fly, hit lye, rock diamond shits (no question) 
 Based on a general's fist of fury 
 Neck, arm, money, all of that's crispy jewelry

 Let me show you how I g ride, nina on both sides 
 Nobody riding shotgun but the four-five 
 Nigga, if you won't try, I'll give ya something to regret 
 Throw that mothafucking semi to ya neck 
 Throw the other black Jimmy to ya chest 
 If you budge, you get stretched, nothing more, nothing less 
 Pay respect, I'm a element of Homicide Housing 
 In other words, bitch, I'm the resident from Homicide Housing 
 Known for drug dealing, stack thousands 
 Four hundred grand in the couches, two hundred grand on the houses 
 At any time I could move up out this 
 And go and cop some shit up in the moutains

 Aiyo, aiyo, you know ya boy stay fresher than produce 
 Timberland snow boots, collecting more CREAM than a toll booth 
 I grind daily, Patriotic like Tom Brady 
 I'm the bomb baby, 'cause what I write is beyond crazy 
 I'm the Don with the teflon armor, good karma, mac palmer 
 Call me Arab Diesel 'cause I'm a track bomber 
 Roger that, my niggaz ain't got it cracked 
 All we do is dollar stack, get twisted like bottlecaps 
 While you on the block getting indicted 
 We island hopping, globe trotting through the friendly skies flying United 
 There's a party over here and everybody's invited 
 The headliners is Theodore and everybody's excited

 Fuck that, 'bout time we took it back to the block 
 The task force coming, I got crack in my sock 
 White Rock on the dinner plate, get cash, shit is hot 
 Smash whips on the Interstate, we dash on the cops 
 It's them dudes, drug slingers, 1-6-Ooh 
 Crime figure, rhyme spitter, his gun spit too 
 Call 'em Sex Pistols, ravishing, nigga, I'm Rick Rude 
 And ain't many mothafuckas could fit up in Rick's shoes 
 Man, listen, ice glisten, they love the life we living 
 That's a given, like football players love white women

 Swagger stuck on ya face like a New Jack tool

 I had my eyes squinched up tryin' to get through the fog 
 Pullin' up mad slow blunted, passin' police cars 
 I saw one two three bodies 
 Blood mixed with the rain ran through the gutter 
 That's the work of a tommy 
 But then I heard it was the work of a mami 
 Spanish chick bad, about five six, long hair, red Jag 
 Kinda bowlegged, Chanel sweatpants, she thick 
 She love her some pussy, don't really give a fuck about dick 
 That's when I got the call, yo Tone come to the shop 
 Some fire jumped, chill I'm about to pull in the lot 
 Lowered the tunes, pulled the Benz keys out the ignition 
 Brushed the ashes off my blazer then finished my Guinness 
 So then I walked in, seen the God shufflin' cards 
 Spades game, it's goin' down, he lost a couple of yards 
 Peace Lord, how your physical? 
 (Raekwon) 
 He upstate miserable 
 Stressed, doin' a thousand sets 
 But yo check the visuals 
 I'm at this hotel in Queens 
 Me and Charene getting' slow necked 
 That's live, I couldn't finish the bean 
 Gotta a phone call, seen the whole bitch face fall 
 Dope fiend look like the bitch swallowed an eight ball 
 They talkin' about killin' ya man's and them 
 That kid from Staten, his jewels is tough, his robes is satin 
 Yo that's my heart Tone; yeah yeah he killed the captain 
 What nationality nigga? The kid was Latin 
 It happened uptown, broad day, right in Manhattan 
 I was shoppin' with my home girl, Leona with acne? 
 But you know what, Flaco meets Lolita 
 Flew in, she from Medayeen, he deaded her uncle over them seventeen bricks 
 Niggas ain't slick, niggas is dicks 
 Y'all got beef for life now cause that bitch is a trick

 Ay yo fuck that, close the gate

 And lower the shade 
 Then a shot popped off

 Hit lil' bro in his fade 
 And then I see him dropped his clippers

 He dipped with the quickness 
 It was Lolita black down yo

 With four other bitches 
 He had a nasty hammer, fat ass

 Yo the clip was ninety shot

 So then I bugged out, ran up the steps

 Under the pinball game aimin'

 Was it Baby Phat, J.Lo, or straight Chanel 
 Her face belongs in a Luther video, Never Too Much 
 The way she smile, her face look pretty, though 
 Hands is soft, feet, no calysses 
 Her father owned six pallets in palaces 
 Laying out in New York, crush villas in Vegas 
 Greatest designer wear, son, she sport the latest 
 So I, pause the smooth talk, made her a drink 
 Blew her a kiss, as I sat down, she smiled and winked 
 Stood up, grabbed my hand, what up, slid ya boy to the bedroom 
 Popped the suitcase, I'm in the lead room 
 This check was loaded, equipped, with fifths 
 Porcelain handles with horse back kicks, whispered 
 ""You know what, Ghost, I do hits"" But niggas get fooled 
 By the sexyness, I'm a real gritty bitch

 Travelled the world, only one did jail time 
 Jade, her father's a judge, same nigga in the O.J. case 
 When he tried on the glove, but uh, in this scenario, four A.M. 
 The bars closed, now we at it again 
 Drunk nigga, come out I'm popping mad shit, he's past it 
 Nancy Drew, drew out her purse, the blue steel ratchet 
 Didn't even say shit, she blasted, barrel smoking 
 Shot the Henny out his hand for laughing 
 These are my bitches, Nancy and Jade 
 Natural born killas be letting they guns blaze... god damn!

 Look she tired of the same old basic, let's face it 
 This is how she wants to be laced, I'm raping it 
 Anywhere, I'm taking it, she loving how the gangsta flex 
 This is thug sex, Iking it, nasty talk 
 As she liking it, spanking it, she biting the sheets 
 She's a freak, my view from the embassy suites 
 Is off the beach shore, Dirty would've love you, mami 
 'You like it raw?' A tear drop, fucking you slow 
 I see your knees knock, your love is so sweet 
 If I switch beats, and hit you with angles, you might breathe 
 You know the Godbody make healthy wise seeds 
 You, plus a glass of weed, is all he need 
 You could travel so far, look, maybe book a flight to Mars 
 To escaping at, one forty two?

 Cost of living go up, I'm just go on vacation 
 Fresh oxygen tanks, got world renowned surgeons 
 Plush robes made from suede and knitted by virgins 
 First breath of the day can be my last 
 So I flash, give my niggaz some cash, I just pull out the stash 
 Buy a million dollar piece like I buy a pack of seeds 
 You buy OZ's of haze, I buy a forest full of trees

 Order that bottle of Louis the fifth and some Dom P 
 I got a bunch of chicks that love to get raunchy 
 See, Tone double-dipped and I nut like Flanders 
 Ask Tamia and Chevon, I got 'em both going bananas 
 Buying frosted bracelets, Louis Voutton duffles 
 French vanilla ice cream and hot apple pie truffles 
 Fly me, to Costa Rica, I got a crib on the beach 
 With underwater lights and surround sound speakers 
 Pet cheetahs, tiger sharks and dolphin feeders 
 Fly French maids, serving Grey Goose by the liters 
 Got Felecia and Taquesha, Crystal and Katie

 Five fake cans of blow to throw them off wit the flower

 Some call it bricks, some call it birds 
 How many niggaz get they lives tooken playing with shit, then catch a curb 
 You would go to jail 
 Get caught with this, niggaz'll grow to fail 
 Stop playing, pot slaying, baking soda and scales 
 They lived like brothers, word life, connects discovered 
 Most niggaz get hard, from fucking with them pipes and hustlers 
 Kilos is one thousand grams 
 You know your ammo better be heavy 'cause soon kids is coming in camo 
 Protect your land daddy, I'm an announcer 
 You get caught with an ounce and it's over 
 Matter 'fact they takin' you down, son 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Bricks, Tar caps, powder, cooked up crack 
 Phones is tapped over franklin's stacks 
 Kingpins put in bullpens, old connects get paro' 
 Break out of town when the Jakes take down the Pharaoh 
 Reason, He was moving that peruvian white 
 Blowing coolies into hoopties, slamming cuties and ice 
 Big heavy pots over hot stoves 
 Mayonnaise jars of water with rocks in them got my whole projects out of order 
 A Kilo is a thousand grams 
 Beige, gold, brown, dirty, fluffy, tan, extract oil cut from cuban plants 
 The chemist is brolic, pyrex scholars 
 Professors at war over raw, killing partners for a million dollars 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Some say a drug dealers destiny is reachin' the ki' 
 I'd rather be the man behind the door, supplying the streets 
 A hundred birds go out, looking like textbooks 
 When they wrapped and stuffed 
 Four days later straight cash, two million bucks 
 Strictly powder, no cut 
 Your coke is vialed in, what's up? 
 Y'all beefin over little shit, we sniff, the balance split up 
 In a plane or a penthouse, office or a warehouse 
 Tony's got it nice, we never heard of any big droughts 
 A Kilo is a thousand grams 
 A pile of sand is equivalent, to the eye 
 It's nice to have a thousand fans 
 Coke buyers, some be liars 
 Therefore, you check for wires 
 Dedicated dealers, during holidays we give 'em lighters 
 (Hook: Ghostface Killah) 
 Red tops, blue tops, green tops, yellow tops 
 Purple tops, beige tops, white tops, grey tops 
 Black tops, clear tops, gold tops, pink tops 
 Silver tops, tan tops, aqua tops, orange tops 
 Salt tops, long tops, short tops, 12 12's 
 58 58's, weed bags, ziplocks 
 Big rocks, coke spots, big glocks, one OT's 
 Crumbs chopped, hot pots, one plate, crack Spot 
 (Malice) 
 Thirteen getting it, pyrex whipping it 
 Like UPS, pack it up, shipping it 
 Whether base or sniffing it, I got your fix 
 The story's foretold like apocalypse 
 It was me Michael T.T., handing out freebies 
 Taking over blocks, telling niggas to be fee 
 Where big brother 'Vine'll leave the body in the street 
 Something kinda like how I be bodying the beat 
 We was 300 deep like the Persian soldiers 
 Word spread fast, we was serving boulders 
 Ten crack commandments, holy Moses 
 If you don't fit must equip icer toners 
 Never grip they holders, fingers to the snitchers 
 The New York niggas be taking all our bitches 
 But we be God damned if taking all our business 
 Duct tape, hard tops, C.S.I. forensics"

 This guy is a bulldozer with a wrecking ball attached 
 He'll leave a ring around your eye and tread marks on your back 
 He's an animal 
 He's hungry 
 You ain't been hungry, since ""Supreme Clientele"" 
 Remember what you first told me when I took ya in 
 You wanted to be a fighter (Yeah!) 
 You wanted to be a killer (New York Stand Up) 
 You wanted to be the Champ! (Got your boy in the booth nigga) 
 You ain't hungry

 While y'all stuck on Laffy Taffy 
 Wonderin' how y'all niggaz get past me

 Who want to battle the Don? 
 I'm James Bond in the Octagon with two razors

 I lost it, wild and raw before rap, I was gettin' it on 
 Took a fat nigga out in like 40secs 
 My gun get hard wit a 45 still erects and eagle on 
 Kangol hat slanted coconut bounce to Morocco 
 Guerilla medallions like Flavor Flav clock yo 
 Niggaz want me dead but they scared to step to me 
 Rip they guts out like a hysterectomy 
 When beef collide look on the flip by the penitentiary kite 
 Or get you bumped off from the inside 
 Jaws is hanging 
 Frauds is leftin they draws on the floor complaining 
 Bird ass nigga resemble Keenon Ivory Waynes 
 Stay in your place dirt born rappers get Shadow box for training? 
 Y'all still eatin bacon 
 (Spoken over the beat) 
 Think nobody can; don't give this nigga no statue give him death 
 I told y'all I wasn't going away 
 You had your shot no give me mine 
 Now why don't you tell these folks why you been ducking me, politics man 
 You think you going to keep me down 
 They don't want me to have the title 
 Because I'm not a puppet like that fool up there 
 Ask his woman she get more pipe from the plumber than in bed 
 I'm the Champ! 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 I like the deuce of diamonds cutting spades on a glass table 
 Half a mil on my left ankle 
 Terry cloth Guess shorts robes is comfortable 
 Bring me a nice bitch that means I'll fuck with you 
 My swagger is Mick Jaeger stones is rolling 
 Prestige is cut to it tis ? spark when weed went up 
 The Cocoa leaf is slightly damp 
 Sprouting in the backyard next to Gran duke tomato plants 
 And jets get charted marquee shit with the cars on it 
 They head and they earl to the toilet and vomit 
 Back East summer MC king since Cuban 
 Pretty Tone Iron Man and Bulletproof and Supreme 
 Proof and you double deuce in the jeans 
 My man ? was on the floor with the mother load both of them green

 You done slept on Tony 
 ""Tony Starks!"" ""Ironman!"" 
 You done slept on Tony 
 ""Yo, before that, I was getting it on"" 
 You done slept on Tony 
 ""Tony Starks!"" ""Ironman"" 
 You done slept on Tony 
 ""I was getting it, getting it, getting it on"" 
 Yo, when they kidnapped your boy, and forced me to do evil 
 I created an iron suit, to protect my people 
 Escaped, bound to be Ironman the great 
 The billionaire Tony Starks'll renew your fate 
 Built Stark Towers, throw the biggest events 
 Got liquid, armor, I can paint all dents 
 Keep a few bad chicks, I ain't your average hero 
 Movie premieres, catch me with the zam enginero 
 Six six eleven gold, playboy industrialist 
 Face of a ghost, mind of a technologist 
 Specialist, modern day speech slang therapist 
 Scecialize in weapons, I can blow off terrorists 
 So, so don't sleep big homey 
 Real recognize and I can see you phoneys 
 My weak heart can't take it, got a life long sentance 
 Boy genius grown up, and I fight with a vengeance 
 Yo, I got steel toe wallies when I glide on stage 
 And my heart gently weeps in an iron ribcage 
 Punctured by metals, replaced by elements 
 My enemies hunt it like a tusk on the elephant 
 Extraordinary, hiding my duel identities 
 Anthony Stark, call me Ton', the top pedigree 
 Multi-billionaire, military contractor 
 Crushing my opponents, with the strength of a compactor 
 Ex-factor, I turn liquids to metals 
 Water to wine, I turn dirt into rose petals 
 Greatest man walking, blow a bottle of Goose 
 Goldy plat iron armor, to Versace suits 
 I'm so elegant, scientifically intelligent 
 My lawyers won the case, I won't take the settlement 
 Money's irrelevant, I need heat to energize 
 We taking over the planet, Stark Enterprise 
 Once again, Tony Stark, infinite finesse 
 Stopped the planet, and destroyed an indestructable track"
144,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,Run (Remix),"(Intro: Ghostface Killah) 
 Pss... yo, yo, yo (yo son roll!) 
 Oh shit, yo, yo, run! 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Aiyo, I jumped from the 8th floor step, hit the ground 
 The pound fell, cops is coming 
 Runnin' through the pissy stairwells, I ain't hear nothin' 
 Buggin', only thing I remember was the bullshit summon 
 So I stopped at the 2nd floor, ran across, cracks is fallin' 
 My pockets is lean, clean when I vanished off 
 Took off, made track look easy 
 The walkie talkies them D-E-T's had, black, they was rated P.G. 
 Run, I will not give up, no, quick flag the car down 
 Take me to... Ghost here they come now! 
 Errr! Pull off quick, back up, hit the bitch, dog 
 Turned down Hill, light the Marley spliff 
 Run! I will not get bagged on the rock 
 Run! I seen what happened to Un, they bad with they cops 
 Run! They am' shit, plan shit, destroy evidence 
 Fuck a case, I'm not comin' home when I'm fifty six 
 Die with the heart of Scarface and take fifty licks 
 Before I let these crackers throw me and shit 
 Bounce if you a good kid, bounce, do the bird hop 
 Curse, swerve to get served, these cocksuckers got nerve 
 Heard I was killin' shit, they must got word 
 That I told the chief on Rich Port I don't wanna merge 
 (Raekwon) 
 I skated through the back of the building, hit the steps up 
 Ran up in Kay crib, lay daddy rest 
 I had to break free, police on me and they FB's 
 Yelling ""I think his name Lex, that's his aunt, freeze"" 
 That's when I hit the window, indo' coming out the back room 
 Boom, Pretty and his man, Black Caesar 
 Damn, they saw me and they bustin' at me 
 Cab just missed me, plus them goochie frames, foul, that's six fifty 
 Stop back at suite, them leaf defense slid through my man garden 
 Yelled out 'pardon', kept it moving, peace 
 Build be gone, ain't no honor amongst thieves 
 Please, plus they heard I'm getting parmagane cheese 
 And I won't stop moving till the metal dig me 
 Say word, yo, make 'em work for it, young rookie, y'all need me 
 That's when it is, what it is, if it's that or the cup 
 But in the ill gangstas book what they niggas do is 
 (Chorus: Ghostface Killah) 
 Run! If you sell drugs in the school zone 
 Run! If you gettin' chased with no shoes on 
 Run! Fuck that! Run! Cops got, guns! 
 They givin' out life like by the tons 
 Run! If you ain't do shit, you it 
 That next felony, nigga, it's like three zip 
 So, run! Hop fences, jump over benches! 
 When you see me comin' get the fuck out the entrance! 
 Run! Fuck that! Run! Cops got guns! 
 (Interlude: Jadakiss (Ghostface Killah)) 
 Ah-hah! I might gotta take my shirt off (yeah, kid...) 
 I like that one (uh-huh, go in, go in!) 
 (Jadakiss) 
 Yo, uh, it's Task Force Tuesday, the NARCS is in the black car 
 I got five hundred, hundred packs in my backyard 
 Clear twelve-twelve's, that look like stuff shells 
 I'm cuttin' niggas throats on the sails, while they puff L's 
 Don't leave nothin' unbagged, shave everything 
 I learned from the O.G.'s to save everything (to save everything) 
 They come by one more time, they gon' hop out 
 They two deep, and one is a bitch, she gettin' knocked out 
 Then I can get rid of the pack 
 But I just copped this pretty chrome thing, so I'm dippin' with that 
 Uh, down-shiftin' on 'em like I got gears on me 
 (Run!) Besides that, I got about 5 years on me 
 (Run!) Scared to death, runnin' like I got bears on me 
 (Run!) My Timb's start feelin' like they Nike Air's on me 
 (Run!) It's hard for me to slow down, it's like I'm on the Throughway 
 My belt's in the crib on the floor by my two-way 
 Now I'm try'nna hold my hammer up, and my pants too 
 If they don't kill me, they gon' give me a number I can't do 
 Rather it be the streets, then jail where I die at 
 And I'm ashmatic, so I'm lookin' for somewhere to hide at 
 But they too close, and I got this new toast 
 'Magine if I would have let off a shot or two, you know what I gotta do 
 (Freeway) 
 Free hold east coast whole, boxing the Philly down 
 Down to Dela', when y'all rarely toting the milli round 
 I bring the milli to ya house, I was just down south 
 Carolina had the milli down there 
 Pearl Beach had the heater in reach, and four freaks 
 In Hooters, I made 'em lose it when they heard freedom of speech 
 Told them freaks that I gotta run, I'm on the run 
 But they tried to make me stay, they showed me two hooters a piece 
 I stayed for a second but you know I gotta skate 
 It's like a race, cops chase me, I'm chasing the moon 
 Before I left the premise, saw two more bitches 
 They told me they was witches, told me hop on they broom 
 I did, and then we went zoom 
 Don't you know them witches got me outtie wit the quickness 
 I'm buggin', I'm trippin' in reality I'm skitzin' 
 The cops got me trapped in the Audi wit the Smith & 
 (Interlude: Lil Wayne) 
 D-Boy, yeah, Birdman Jr. in ya building, people 
 I'mma let you know how it go on my side of the mountain, whoadie 
 (Lil Wayne) 
 It's sure about does that you heard me 
 And I dropped in effect since 9/11 
 I'm on the avenue with nines, elevens, I'm a two times felon 
 That's why I keep the top up, on my 9-11 
 Pele, in New Orleans, ain't got no Rico law 
 So I keep that heat in the car, but they don't know 
 I had that 'dro in the seat of the car 
 But it's hot right now, so you can see me tomorrow 
 Ay, Ghostface, the youngins on the block duckin' blue and red lights 
 While your boy bypassing fare light 
 But if them cock suckers ever get me dead right 
 Three hots and the cops swallow weed and a knife, right? 
 I speed at night, take it easy in the day 
 Go hard wit the dough, take it easy wit the yae 
 Yup, Lil' Weezy, I get my loot up 
 But at the pull up, come, I say my crew run run, boy"

 (Chorus: Ghostface Killah) 
 Tell your crew to be easy, niggaz run around 
 With them fake frowns, sell 'em on eBay 
 Get word to the DJ, tell 'em Staten Island's 
 In the house, put the record on replay 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Colorful kicks and my closet like Baskin-Robbins 
 Central Park killings, stab niggas while they jogging 
 No shirt on, whilin' like I sniffed the eight 
 At the ball game, jumped down and stole the base 
 Some muthafuckas said it was bass 
 Silly me, thought it was a 12 by 12 inch Colombian snowflake 
 Mob Jacob slow cut 8 six, the semi have 
 Niggas running like Forrest when he broke his braces, pa 
 Scold a nigga like a pile of hot chocolate 
 Before I eat her, I belong on a bitch cartridge 
 Niggas kill me potraying that hard shit 
 Shove his face in the dirt like an ostrich 
 On some mob shit, no talking, like we resolve shit 
 Stretch a nigga out like an enlarged dick 
 That's one for you, one-two for me 
 I'm hoggin' and shit, y'all muthafuckas best to be easy

 The pyroclastic flow, you know the side, bitch 
 You know the side, bitch, huh, ah

 Fuck you, if you don't think I get money 
 I get it all day, standing in the hallway 
 On broadway, bitches wanna call Shea 
 Over to the car, but hoe, I'm the superstar 
 Get your ass out, fuck if you pass out 
 Walk over to ya man, pull the cash out 
 Put it in my hand, watch a nigga mash out 
 Walk back to your car, with your ass out 
 Fuck a ghostwriter, nigga down wit Ghostface 
 I'm a killa, wit that chrome in ya face 
 Blow ya face back, turn you into a ghost 
 Hit you like Kenny hit Casper on the post 
 West coast, ya hoe, ya gotta love it 
 It's Ice Cube, yeah, bitch, I got it covered 
 I got a movie for ya kids, a dick for your bitch 
 A four-five slug for your wig 
 They wanna put me out the league like Terrell 
 Till they CD smokin' double barrels 
 Ice Cube, will fuck off movie money 
 Then serve you on the mic, and make whitey feel funny

 They try to save you, sware to God, I hit the nurse up 
 Like ""Nah, doc, he look better in a herse truck"" 
 I tried to ignore it, his people saw it 
 I ain't the type of dude you go to war with 
 My polo gun yo, will crack the floor shit 
 When the heat's on, you know I draw it

146,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,Ghostface X-Mas,"Holy Jesus, I gotta drop all these toys off 
 Mrs. Claus, Mrs. Claus, bring me my robe and my slippers I gotta go! 
 Smell the pinetrees in the air, sleigh bells are ringing 
 Toy stores are out of control, and kids singing 
 That night before Christmas, dashing through the snow 
 Rudolph the Reindeer, red nose that glow 
 It's all about the candy canes and Christmas list 
 North Pole and that chubby jolly old Saint Nick 
 The little elves getting busy, in Santa workshop 
 And how gingerbread men keep they buttons on top 
 Wooden soldiers and chestnuts, roasting like marshmallows 
 Goodfellas, chocolate pudding pops and Jell-O's 
 It's the gift, the cookies and milk on the mantle 
 The mistletoe, that scent from that peppermint candles 
 That warm French vanilla, mean coat with zippers 
 Bearskin robe dragon with Versace slippers 
 Around the fireplace we breathe, shirts are short sleeve 
 We stayin' up all night on Christmas Eve 
 It's the season for sharing, season of the gift 
 Season for snow, it's December 25th 
 That time of the year, we dress like Saint Nick 
 Stirring whip cream into that hot cup of Quick 
 It's the season for sharing, season of the gift 
 Season for snow, it's December 25th 
 That time of the year, we surprise all the kids 
 Buy gifts for your loved ones and diamonds for ya wiz 
 I see snowmen, snowflakes, cinnamon cakes 
 Sisters and brothers, sliding down garbage can covers 
 Snowball fights, eggnog splashed with Hennessey 
 Bet Christmas is Christmas from New York to Tennessee 
 The Kris Kringles, the Jingling Babies 
 All them late nights wrapping gifts, driving you crazy 
 And Jack Frost is outside, freezing it up 
 Got the hood and the goose just to loosen you up 
 And all the homes is all lit with some many lights 
 See the trees through the windows, glittered up at night 
 Gingerbread house, bumping that Jingle Bell Rock 
 And all them little bad kids get coal in they socks 
 Ghost knows when you be sleeping 
 And Ghost knows when you are awake 
 And I know if you been bad or good 
 So be good for old Ghostface 
 Hahahaha, we made it, wish you all a Merry Christmas 
 And a Happy New Year, hahahaha 
 And to all a good night, good night to all 
 To Staten Island, hahah, nah, cut it, cut it off, son"
147,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,Not Your Average Girl,"From the blocking, to the dropping 
 I need a girl that's stacking and popping 
 When I come in late she's not clocking 
 Not in the crib throwing 'round pots and 
 Nice girl, that's clean, that was raised to cook 
 Be on the couch chilling, shorts on, reading a book 
 Biting on a pen, thin glasses on 
 French type frames by Yves Saint Laurent 
 Say hey pretty mama, do you fit the bill? 
 Do you got what it take for you to fit in my wheel? 
 Would you bust that steel if niggas came to kill me 
 Protect that safe, baby, dag that's filthy 
 Whoa, somebody let her know up in here 
 He like Papa Smurf, I'm like Papa Bear 
 I'm just looking for a queen so I can rock her ear 
 Tell her P. Tone in here I got her locked this year 
 I'm not your average girl, I be your Bonnie right beside you 
 No need to worry, boo, I got you, yeah 
 I'm not your average girl, see me without you is unlikely 
 Them other bitches they not like me 
 You can have keys to the boat, money follow me 
 I got the cheese and the yolk, plus the juice 
 That's fresh squeeze with the pulp, mama got a big butt 
 Tiffany chain, the stones freeze in the throat 
 Love to hold my hand, stepping off planes from D.R. 
 Luggage with a big black tan 
 Whatcha gonna do? You or him, me or you? 
 Fucking with him you look mad pitiful 
 Boo, I'm not the type that be slobbing down hoochies 
 Looking at these hoes, eyes low like Droopy 
 Tugging on my jacket 'til the lights come on 
 We run trains on them bitches never ice they arm 
 That's a no, no, chicken heads looking for a come up 
 In the club oh my God, now they wanna run up 
 Nagging 'til the sun up, shut up, I'm not a double-up, boo 
 Go get your feet done, your toes 'cause they knuckles up

 No need to worry, boo, I got you, yeah 
 I'm not your average girl, see me without you is unlikely

 Baby, baby, don't waste your towel 
 Looking any further 'cause the girl is ours 
 Holds it down for you, any place, any time 
 You already know, I'm the one, yeah, I'm that 
 Fly girl, rider, just say the word 
 Anything pop off, it's us against the world 
 Such a hood girl with that dirty loving 
 That'll make your toes curl 
 Yo, relax and chill analyze the story 
 Love your boy Tone got mass appeal 
 All them other little players ain't as half as real 
 They just wanna get up in you like Mass and Gill 
 But me I need a wisdom play it like wifey 
 Well mannered understand the kid and not bite me 
 All my real ladies put your hands up 
 Holla at your boy if you ain't a groupie right now stand up

148,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,Do Over,"This is a story of a player from the Island 
 That lost his way, such a price to pay 
 To kiss those girls and make them cry 
 Kiss those girls and make them cry 
 To love, to lose, to plead for a do over 
 A do over, give me a do over, I want a do over 
 It's that Radio Raheem and Ghostface Killah 
 If you know I was out of line, I miss you like all the time 
 And if you don't wanna see me, fine 
 A good girl's hard to find, so maybe in due time 
 Can I get a do over? Can I get a do over? 
 Aiyo, I used to get a threesome, every other weekend 
 Cheated on my girl 'til we nearly stopped speaking 
 She broke down and cried and it hurts so bad 
 Her friends went and told her I was a brand new dad 
 Of course, she knows now, I ain't used no bag 
 My excuses, I couldn't cum like that 
 She warned me of days like this, if this should happen 
 She'll be out and we'll be the ones sharing the napkin 
 Silly dilly me, didn't follow the instructions 
 Don't bring nothing home, I don't wanna hear nothing 
 But brought to the world 
 Innocent, two month old little girl 
 But what am I to do? Yo, I lost my boo 
 It's like being kicked out the group and lost my crew 
 Throwing the baby up to someone I hardly knew 
 Nah, that shit don't add up, what am I to do, yo, I lost my jewel 
 If you know I was out of line, I miss you like all the time 
 And if you don't wanna see me, fine 
 A good girl's hard to find, so maybe in due time 
 Can I get a do over? Can I get a do over? 
 Aiyo, aiyo, aiyo, I wrote this right here on the bus to Riker's 
 Right next to the thieves, the cons, the lifers 
 For mad years, you held you down, I'ma overwhelmed in pain 
 And the worst time to leave you, now 
 I'm sorry, please forgive me, the streets caught me 
 I appreciate your concern and support for me 
 Most important your honesty and trust, your heart's incredible 
 This the truth spilling out of my guts 
 If I would of took the chance to see 
 What was place right in front of my face for sure nine out of ten times 
 My actions wouldn't allow me to be so naive 
 And blind to carry out these mistakes 
 I'm cheating, running around, blasting my gun 
 For me my rep on the streets like touching a son 
 You're like a fingerprint, I never find a match like you 
 Thanks for your patience you find a man I hope it's true 
 If you know I was out of line, I miss you like all the time 
 And if you don't wanna see me, fine 
 A good girl's hard to find, so maybe in due time 
 Can I get a do over? Can I get a do over? Radio Raheem, yeah 
 She was screaming out the window, I was walking up the block 
 Throwing out my Timbos and all my clothes 
 She said, if my apologies 
 She said, the lost won't fit those 
 And I said, baby, now let me explain 
 I know I had fucked up, it was a one time thing 
 So take all the time you need in this life 
 And if you let me do it over I promise to do it right 
 If you know I was out of line, I miss you like all the time 
 And if you don't wanna see me, fine 
 A good girl's hard to find, so maybe in due time 
 Can I get a do over? Can I get a do over? 
 Hello baby, I'm sorry for everything that just been going on lately 
 You know, I've kinda been stressed out 
 I've been thinking about the things I did to you lately and 
 Not listening when you was telling me to chill 
 Now I wind up in here, it's like, you remember, listen boo, listen 
 The way you rub my face, the way you talk to me 
 The way you look at me, I know ain't no girl in the world 
 Gon' ever give me that like the way you gave it to me 
 So right now I'm pleading and this is my word on everything 
 I'm on my knees, babe, just take me back, give me one chance 
 I'm asking for a do over"

 Walking around with my head hung down 
 I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely 
 And don't be surprised if you see me on the train 
 Like a homeless man who's lost his way 
 I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely 
 On this cold pavement I feel like laying 
 In the middle of the street and just saying 
 I can't take it, I won't make it 
 Too much weight on my shoulders and my kids are getting older 
 For so long I've been so strong 
 I've been crying all week since you've been gone 
 And as the tears roll out my eyes 
 Another happy young couples walks by 
 Don't be surprised when you see me 'round town 
 Walking around with my head hung down 
 I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely 
 And don't be surprised if you see me on the train 
 Like a homeless man who's lost his way 
 I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely 
 Someone been sleeping in my bed, eating my food 
 Using my soap, laying up in my pool 
 Walking around in his boxers like every thing's cool 
 Gassing my chick for the whip dropping her off at school 
 Under my covers and changing my channels 
 Playing my CD's in my robes, another man's burning my candles 
 My cologne's half way gone, a fake don my wiz fell for 
 Now she strolls the park under his arm 
 This is my fault, I've never thought I'd see this coming 
 From the outside bugging with crazy knots in my stomach 
 Say what goes around, comes around, now I know it now 
 Now I'm the fool looking in while it's going down 
 If somebody would of told me I might be lonely 
 Now it's on me, baby call me please

 Like a homeless man who's lost his way 
 I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely 
 Now he's getting all my kisses, stroking my loving 
 That 'posed to be me but I was too stupid and stubborn 
 Like a piece of rope I let it go, my mother said it so 
 You better straighten up don't act like you didn't know 
 Her birthday came, heard she was hugged up wearing his chain 
 Play in the sky box at some bullshit Knick game 
 My son said, daddy, he like his eggs well done 
 And he kinda cool, mommy happy, I can't front 
 He take us on trips and clothes shopping, most of the time 
 We watch flicks on your surround sound, he watch boxing 
 You better go beg or something before she go love him 
 He's taking your spot 'cause you was dissing mommy you bugging 
 They don't argue, he sent her flowers for no reason 
 She's cheesing, I'm wishing you could come back and see this 
 Don't be surprised when you see me 'round town 
 Walking around with my head hung down 
 I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely

 In your thigh highs, word up and I'ma stop at the adult store 
 And get one of them little screaming O's

 Stagger Lee swine could you stay mine pretty please? 
 I'm begging you, girl but time fly since 2 o'clock, boom 
 I turn around it's like 12 on the dot 
 What am I to do? Your steeze got a live nigga wanting you 
 Around the way girl, that's why I don't mind sporting you 
 Someone who loves you, only half as much as I do 
 Only half as much as I do 
 Aiyo, aiyo, he don't really love you like I do 
 Kiss your feet, make love to you like I do 
 Wake you up, in the night tank and surprise you 
 Cross my heart, swear, put my hand on the bible 
 I'm not a cold blooded killa, baby, I cry to 
 The best thing for me is when I'm laying beside you 
 Turn you over, open up, get up inside you 
 He a woman beater no doubt and he lies too 
 Stay, a little longer 
 I know you have to go home to him 
 When you leave I get aggy, I don't know how to act 
 The reality settle with a punch and a smack 
 When I know that you with him you ain't calling me back 
 It be that thing down there that got me way off track 
 Someone who loves you 
 Only half as much as I do 
 If it's like that, fuck that nigga, he a clown 
 He don't know what he got, let that bastard suffer 
 I sent you roses, Donna Karen bags from Paris 
 He can't match my one, son, he'll be embarrassed 
 Stay a little longer 
 I know you have to go home to him 
 Aiyo, baby, don't leave 'cause the club is popping 
 We got grandma yay, plus the tunes is knocking 
 On the dance floor, I'm sweating my ass off 
 Imagining us in deep lust how you look with your pants off 
 My one-two step, your dress is so spun 
 And your neck smell good, look cute when you chewing your gum and 
 From the womb to the tomb you're blessed with a killa walk 
 You don't have to give me none, it's aight, we'll talk 
 Someone who loves you 
 Only half as much as I do"
153,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,Paragraphs Of Love,"Her face glow like I was exposed to sunlight 
 She's happy, her hair, toes and nails is dumb right 
 The smell of her fragrance, baffled my nostrils 
 I can see through her eyes, she's feeding on in the possible 
 She blushes as I kept splashing her compliments 
 Polite thank yous is all around she crush the mints 
 Developments, smooth keys from the piano 
 Changed the mood like we changed the channel 
 This is art Picasso I got him beat in the flesh 
 I'm staring at beauty Nefertiti heaven bone in the chest 
 Yes, everywhere she step went off like a flare gun 
 Stilettos on parquet floors 
 Miss thing, she's a fierce one, two and three 
 Bad little mama she built like Alicia Keys 
 No facade, her strut is hard, based on books by 
 Intelligent jail crooks writing to let the time fly 
 She dropped the bracelet, I kneeled down 
 Prestigious gentleman, with my right hand I picked it up 
 I stood up, to the cutest eyelashes as I gave her her jewels back 
 Miss thing started rubbing her gut 
 Excuse me are you pregnant? Not to be rude 
 But if it means anything I can get you some food 
 Cheese crackers, in the back there's sauteed shrimp 
 Nah, I never free lumps, I'll be as big as a blimp 
 See my due date is January my first and it's kinda scary 
 It's only June, in Christmas I'll be getting married 
 And I'm happy, excuse me, what's your name? 
 Tone Starks, peace, I'm Gabby 
 Well, I gotta go my husband is waiting 
 But before I go can I give you one last statement 
 You the most beautifullest queen I ever seen 
 And I would love to have a thing like you on my team, you take care 
 Any other day I would of just let you, pass me by 
 'Cause I see you got situations and I've got mine 
 But baby it's okay, it's alright, I'm not gonna let you pass me by 
 'Cause this was love at first sight 
 'Cause this was love at first sight, it's okay 
 You can tell he must be on a mission 
 Because my heart has made it's decision 
 As soon as you stepped in my peripheral vision 
 I fell in love, sweet love 
 And no infatuated 3D glasses to see 
 That you're the one I need 
 And the situation don't matter to me 
 'Cause this is love, it gotta be love, love at first sight 
 Any other day I would of just let you, pass me by 
 'Cause I see you got situations and I've got mine 
 But baby it's okay, it's alright, I'm not gonna let you pass me by 
 'Cause this was love at first sight 
 'Cause this was love at first sight, it's okay 
 Any other day I would of just let you, pass me by 
 'Cause I see you got situations and I've got mine 
 But baby it's okay, it's alright, I'm not gonna let you pass me by

154,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,Guest House,"In the crib on this rainy day, I'm chilling 
 Glass pianos and Portuguese drapes, hang from the ceiling 
 Persian rugs, Moroccan sofas 
 I walk to the house in Paisley robes and Ferragamo loafers 
 And Iron Chef just season the salmon 
 It's coming down pouring, he watching BBC, eating a salad 
 I'm on the couch hitting the chalice 
 Checking my textes and out of nowhere, my dick is hard as a callus 
 I stood up, pulled back my sleeve, checked my watch 
 Where the, fuck is my wife, it's 12 o'clock on the dot 
 Very impatient, I'm getting nervous can't stop pacing 
 My heart's racing, her Nextel don't get no service 
 Damn, all this over a gallon of milk 
 Something happened to her, somebody wig'll get peeled 
 Okay, let me calm down, maybe she at Keeba house 
 Her birthday's today, we both bought her jeans and a blouse 
 Since 7 o'clock, she been gone for hours 
 Jetted up the steps to the master suite, checked the shower 
 Nope, all that is there is towels and soap 
 Stomach is nauseous, caught a big lump in my throat 
 Found a phone book with mad names, looked down 
 Bow, there go Keeba tying my shoes, I put the bitch on speaker 
 And bluntly addressed her, ""Where's my girl?"" 
 Yeah, she ain't out here 
 Last time I seen her, Ghost, she beat it on an old nigga 
 Yo, Keeba stop playing, yo, nah, we took a shot of Henn' 
 Lately she work out by 10, I told her, bitch, buy a Benz 
 Or even shot a car, I'm getting me some Advil 
 Show these motherfuckers, how Keeba love to drive stick 
 I snatched up my raincoat, the grass was soaked 
 Under the bed in the guest house, where I keep my toast 
 I yelled to the Chef, yo, ""Watch for Kayla 
 Check the pool and the bowling alley 
 If anything, just hit my cellular"" 
 Hopped in the go cart, the yard is dark, I'm bugging 
 Few feet from the guest house is where I parked 
 Hope she's okay is what I say in my heart 
 But something don't feel right, so is what I'm saying to God 
 As I got closer something ain't kosher 
 I heard a bunch of squeaky sounds from the house 
 I don't think I'm suppose to is this the end of the Starks regime? 
 Let me find out somebody on my ground, yo is pounding my queen 
 Yo, I'ma kill ya, hold on 'cause 
 Baby, let me explain, you overreacting, that's not what it was 
 Shut the fuck up, you got caught moaning with your legs up 
 Eyes all red, what did y'all just blaze up? 
 Then froze for a sec, so I dipped quick, lift the mattress 
 Aimed the biscuit at both of them bastards 
 What y'all excuse now, yo 'cause, she said she live with her pop 
 Her dude mad strict that's why we up in the spot 
 And yo this little trick of yours bought me a ten G watch 
 He reached down for his drawers, that's when I let off a shot 
 Back the fuck up, snatched his covers 
 Had 'em looking like the black Adam and Eve, some sinful lovers 
 Chill, Tone, put the gun down, how you know my name, son? 
 Hold on, let me explain, yo y'all two is done 
 Just let me put my drawers, get dressed, before I get rocked 
 'Cause real talk, is looking like you tryna let off that glock 
 Yeah, you right, you look familiar, you put my cable in, right? 
 The FiOS nigga and you fucking my wife 
 Yeah, I put that cable in, nigga, we both got caught 
 And she a triflyn ass chick, don't act like it's all my fault 
 Baby, no, mind your business 
 Now Kayla, don't stop him, let the sucker do what he do 
 He touch me and he finished 
 What nigga, hold that, eat it 
 Oh shit, what the fuck, you forgot your drawers 
 And your little tools, nigga 
 You FiOS mustache wearing muthafucka 
 Fuck you, nigga, I got you nigga 
 I'mma see you nigga, fucker, fuck 
 That's why you dive out the window 
 On some Jim Kelly, shit, nigga, fuck that"

 And got up you start tonguing me down 
 Butterflies ran across my stomach 
 Didn't wanna put the fire out 'cause goddamn, I love it 
 Moved the basket out the way, cleared the table 
 Laid you down, my mouth slid past your navel 
 Your feet had knocked over the Clorox bleach 
 Held my head closer to you when my tongue got deep 
 I'm saying we both of those, this how I feel 
 If you don't want a part of me, it's no big deal 
 But ma, I'm not here to game you, babe, I'm going on vibes

 Yo, I love you so much, so let me pay you homage 
 And if you do, yo I promise never break a promise 
 So can I give you the honors my little Pocahontas?

 You like a Zales Diamond in the window, right on display 
 You just a shining, precised in every curve you cut 
 And for your daddy, yo, you never have to tuck in your gut

 Plus let me show my crunches to burn it off 
 Just lay right on your back and let me do my love dance 
 I pop it to the left, I pop it to the right, I get it all night, come on

 Put them dudes straight up and check 'cause the queen is mine

 We can be broke, holes in our coat even still we shine 
 We got each other through the bad and the best of time 
 Last forever, last forever 
 Yo, yo, I'm lost in love, with nowhere to go 
 She says I'm a pain in the ass, boy, get to the store 
 She can say that 'cause we best friends, we play together 
 She carry my left rib, therefore we pray together 
 Bury me on top of her in our graves together 
 'Cause when she feel pain, I know how to make it better 
 Talks, some long walks, communication in parks 
 Understand what she's going through, our listen was smarts 
 Especially when she's on her friend I be hoping it leave 
 I have to bite my tongue just to keep from arguing 
 Six days of that is like who let the monster in 
 After it's finished then I can get on top again 
 Shorty girl's my oxygen, never catch her gossiping 
 Look it y'all, this my flower, she gon' keep on blossoming 
 Long as she is mine and I am her, we gon' ride the wind 
 This lady here is all for me, I never have to lock her in 
 Them other chicks must hail to the queen as I 
 Put them dudes straight up and check 'cause the queen is mine

 Big boats, thick ropes, ostrich purses 
 Snakeskin boots, Jared Jewelers, the mink cost mad loot 
 Ski trips, resorts, close your eyes, baby, make a wish 
 Blow your cake out, earrings is snowflaked out 
 Will you marry me? Will you carry me? 
 Through rain, hail, sleet and snow, don't say no, you'll embarrass me

 Yeah baby, let's do it 
 Oh shit, look at miss thing, you done grew into a stallion 
 Girl and still don't got no ring? 
 Back then, you was a lot younger, now you older 
 Broke my heart on what you had in the stroller 
 On the low, that could have been me, huggie down 
 Fly and handsome, talk about little Starsky 
 With little Barkley's, little car seat 
 Two years later here comes little Sharneese 
 I'm saying, are you involved, what's up with you? 
 And where homeboy at? Oh word, y'all through? 
 Eff him, you know how I do, when I come through 
 Shut the whole block down like I got something to prove 
 But um, besides the lane, you look the same 
 Still blowing beauty marks, sitting under your bang 
 Ankle bracelets that Donna Kay shit 
 I saw one rope for your throat, yo, it cost about 8 chips 
 Hoodrats, they be wearing that fake shit 
 Like her, she wear the same bag, like it ain't shit 
 Pardon me, excuse my French

 All in our business they wanna be nosey 
 He's with her, gonna be all in the streets like a Jeep tomorrow 
 Don't worry, let's breeze the bar 
 And in case I ain't tell you those jeans is hard 
 And those is the snitches, mean mugging, can't fight 
 Run into the police, fuck them niggas 
 I pull out like a tooth when the back is rotten 
 Finish 'em off like your menstrual after you spotting 
 Ghost can't complain, 5'6"", swinging those hips 
 And my miss got me wanting to sing 
 Walking down the street, watching ladies 
 I go by watching you, watching you 
 I want you like if I ain't got nothing to do 
 He's a goner, hey, you just say the word, baby girl, I'm on that 
 Hey, anything you need, anything you want, want, hey, hey 
 'Cause he don't know I gotcha, anything you need, I gotcha 
 Ooh, baby girl, I gotcha

 Hey, anything you need, anything you want, want, hey, hey 
 'Cause he don't know I gotcha, anything you need, I gotcha 
 Ooh, baby girl, I gotcha 
 He's a goner 
 Somebody better call the cops 
 'Cause if that thing cock back it's gon' pop 
 Once me stop moving it ain't gon' stop 
 Whatever that girl wants you know she got shopping 
 Somebody better check the swag 
 We rack up and never check the tags 
 We just stuffed it all in the bag 
 Oh, you mad? Well, too bad 
 He's a goner, hey, you just say the word, baby girl, I'm on that 
 Hey, anything you need, anything you want, want, hey, hey

 (Chorus: Ne-Yo) 
 Come through the block, in the brand new Benz, 
 Knowing that me and that nigga ain't friends, 
 (Ok girl) Yeah, what I did was wack 
 But you don't get a nigga back like that. 
 Flossin' around, when I'm up in these streets, 
 Knowing that me and that nigga got beef,

 But you don't get your nigga back like that, no 
 (Verse 1: Kanye West) 
 Pardon me if I lost my voice

 The part, that bitch been on my mind all week. 
 But back to this mack loss chick, your waist thick 
 How you have everything in this world and waste it? 
 Quince told me it'll be okay, 
 I'm so sick like Ne-Yo say, I'm laid back like neo soul, 
 I holla back at this Creole hoe, 
 She from the N.O. but she never told me N-O so 
 We hit the spot to chill, where the food get grilled, 
 She order the Kobe beef like Shaquille O'Neal 
 Second I walked in the whole room got still 
 I don't know how to put this but I'm kind of a big deal. 
 And she conceited, she got a reason 
 She gotta her hair did, she got her weave in 
 And I'ma sweat that out by the evening 
 You? I don't sweat that now I gotta new...

 First one to put you up 6 weeks in the resident Hilton, 
 Mink coats, colourful stones and big stacks 
 Yeah I was fucking, but you don't get me back like that 
 Causing me grief, you know me and homie had beef, 
 Now you got me losing my mind out up in these streets 
 You flamingo, showing your true colours, 
 Heard y'all was ducking down low when you seen my brothers 
 But it's all good I move from ex to next, 
 I got the baddest little chick to sign off of the cheques, 
 Fat bubble, her body's one of the best 
 But I don't need to say nothing just ask Kanye West 
 She's eye candy, smoother than Godiva chocolate 
 Now you're mad 'cause you played yourself, it's your fault chick

 Shot threw the heart the girl got me, 
 Shot threw the block with him shot gun, 
 He lucky I ain't stop, copped the shotgun 
 Killer type cat, better be glad I'm not one. 
 Had a couple stars out in my sky, 
 You was my moon and my sunshine, 
 Dude ain't even fly - he's just some guy 
 You played yourself I'm young, peace, one

 (Outro: Ghostface Killah) 
 I'm a good dude, you see... yeah... 
 Females out there that wanna be, 
 Acting like they getting they little revenge off 
 Taking it further than what it really is 
 You know what I mean, playing yourself... 
 You know what I mean... this is Don status, girl 
 You will have to hold that now... 
 Word up, and when I see money, 
 I'm gonna hang him upside down and saw him,

 Me and dog for life yo! 
 Yeah, tattoo on your back and all that"

 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Take my hands out my pockets you can see my thumbs 
 Both of them turned green, from countin' the ones 
 Memorized by the glory, word life 
 Cut off niggaz who killed Bill but couldn't do nuttin for me 
 Shout 'em out every once in the blue and kid too 
 I never rocked with, laws they keep away we cool 
 I devised my own stimulus, plan I'm niggarish 
 I'm tired of eatin those crumbs and black licorice 
 The frame of mind so {?} like cleansin the mic 
 Let the imam pray over my head and wash 
 Thoughts, sterilized, purified, Godly 
 Watch us gift men and fetch the green like barley 
 If that shit happen I'll feed his whole army 
 Talkin' 'bout the angels and peeps in Somali 
 Try to stay humble, and swallow my pride 
 In God I trust, now talk about the ones on your five 
 Crisp dollar billin, catch me in a little hut in Beneen 
 Village style, feedin the children 
 Big pots of jasmine tea with Mandela 
 Africans chantin me on like Coachella 
 Ghostface bom ba ye, kumbiya my Lord 
 My death day, 24 karat tomb I lay 
 Wishin they could bury me, next to the prophets 
 Nabi, Lut, Is'haq, Musa, Harun, Muhammad 
 Ibrahim 
 ""Am I a good man?"" (I don't know) 
 ""Am I a fool?"" (We'll see) 
 (Killah Priest) 
 The Lord takes me, gathering speeds before winds 
 High currents, {?} places we formin wings 
 Kings offering, thrones was there 
 Man with the 7 crowns on his dome was near 
 Feet walked over rose petals, song from the ghetto 
 Face froze in gold like the pharaoh 
 A dawn in glory, robe of light, a powerful cherub 
 As he passed the path, white doves cost the eyes of thugs 
 Eternal heartbeat, in the dark fire in his blood 
 700 books were opened 
 It breaks to right, they threw the crooks in the ocean 
 Scared, brass hair like it grew from goatskin 
 The chosen has spoken, tablets were broken 
 The smoke hand grabs an omen 
 Gravity grabbin me gradually draggin me through hell's cavity 
 This is blasphemy, I fell where the jackals be 
 God felt bad for me but cast me into Caspain Sea 
 Satan draggin his key, Wu-Family's the faculty 
 K.P., K.P. 
 ""Am I a good man? Am I a fool? 
 ""Am I?"" 
 (GZA) 
 He used to sling in the stairwell 
 Fast to put the rap on thinking cap, ignite your hair gel 
 No such thing as a fair sale 
 He'll put the bullet out same day, delivery airmail 
 And on this level a thug'll sell you garbage 
 No refund, the only exchange from the cartridge 
 Where the youths is kept comin' back with they life earnings 
 Ready to make a deal, soul and pipe burning 
 The outcome tragic, household dramatic 
 Living rooms to {?}, basements to attics 
 Support from the B, hit the courts from a fiend 
 Who betrayed one, who had lit the torch for his team 
 So they sent him gifts, body parts per diem 
 In a box that held prints but too dark to see 'em"

 The Bad bitch keep the tool in her bible 
 Quick to murder her rivals and her pops was a gangsta Disciple 
 He Killed about a thousand Vice Lords guns and knife wars 
 The feds came for him so he slid to the 9th ward 
 Down in the N.O. 
 And right before he left he wrote his daughter a memo left stacks in a Benz-o 
 It got hot niggas selling giving out the info 
 He paranoid every 20 seconds out the window 
 Blow it into limbo he spazzed on Lorenzo 
 He smashed him in the head with his own son's Nintendo 
 About a week later the boys came and rushed him 
 Kicked down his door while he was sleep they cuffed him"

 Promise you got something, Lord, that I honor you 
 Blow your lil' head off while you're tying your shoe 
 But back in the kitchen Pyrex's

 Hard vests, 86 got guards on, Benetton rugbies 
 And frames that fake guns when they rob [Incomprehensible] 
 To them that's natural action play the [Incomprehensible]

 Trying my best not to pop yet but the trop is major 
 Shot my lil' 'cause I do my aunt the favor watch this 
 I never been this itchy hope the cops just 
 Get a doughnut urge and just splurge you bot he nerve to play third 
 In a softball tournament round my way say that's your word you bird 
 I'll put your beak on a curb but anyway 
 Looks like a good game the pigs ain't leaving so I'm a lay 
 Nice play, just too bad it's your last 
 Couple bundles of D and 200 cash to sack you in the grass 
 So watch the teams line up, shake hands, guess the games over 
 Faggot nigga, hopped in a Liberty, fake Range Rover 
 I'm on his tail like Sonic little shorty palming on a 40 
 Broad day, I'm trying to dodge a cover story 
 Look like he stopping for gas I'm a pluck him, yay 
 This had to be his most unlucky, lucky day 
 2 brothers come out of 7 Eleven in army wear and stand there 
 Acting like my tires need air 
 He closed the gas cap, too many things going his way 
 So I just stashed that you probably think I'm bugging but, hey 
 I know them games in Lindsay Park is every Sunday 
 He ain't going nowhere 
 I went home switched gear went out and grabbed me a beer 
 10 drinks later I'm at Burger King window for a Whopper 
 Look left and see partner, I hit the stash bloka 
 Who the fuck you think you is Ron O'Neil 
 Tat tat what the fuck when that 9 milli peel 
 Is it real realer than Pittsburgh steel 
 Yo Ghost pass the toast these niggas is daffodils 
 Got buck naked bitches counting half a mil gloves on 
 Fully dressed bitches watching them with they snubs on 
 While I'm in the kitchen pretending to be Raekwon 
 Watching Rachel Ray all day, I get my cake on 
 Fiends love me like a Drake song 
 Rep that Louboutin bottom in my back pocket all day long 
 Black Wall Mafias, Wu-Tang Sopranos

 Niggas steady pushing Phantoms, we don't see the opera 
 Niggas steady rocking dreads, you ain't even Rasta 
 Take your New Era off and reveal 
 The fact the nigga you are or your cap getting peeled 
 Then we out to Brazil I know niggas in Negril 
 That'd chop your fucking head off and throw it on a grill 
 Take the gold out your mouth and throw it in they grill 
 Send a finger to your moms and let her know that this real 
 Nigga, we in the field like Chris Johnson 
 It's 2010 how the fuck we get 6 Thompsons 
 Top 10, how the fuck you gonna forget Compton 
 Every rapper on your list'll get their shit stomped in 
 I started soowoo, I'm the reason for that 5 shit 
 Came in the game on that fucking ready to die shit 
 Sold 9 mil ended up with some fly shit 
 Naked pictures, R&B bitches, all in my sidekick 
 How I be killin' the pussy should be a hate crime 
 Got a Blackberry was getting to much face time 
 Back to fucking project bitches now I hate dimes 
 All they want is money, my nigga, I can't waste mine 
 I sun niggas like it's day time

 Yo, yo 
 Aiyyo it's Tone, crispy like a pair of headphones 
 Used to play the 280 party rec rooms 
 Now I play the big spots all in the city 
 Spread champagne, scopin out bitties 
 Pick one, thick one son with small titties 
 It really doesn't matter as long as she's pretty 
 Come here mami, dancin right beside me 
 Tommy Hilfiger cut, skin like Halle 
 She looked like she get it from her momma (momma) 
 That's right Michelle, I'm Obama (bama) 
 Or maybe she get it from Madonna (donna) 
 (Material Girl) I still don ya (don ya) 
 Je-wels is for the girl if she do well 
 Knew she was dangerous, she rode me up too well 
 Her jelly roll shakin like she into the well 
 She wanna put my name on her new nails 
 (Chorus - repeat 2X) 
 Yo, yo 
 Aiyyo I roll on bitches, like a skateboard 
 Got a few friends that give they cake to whores 
 Me that's a no-no, Starks take control of a chick 
 Then I go deep like Tony Romo 
 Kick 'em right out and the day starts over 
 Where I don't stop drinkin' and I can't stand sober 
 In the morning when I wake up I get up just to ill 
 TD Bank is what I do with the mills 
 Bracelets, Cuban neck is on chill 
 Polar bear ice, I stay dressed to kill 
 I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill 
 Hittin the haze, now I'm on stilts 
 I'm too high, stuggle like Precious (Precious) 
 Love doctor niggaz get the message 
 When it comes to baggin a chick, don't be impressive 
 I get girls, y'all fellas is desperate 
 (Chorus - repeat 2X) 
 Yeah 
 Yeah, yo 
 Yo son tap that girl, excuse me miss 
 You gangster~! Far from a bougie chick 
 Love the way you talk, your jeans fit nice 
 Still a lil' hood in you, you just my type 
 Go 'head swallow that new roll, no disrespect 
 You front on me tonight I'ma bag me a new hoe 
 Spank that ass like a real papichulo 
 Picture me Neutron I sit you right on your culo 
 (Chorus - repeat 2X) 
 (Ghostface over Chorus) 
 That's right sexy lady 
 Come and have a seat baby 
 Come get a taste of this Patron and Nuvo 
 This that Jimmy Neutron baby 
 Your lipstick lookin' all good put your lips on this baby 
 Come sip on this, aight? 
 Check it out, let's go"
166,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,Starkology,"O... yo 
 Y'all respect my tour bus 
 We got whores with no drawers ready to do all four of us! 
 Wildin, bustin' big bags of Ruffles 
 Show money, rubber band'd up in the duffle 
 With dirtball niggaz that steal cake from stores 
 Boostin niggaz that pop tags in the mall 
 True spot hoggers, used a few stockings 
 Niggaz hand over the cash when heat's to they noggin 
 I sing a lil' lullaby, who gon' testify 
 The way a gruesome murder been televised? 
 Stupid! My name still ring in the streets though 
 Eighty-six, used to slip crack through the peephole 
 Biscuit like vaseline if I was a crook 
 In rap I'm past the cream, brand more lean 
 If you niggaz complain of sore throats 
 Shove the gun in they mouth, throat got scratched 
 They suckin on Halls yo 
 Yeah, yo 
 Yo this verse is like leavin' the gas on 
 Hog-tie a nigga for his bread, have the Hefty bag on 
 By any means, a cheddar king 
 Got a '98 kid's voice on smooth like Lenny Green 
 Word to my mother I air y'all niggaz out 
 Bigger chromers for the one who got the bigger mouth 
 (""Shout, shout, I'm talking to you, c'mon!"") 
 Go 'head and try me, you know you a bird 
 You could be on (Gangland) wit'cha face all blurred 
 Skull deaded up slumped over the curb 
 Just watch next time how you write your words 
 Leave you hangin' like your last name 
 Or a old man's nuts that sag with no shame 
 Payback's a bitch; yeah I smash y'all berries 
 'Fore they find you dead in your (Little House on the Prairie) 
 Yo, I can do this on crutches black with no legs 
 Both arms in a sling, push me on stage 
 Style still linger in the air like Glade 
 Girls my early 20's I used to run trains 
 Chill I got next, go behind Dirt 
 Sometimes I had to chill instead get neck 
 Rich chandelier gown all over my flesh 
 'Bout to throw ladies to Haiti, peace to Wyclef 
 Blowed y'all cream never throw dollar bills up 
 You know we window baggin that krillz up 
 Fingertips hurt puttin' that work in 
 Move that white in bulk nigga like Jergens 
 New rappers need to skip town 
 This the East coast music, Grandpa Ghost is around 
 Icon tellin' y'all now 
 Be out before dawn 'fore shit get wild!"
167,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,In Tha Park,"(Intro: Ghostface) 
 Yeah, niggas don't know about Fatback 
 With the different color records they had back in the days 
 You know what I mean, the belt-driven turntables 
 With Technics joints (with the slipmats!) 
 Put nickels on the needles so the motherfucking record won't jump 
 The needle won't skip and shit 
 Getting juice from the fucking light poles 
 Shout out to the Bronx, nigga! 
 (Verse 1: Ghostface) 
 Ay yo, this shit go way back like a Uni marker, kid 
 Bombing the D train and hit the Bronx up 
 Krylon bandits attack; Planet Rock, Bambaataa 
 Peace to Pylon discovering rap 
 And the DJ that made the first scratch 
 Paved the way for Flex, Mister Cee, 'nuff of them cats 
 See, this rap shit came at a time that was accurate 
 Twenty-something years later, I mastered it 
 Seen light poles get used for power 
 I was a little nigga 
 Couldn't stay out late - I was sour 
 So I sat by the window, heard the DJ cut 
 Impeach the Pres, Apache, and just begun 
 Otis Redding - slam! The music stopped 
 Guess the system blew out one of his amps 
 It'd take a little while, then it come back on 
 Somebody stepped on the wire and shit, that's all 
 Now everybody's back in the groove, echo chamber 
 ""Check one two, one two"" - that's my favorite 
 Strobe lights is live, Pink Champale 
 Little pink joints being lit up on the side 
 Couple niggas had two fives 
 Other than that, cleared a circle in the park and shoot 5 
 Girls wore they Lees and jellies 
 Jordache and Lees, TF Lords fit the fellys 
 Sams and Kangol buckets, BVD's 
 Go to Sergio's like, fuck it 
 Seen the stamp on that Crazy Eddie 
 Niggas coming back from the Funhouse dusted 
 Throwing bubbles on the wall 
 (Hook: Ghostface) 
 We must remind you 
 Where this rap come from 
 Yes my brother, my sister 
 It's our duty, we must remind you 
 Hip hop was set out in the park 
 We used to do it out in the dark 
 (Verse 2: Black Thought) 
 Yo, it all started at the After Midnight Philly, but walk with me 
 Mad niggas coming down from New York City 
 Prolly hit the skating rink USA 
 Banging Schoolly, ""Gangster Boogie"" and ""PSK"" 
 I remember shells, Gazelles, top tens, and lottos 
 Mega design, reefer smoke, Coqui nine bottles 
 Entire wore velours, call the boys with the Lucci wore 
 84's from Atlantic City Coogi store 
 Linoleum break dancing, Rust-Oleum cans 
 I put the writing on the wall signed, ""Truly yours"" 
 Philly smashed '87 Music Seminar 
 Out on the battlefield like Pat Benatar 
 Hit the borough with Krown Rulers out of Camden 
 People Patty Duke-ing in the party, all cramped in 
 Around the time Flav started cold lamping 
 ""Rebel Without a Pause"" was the street anthem 
 Old Memorex cassette, tape collections 
 Bright spotlights on all the fights at the Spectrum 
 When the Fresh Fest come, leather bombers and sheepskins 
 Brothers would bust they guns to get one 
 MC Breeze, Disco C, Jazzy Jeff 
 Cash Money and Miz and Lady B 
 Everybody banging ""Sucker MC's"" in '83 
 I was South Philly like St. Charles and Crazy D 
 Them wild North Side Puerto Ricans would snuff you 
 Twenty deep in a Ford Escort, pumping the Tuff Crew 
 I used to follow my cousin, he was a buck too 
 ""Y'all don't like how I'm living, well, fuck you!"" 
 I been a G since a little kid 
 Sticking my head up into somebody's dollar party, getting into shit 
 And late nights, shoulda been in bed 
 Instead, I was running 'round with them downtown lemonheads 
 A little man, hanging where them grown women is 
 Under thirteen, seeing real strong images 
 And that's the reason for my real rap penmanship 
 That's where I started it, and that's where I'm a finish it"
168,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,How You Like Me Baby,"Hey miss whattup? Tone got luck 
 I wore a lot of jewelry and I never got stuck! 
 Cats like the way I write, dressed like a superstar 
 Take care of family so I don't have stupid cars 
 Peace to all the single ladies, struggle with a rough life 
 Baby daddy threaten that's aight, check out my man Trife 
 Represent Stapleton, raised in the West 
 780 Anderson, now I'm the best 
 Stoppin' all bets, slammin' niggaz like Barkley 
 Back in my reefer days, sellin you parsley 
 Always kept aluminum, bags in the car seat 
 Them not show doin' them, that's where the NARCs be 
 Came to play no games and stay in your lane 
 And the ratchet's on your brain and fuck entertainment y'all 
 The big spender rock a robe in November 
 I never broke but I throw my trees up in the blender

 C'mon, how you like me baby? 
 You have a good time tonight? 
 Yo! Better shoe spots, red and blue drops 
 I used to serve those, those my rooftops 
 Dane cracked the window when the fuckin' room's hot 
 If my CD was skippin get a different boombox 
 New socks full of Polo, champ rugged low Mocc's 
 So hot, right before I popped the fuckin' show stopped 
 You can't box, I seen better hands on an old clock 
 The old ox never marked you, I'ma blow pop 
 Prophesized Don it's me, aqua blue mink 
 And my bitch arms'll be, 20 G's scrill 
 Niggaz like ""Pardon me,"" I'ma be honesty 
 Your man with the Dom P more like Sean Connery 
 Heard he fight crime like the old man Barnaby 
 Givin' you the business, crackheads and the wannabeez 
 And I keep drugs in the Tony Starks pharmacy 
 Desperate Housewives slobbin me 'cause they honor me 
 (Singing) 
 Hey, Mister! Please let my niggaz in 
 Thugs and my women in, you don't want no problem with meeeeee 
 We got them burners on the dancefloor

 We street bullies for cheddar, and that's our word 
 Pop bottles and spend money on chicks with curves 
 We the youth poetic justice, the kings and the Yankees 
 Our flows is vicious, check check, check out my melodies 
 (Shawn Wigs) 
 We gifted with vocab to make the streets spaz 
 And I'm infatuated with money like {?} grabs 
 Blow bags of that purple till I'm purple like Grimace 
 Burn spinach cause it keep up flows, Shawn's a menace 
 Even Barack watch ""The Wire,"" the streets is political 
 Watch how the '89 analog switched to digital 
 It's a miracle, we gettin' rich, offa visuals 
 Millionaires open doors, split them residuals 
 And still don't know how to act, spend 5 beams on jeans 
 Steady blowin' cream by the stack 
 I get my change, now go cop, get'cha a drink 
 And have a hoe butt-naked washed up by the sink 
 Blowin' stink, and I don't see grass on the field 
 So I'ma tear ass on that field 
 The Doe Wilson walk around with a bottle of Spades 
 Diamonds lookin' like I flossed in a cascade

 Dee dee dee da dee, dee dee dee dee da dee day 
 You asked for Donnie G oh won't you please come out and play 
 They know I keep that black girl, the black guns and the AK's

 Motherfucker what'chu lookin' at? The crook's back 
 Staten Island got my back, Brooklyn niggaz let it clap 
 Half these niggaz ride out, Harlem niggaz keep it real 
 Bronx got a shorty there, that's my little hideout

 Rubber grip, stainless steel, the night look gray

 Street bullies blastin, you ain't gotta ask it

 Can I, kick it? Yes you can 
 Can I, kick it? Yes you can 
 Can I, kick it? Yes you can 
 Well I'm gone - are you gonna miss me when I leave? 
 Besides this 8 times 5, got tricks up in my sleeve 
 Guaranteed, ain't nobody around these beez 
 See the team, we don't sleep, cause niggaz need green 
 We bleed different, we chase money, y'all can chase dreams 
 Came a long way, don't fuck that bread up in between 
 Tell 'em God sent you, load up that wop and let it ring ock 
 It's more than raindrops, when your nigga name get scratched off 
 Like his name dropped, that's when that thang pop 
 Y'all niggaz thought once too much, that's why your brain stopped 
 Lock and load both of them 40's I make the place hot 
 You can't wipe that up with no shirt, that take mops 
 Out the window here's another bomb let that bass drop"

 Niggers make pride by busting the gang 
 Might stick a nigger up making a gap 
 So dirty bag game but we give them the stacks 
 Pride game better add to fame 
 Some sell to weed ain't no joke 
 Might sell anything as long as we got 
 So if we are getting that bread will you come for your dope 
 Raising with a brother might too for the pride 
 Violate the rolls until your family is 
 Get bread in the ghetto while we're ?â??æ the feds

 Revenge is sweeter that sorbet 
 You all become believers when this heaters in your face 
 Just a part of my function 
 Y'all don't want no part of the gun spray 
 I would hate to pull it in one stray 
 That's where the innocence bystand 
 We're trapped inside these tenements like damn 
 Why mama try'na feed us this spiced ham 
 Connects try'na cheat us with light grams 
 Co-defendants try to lighten they sentence snitching to white man

 Beware, son, I got the stare of Medusa 
 With the rope tied around your neck, it won't get looser 
 I might shoot ya, make your ass an example 
 You can't fuck with Tony Starks, get knocked, get trampled 
 Get hunted like a rat in a field, I hate that 
 Hate fake ass niggas that love to set traps 
 Murder the don, I'm back with a bird on my arm 
 Back to pillage, I rock a live grenade as a charm 
 I want bodies, [?], spread into the waters 
 I want mothers and sons, I wanna murder their daughters 
 Revenge, all I see is blood in my eyes 
 Like the rise of your worst nightmare come alive 
 Ghostface Killah, let's see who's gonna survive 
 He spares no one, he's not forgotten 
 'Cause he was somewhere 
 Yo, look away, don't stare into the eyes of a killer 
 Metal lungies, junkies, nigga, I pack the nine millers and thrillers 
 Bulletproof robes and [?] caps 
 Revenge more, nigga, you know Ghost gone stay strapped 
 Hunt them down in alphabetical order 
 Each person that crossed me, watch the man slaughter 
 The butcher, the baker, the torturer, the taker 
 I'mma send you right back to your maker 
 A few extra holes, miss your soul sold to the devil 
 It's the rebirth of a slave brought back as a rebel 
 I'm immortal, gonna kill generations of your fam 
 You tried to loathe my legacy away, but I stand stronger

174,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,Rise Of The Black Suits,"Young aggressor, born into the life of crime 
 I would walk down the streets strapped with two nines 
 Bitch smacking, jacking niggas, G dub stacking figures 
 Police drive by, I was click clacking triggers 
 Jay De Lucas put me with the fam to grow 
 I was a boss amongst white boys rocking the 'fro 
 I had hoes, bankrolls and minks by the dozen 
 My rise to power was quick, they just wasn't 
 Tryna make me a made man, they fucked up the game plan 
 I blacked out on them and started my own clan 
 Black Gambino, black suits, black Syndicate 
 My crime fam was tight, every move was intricate 
 The coke was brought in from bad Colombian mules 
 Gorgeous women that I draped down in jewels 
 Streets fight started, mafia wars in Italy 
 Crime fam against fam and no one could do diddly 
 Do the dirty work, bring in the coke by the boatloads 
 Go against the grain, nigga, I feed nose holes 
 Follow no family rules, rules are for fools 
 Chase the paper 'cause it's the cash that rules 
 Fuck the law of fam, it's the law of land 
 You don't like how I move then try to force my hand 
 I'm moving keys, them DeLucas couldn't touch my pianos 
 Putting pressure on them Gambinis and Verrazanos 
 They love my money, they hate to see a nigga getting it 
 Selling drugs is taboo, but I ain't fucking sweating it 
 The dirt gotta get done so I took my position 
 One day I'm just Black Tone with a lot of ambition 
 Next I got status, dinners with all courses 
 Flights in and out of the country, they getting nauseous 
 Money, power, respect; rise of the black suits 
 Talk shit behind my back, but to my face salute 
 Hugs and handshakes, they can't stop my reign 
 Got the coconut, pilots bringing shit on their plane 
 It's a shame, they ain't have the balls to make moves 
 They pussies, couldn't walk a mile in my shoes"
175,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,I Declare War,"Yo, it's Tone Starks the don, the face of a killer 
 The voice of the past and presence, I speak thrillers 
 Rock the purple robe, crush them with 24 karat gold 
 The chain is chunky like the neck of a monkey 
 Glass slipper, my wallows is made from lion skin 
 King of the jungle, ain't shit about me humble 
 Rock a black panther hoodie, nigga, made from panther skin 
 I'm black on the outside and black within 
 The hood superhero, the motherfucking Don Dada 
 The Don Wilson, nigga, I do what I gotta 
 I'm a boss, them DeLucas trying to front on my skin tone 
 I left the fam to start a fam of my own 
 A black Italiano, big pinky rings from Sicily 
 I move like the don of the fam, it's officially 
 War time Starky, on some black avengers 
 Shadowboxing with killers that move like ninjas 
 I declare war, war on the De Lucas 
 Bulletproof jet planes, nigga, you can't shoot us 
 Can't stop my reign or terrorize the power 
 Tony Starks, new king of this crown, y'all better cower 
 (Verse 2: Masta Killa) 
 I'm prepared to go to war for the battle of supremacy 
 There's nothing now to remedy this decision 
 The only thing left is the loyalty of the family 
 Cause once we establish the power they gone turn sour 
 And use everything in their power to shut us down 
 We've come to far to turn around Tone 
 Got a new connect, Don Stone 
 Flew his private jet from Rome to talk business 
 He heard about your crime saga poems looking to invest millions 
 It's up to you Tone, this move can make us both rich 
 The crew is armed, cocked, and ready to rock steady 
 It's non-stop hustling, flow of their own casino, RZA Tarantino 
 It's Wu Gambino for life, you know how we go 
 And to the last breath blow, mi amigo 
 (Outro: RZA) 
 Born into a world with violence, death and destruction surrounding him at every turn. Tony Starks took control of his own destiny and aspired to become one of the foremost leaders of the criminal underworld. Regardless of his will, and the ability to run the streets with invincibility, there were still those who chose to stand in his way"

 Mafia ties, drugs and extortion 
 DeLucas vs. Stark-iano, headline the news 
 Police pull war on crime, they're gonna lose 
 Judges get kidnapped, casualties get decapitated 
 Starks rise above all to be emancipated 
 Black Godfather, families at war 
 Drive bys and Molotovs settle the score 
 Butcher shops are filled with chopped up casualties 
 I made sure to keep guns, you know my faculties 
 The streets run red when the bosses disrespect us 
 Neglected, I guarantee no man's protected 
 To each is own, grab a gun off the shelf 
 Cause in a warzone, the call is every man for self 
 Cause in a warzone, the call is every man for self 
 Cause in a warzone, the call is every man for self 
 How you prepare for war? Grab your guns and your hardware 
 Never close your eyes in the barber chair 
 The heart of a lion, that's what got him here 
 Bulletproof the car, yo we outta here 
 Fuck the DeLucas, we've got shooters with submachines 
 Bone-crushing niggas like a football team 
 Under a new regime, The old we throw it out 
 Spin back the hammer, let the lord sort 'em out 
 Keep your gun cocked, at the whorehouse 
 Sip the brown liquor, while we move a quarter ounce 
 Pick the territories, move north or south 
 The high power shine, Yours is watered down 
 I'm underground, with the vest is on 
 Open up your head, now your flesh is torn 
 Never turn my back up at restaurants 
 Put holes in your chest, come test the don 
 45 in my holster, let me stretch my arms 
 Cause in a warzone, the call is every man for self 
 Cause in a warzone, the call is every man for self 
 So the DeLucas want Tone? Nah, not today 
 Cock and spray, side with 'em and you've got to pay 
 Don't even kill 'em, just make 'em feel a lot of pain 
 Stake out his wife and his seed at the soccer game 
 Greet 'em with open arms, beat 'em with no regard 
 Feed 'em two two-threes, freeze 'em, leave 'em with no resolve 
 Make a lead on me, repping for the territory 
 No stepping on me, brethren that's a negatory 
 You want a war? These men pop dangerous 
 Taking all in a 10 block radius 
 Murder rate double, triple, cripple the strip 
 Like it got hit with a couple of missiles 
 8 will fly through your door, I'll get in your crib 
 In a wig, in a cable guy uniform 
 My shooters maneuver, we've got DeLuca in the scope 
 Moving close, say the word, Tone, do this Ghost"

 Did you see the moonlight shine?

 But the light shines nowhere 
 She was amazing Carmela, caramel complexion 
 Think God brought 'em into my life as a suggestion 
 We click, I like mink, she like iced out rings 
 The finer things in life, together we share drinks 
 Vodka and cranberry, my little cherry 
 If I got luck she will fill up my commissary 
 It was matching, I felt the bomb between us 
 She was the jelly to my peanuts, Mars to Venus 
 The earth to my sun, moon and stars we added up 
 Mathematically, it's like I had a bad habit 
 Bitch you knew my lifestyle, check of a crime boss 
 She would hide my guns in the house then lie to the task force 
 Finish my sentence, do my exact frame of mind 
 Knew everything I had was hers and she was mine 
 We were crazy in love, couldn't get enough of each other 
 The center of attraction, we were made for one another 
 Nah, don't even fall for that corkazoid 
 She got the drink blazed, try and turn into a android 
 She not yo peanut butter, more like a fuckin' nut case 
 You're a grouper, that De Lucas mob brought you to place 
 They blowing trains on a beating rate, come in her face 
 They got the drop on you sun, you a fuckin' disgrace 
 You think God sent her? I'd ask the devil instead 
 They got plans for you Ton, they want you dead dead dead 
 So get rid of that cherry popper, she mad poison through pa, carajo 
 They bout to bring the poison 
 Yeah Thunder, De Lucas mob want yo head on the platter 
 It don't matter, some of yo dreams is gonna shatter 
 They tryin' to get at you, she got you caught in the rapture 
 Nigga wake up, darling you done made for one another 
 She a snake, mogy gone, get yo sprayed rubber 
 It's a set-up, seen it before, Doofy got wet up 
 Nah you paranoid, letting yo mind get the best of you 
 She would never set me up or lace my drink 
 Watch how you talkin', you know what? You heatin' the mink 
 You dead wrong, confusion help with one of yo hoes 
 She's erratic, that chick, believe me 
 A nigga knows I'm the el capitan, put this whole squad together 
 Keep talkin' bro, I put one in yo leather 
 Ball cap, Logan to do the hit, now that's better 
 Ah man 
 Come on Ton 
 You sleepy eyes man 
 I told you before, son, yo 
 You gotta stay focused out here, look 
 Look out the window man 
 Lucas mobs, son you know who they are 
 Them same motherfuckers, yo I seen her with the niggas before 
 She's a set-up chick"
178,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,Enemies All Around Me,"I formed a crew, niggas straight tell me I'm slippin' 
 I'm the boss of the fam, I need to watch my position 
 Bitches are sneaky, triflin', and not to be trusted 
 A weak link in the team, in the chain of combustion 
 Don't trust her, love is for suckas 
 Too many enemies is out there son, tryin' to bring the ruckus 
 Keep a tight circle, don't let her rain on your parade 
 Keep doin' what we're doin', gettin' money and gettin' paid 
 Enemies all around me 
 One mistake and they'll down me 
 They just wanna rain on my parade 
 I said the enemies all around you 
 One mistake and they'll down you 
 They just wanna rain on your parade 
 It's mind-boggling the heart wants it, the mind rejects it 
 Fuck the past, let's put the present in perspective 
 That's my lady, she would never back-stab or cross me 
 Stand butt-naked in the storm, sippin' the frosty 
 Force me to choose, I'mma follow my heart 
 She was there from the beginning, but I tore 'em apart 
 No more Delucas, straight Killa Bee on the swarm 
 And when it's time to get big, she put her game face on 
 Enemies all around me 
 One mistake and they'll down me 
 They just wanna rain on my parade 
 I said the enemies all around you 
 One mistake and they'll down you 
 They just wanna rain on your parade"
179,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,An Unexpected Call (The Set Up),"It was an evil day the sun glistened over the city 
 Shined bright though the window and the eyes of my kitty 
 I was reluctant, a ball in the pit of my gut 
 Like the phone call I got was to just set me up 
 She wouldn't do that (nah) my love had love for the kid 
 So I slid on my wallows and bounced out the crib 
 Hit the block about 6 somth, shit got switched up 
 She pulled long inside and said ""jump in the truck"" 
 So I did, we supposed to be gone for ziti 
 She made the wrong turn, I'm like ""where you goin' to sweetie?"" 
 Felt the heat on the back of my neck 
 Did a mirror check, I didn't know what to expect 
 I got knocked out and woke up in the melting pot 
 I heard the delucas laughin' and then shit got hot 
 They say ""die tony starks, you gonna melt like a record 
 Never to be remembered, never to be respected 
 Yo I got word that my man got all 
 Rolling with logan, I told them damn that broad 
 No surprise why a shooter do this 
 Word in the street, she had a side deal working for the delucas 
 Word is out, apb, this bird is fowl 
 Put a price on it, the hood searchin' the house 
 The delucas won't stop without murkin us out 
 We should catch 'em while they celebrate and burst in the crowd 
 Tony dap shit is working me vex 
 They sayin' think chill, 'cause we'll let you circle the next 
 Don't need to boil in vinyl, can't let it slide fool 
 I guess it's just my time to die too 
 First of all logan gotta make a talk 
 Who's yo boss? who's yo boss and who make the call? 
 Tell me or not, you're sleeping with the fishes 
 But first tell yo boss that he will get hit"
180,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,Rise Of The Ghostface Killah,"(Introduction: RZA) 
 The DeLucas pressed Tony's remains 
 Into 12 vinyl records 
 One for each member of the family 
 But little did they know 
 He would return... 
 (Verse 1: Ghostface Killah) 
 Medusa stare, my guns bust in silence 
 I'm a black vigilante killer, pro violence 
 It's the rebirth, born again, rise through the vinyl spin 
 They took out Starks but the light shines within 
 It's the almighty rise of the murderous Ghostface 
 Bodies dropped in Owls, left a cold case 
 Colombian neckties from a black Gambino 
 Bodies get dumped in the black El Camino 
 It's Reno, gangster wars, money, power, respect 
 Revenge is felt like the heat from a Tec 
 Tommy guns are irrelevant, I'm bulletproof now 
 I could fly through the air and duck your chick-a-pow 
 Black superhero, crime boss arch nemesis 
 Good vs. Evil since the first book of Genesis 
 Battle to the end that's the way of the thriller 
 And Starks is reborn as the Ghostface Killah... no one could get iller 
 Murders, bodies chopped into Ziplocs 
 Kill or be killed on these cobblestone street blocks 
 Crime boss, I call warn the DeLucas 
 Watch my eyes turn red, I got a squad full of shooters 
 Murder, murder, kill, kill, kill 
 When the gas start to hum I put the spark to your grill 
 (Verse 2: Ghostface Killah) 
 Late night, stuck in the limo 
 Hogtie the capo all up, beheaded the driver 
 Left the bitch in the back with no tongue as the survivor 
 Raw dog, spit in her mouth 
 Disappear in a swarm of killer bees 
 Cripple 'em from they knees, take they legs out (Nigga you know the steez!) 
 I'm a nighthawk, eagle eye, power of mind control 
 Faster than the speed of light, you catch a big hole 
 Ruthless, six bodies hung in the meat room 
 The butcher shop, I call it the body shop 
 Start from the bottom, killing all the way to the top 
 Carve my name in your skin, pull a stocking mask over your face 
 For recognition, no time for remission 
 Attack till there's no one left in the position 
 The return of the worst case scenario 
 Uh, Ghostface attacks on land and now aerial"
181,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,Revenge Is Sweet,"Roads of glory, praising me the same 
 Winds of fury, cycle in the rain 
 Cycle in the rain with the span of time

 Roads of glory, praising me the same 
 Winds of fury, cycle in the rain 
 Cycle in the rain with the span of time 
 Through the frame of mind the winds remind

 (Sit to) show me (in the) time would never start anew 
 (If any) body (knew that) time would 
 (Sit to) show me (in the) time would never start anew 
 (Verse 1: Ghost) 
 Ayo, revenge is sweet, that's why I take my time with it 
 Like good pussy I just stay when I'm up in it 
 Evil plan, my mind functions well off spite 
 I don't do that tit for tat, I blow your shit up like dynamite 
 Take my life, I'll take every one you love 
 Have your kids thrown out of a plane, 'look out 'cause 
 My plots are like movie scripts, they well planned 
 Snatch you off the land and drop you off in the sahara sand 
 So don't scam me, don't try to double cross me 
 My Tennessee goons'll nail that ass to the cross, B 
 Revenge mode, I live life by the sword 
 And if you live by it, die by it, I'll still kill your horse 
 Set me up, coming back, like a thief in the night 
 I'll have a suicide bomber pop up on your flight 
 You couldn't take my life, my mask done resurrected 
 And I'm Ghostface Killah, way more than you expected 
 Those who fear his return 
 Must face the catastrophe 
 (Verse 2: Masta Killa) 
 Yes, but what they didn't expect, a hundred ghouls 
 From the projects armed and masked with flamethrowers 
 And gas'll blast anything, hung him by his tongue ring 
 Till he gave the info on how we find his kinfolk 
 Made him sign the ransom, then gave the note to his grandson 
 Bust the shot and made him run fast 
 Back to his family, news of his discovery 
 Would set off a chain of events that would 
 Then lead to members of DeLucas to bleed with no exception 
 They sip the raw mussles so kill everything 
 No exception to the media 
 There would not be a retire or cease fire till every Luca has expired 
 In entirety, wishes of the god 
 Tone Starks to eternity, respectfully 
 (Interlude: RZA) 
 Cutthroats, murdersprees, and killings were synonymous with his gangsta life before his passing. So it'da only seem fitting that it would become the embodiment of his new life 
 (Killa Sin) 
 I keep having flashbacks of blasting at you bastards, cutting outside the benches 
 Got convicted of the gun charge and laughed at my sentence 
 Four years, five flat post-release supervision 
 For niggas spitting in the wind, but that's what I get for missing 
 So soon as I hit the bridge again, niggas is finished 
 Ninja mode on a mission out to end your existence 
 Think I'm sitting up in prison 
 With a tin of L, in a cell, sick ass hell, listen 
 Everyday is like christmas, I miss my seed and my missus 
 But I see 'em on visits, I ain't stressing over pussy 
 Beat my dick to her pictures 
 When they free me I'mma see you, leave you food for the fishes 
 Hope the Luca crew is in for the fixing 
 Now get the henchman, line 'em up 
 Tommy gun 'em down, the muzzle extension 
 Tear they flesh off if one of 'em flinching 
 Those who fear his return, must face the catastrophe 
 The Catastrophe 
 Those who fear his return, must face the catastrophe 
 The Catastrophe 
 The Catastrophe"
182,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,Murder Spree,"Yeah, yo, there's a dozen ways to die, six million ways to do it 
 Let's go through it, my mind flow like fluid 
 Torture, chop your legs up, thrown off the boat 
 Guillotine, nigga, one chop to the throat 
 Suffocation, saran wrapping your face 
 Buried alive, throw a few nails in the case 
 Manslaughter, eight degrees of separation 
 Leave your body chopped up in a piece, that's mutilation 
 Six million ways to die, cyanide in your drink 
 Catch a cuban necktie for your mink 
 Dahmer style, cut up and stuffed in the fridge 
 And maybe washed up and show around thunder the bridge 
 Hit him with the whip, drag him half a block 
 Machete or the sock full of padlocks 
 Chainsaw, switch your medication 
 Stomp a nigga out till he one with the pavement 
 Torture, he's gruely peaking at the meeting 
 Suspicions of him being a rat? even worse than cheating 
 I'm cold reaking of ice picks, scratch and sticks and closed fists 
 Brassknuckle steel toe kicks 
 Crack ribs, punch your lungs, hard weaving 
 He's gasping and wheezing for air, his breath he can't catch 
 He clinches the shirt on his chest 
 In a dying effort to reveal his last will before he was killed 
 First things first, I chop your head to your fingertips 
 Butcher knife your torso, chop up your ligaments 
 Make sure it's legitimate, conceal all my fingerprints 
 Chop, chop your body up quick then get rid of it 
 A hole in the desert, body bag, just polluted it 
 Your miss was a snitch too? shotgun killed the bitch 
 Leave her in the wilderness, suffocated and scarred up 
 Your brother want more too, blow his fucking car up 
 Another homocide city, murder mystery efficiently 
 Delete your fucking history broke bone, missing teeth 
 Throw bones, it's slippery, brings on the triple beam 
 All topped and chopped up, my luck is a mr. clean 
 Clorax and vicious steam sterilized the whole scene 
 Photograph your death so I can spread it to your whole team 
 Won't leave a trace of evidence for the case 
 It's sinister to finish it, hit with the man with no face 
 Red wine and pink pill 
 Unknowingly that this would be his last meal 
 Cut the voice, made the field, six inch stiletto heel 
 Kept his refills filled 
 Till he's like the gas, kept him still for the real deal 
 Hitman from brooklyn, tommy gun specialist 
 Sipped cavasier at the bar then waited till she lit a cigar 
 Then sprayed 
 Them shatter wine glass he laid, he never saw it coming 
 Yo, murder one, bullets went fast through the flesh 
 I cocked the sawed off shotty, put a hole in your chest 
 Blow your lungs out, I've seen you been smoking for years 
 You got no heart, I'll hunt you down like cape fear 
 Push your brains out the back of your head, blow off your hands 
 Leave your body in a dumpster, head in the trashcan 
 Cell catching scene look clean as a whistle 
 Ghost carved through your skin tissue till the bone grizzle"
183,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,"The Sure Shot, Pts. 1- 2","Record spins, I'm going in 
 I don't shoot to kill, I play to win 
 Stay catching up with the cutthroats 
 Some men shoot a nigga, throw 'em off the tugboat, no floats 
 The body sinks to the bottom 
 Or left off the side of the road to smell rotten 
 The murder sprees, random killings 
 Ghostface killah's back attacking villains, hanging from the ceilings 
 Godfather motives, gangsta mentality 
 Black superhero with the immortality 
 Forever, I be creeping in a black mist 
 Ill night vision with the militant tactics 
 I glide through the air like a swarm of bees 
 Shake niggas off quick like a dog with fleas 
 Raw meat, leave bodies slumped in the street 
 Revenge is the spice of life, it's so sweet 
 Ay yo, pipe bombs blowing they souls to Jesus 
 Don't need nothing but the puzzle glue for the pieces 
 Meat cleaver cut finger tips like rib tips 
 Home invasions, cars gonna flip, the mucous lose 
 Pair of cement shoes, tossed in the ocean 
 Popped until they brain ooze, I won't lose 
 Blood all on my apron, hog tie 'em up while they try escaping 
 Peeped the visual, tied 'em up individual, 
 Took their clothes off, season 'em like sausage 
 Let the pits out to eat 'em, that's the remedy 
 Attack, kill, bite off their extremities 
 Blood bath splash my name on my wall 
 Call it piece delivery, leave a tip on the stall 
 With an arm, leg, a head 
 I'm coming for you all 
 It's the sure shot 
 Heart of a lion 
 King of the jungle 
 I'm a humble killer bee 
 You as soft as a bumble 
 I don't crumble, I strike back hard with a vengeance 
 Attack through these killer words I spit in a sentence 
 I'm a menace, the black card cape, caped crusader 
 The face of a ghost, I disappear in the vapors 
 You could murder my flesh and bone, soul's invincible 
 Revenge my death, payback's the main principal 
 Protect ya neck when you move, I be lurking in the shadows 
 Starks, the gangsta nigga, I never lose battles 
 Pimp bitches, with a superhero logo on my chest 
 Big gucci link, GFK on the crest 
 Icy arm for the eagle with the eight carat ruby eyes 
 Piss on your motherfucking lawn while I'm stupid high 
 All black down, royalty purple and some ice chips 
 Two glock 9s pointed at you in a hype flick 
 Now I'm alone in the room, and I just stare at the wall 
 Revenge my death but I'm going through with yours 
 My lost niggas, I miss them 
 This new power and wisdom 
 Got me thinking I've made a whole lot of bad decisions 
 Got locals still to deal with 
 Should I kill her? 
 Throw her fuckin' ass in a cage with a gorilla 
 Or let her live and treat her like scum of the earth 
 I've got goons to feed and babies to birth 
 I'm the god now, plus I'm a super rich nigga 
 Do more help than harm, either way you figure 
 Should I protect and serve 
 Or cock and aim destruction? 
 Let the enterprise take over the force of production 
 Corruption, my mind state is unpredictable 
 I'm bulletproof now, back from the dead, I'm invincible"

 Ayo, I'm back after nine years, that's 36 seasons 
 Shit is changed up for all types of reasons 
 Staten Island ain't the same, shit is lame 
 No familiar faces son, I'm dodging the game 
 I want a clean slate, but these cops stay screwin' 
 Snatching me up off the block, what am I doin'? 
 Oh, it's officer Dingle and his sidekick Berry 
 Driving me around the hood so I could worry 
 See how fucked up it is there's crackheads on every corner 
 Kids in the schoolyard smoking marijuana 
 I ain't feeling it, this ain't the way I left these blocks 
 And my name's faded out like some old damn socks 
 I want respect, these streets was my playground once 
 I was the Mack across 110th on these stunts 
 Not once would a nigga test me or gets zesty 
 I would walk down the street and sneeze, they all blessed me 
 (Hook: Tre Williams) 
 Been on the battlefield for a long, long time 
 I can see life closing in on this old body of mine 
 (Verse 2: Kool G Rap) 
 Yeah, homie, I'm the kingpin called Future 
 Make a killin' in these buildings in the millions 
 Got 'em feeling like Brewster 
 Shit hot as Fallujah 
 Kids grown now, they cock rugers 
 Welcome back to the sewers 
 Where new whips maneuver 
 No kids playing, no safe and sound havens 
 There's tre pound cases on the playground pavement 
 No more dudes with 22's in their sneaker soles 
 Kids tote shit that leave your body with a heap of holes 
 I'm that neighborhood blizzard flooding these streets with snow 
 Heavy iron on the ready, my shit'll crease your clothes 
 Keep a flock of sweetest hoes, yeah, I sleeps with those 
 Little slum young Keisha Coles with cheaper clothes 
 Undercovers all around the gutter, they creepin' low 
 I stays ahead, kid, I toss bread like pizza dough 
 I keep the tef around my torso with the piece below 
 That bulldog short nose, G be at peace with those, you know 
 (Verse 3: AZ) 
 Mama Bear was a church woman, pop's skated off 
 I was impaired, an introverted youngin', a lot changed my course 
 From nowhere to my first onion then them cops came across Flashed the badge, took my stash, told my little ass get lost 
 Threw me off when my grind was prime time then 
 You could step on and stretch mine's to a nine times ten 
 I was gone, remembering though that fine line's thin 
 So I studied that chessboard and we were all blind men 
 Dealers ran the streets, but the D's ran them 
 I was a killer underneath, but needed expansion 
 Something to constitute being high in a coupe 
 The cries from my youth so I applied for the suit 
 Salute to the enforcer, call me officer now 
 Supporter of paraphernalia, I toss it around 
 The link to the cartel, costs is down 
 It's that Denzel in training day shit, caution my grounds"

 Love is love, it'd been a long time comin' 
 9 long years, I know she missed my lovin' 
 Huggin', kissin' in the scent of the kid 
 She gonna fall out when she see me at the crib 
 Ding dong, can I speak to Bamboo? 
 It's me Penelope, stop actin' a fool 
 She said, ""damn, I thought you was dead 
 Not a phone call? Not a card in the mail?"" 
 For real a phone call? Stop 
 You know I had to up and leave 
 I told you I'll be back, girl, but you ain't believe 
 She told me 9 was too long, and she got a new man 
 One who gon' stay and hold it down for the fam 
 So scram, there's no more love for the kid 
 So I turned my head down and walked away from the crib 
 (Hook: Kandace Springs (Ghostface Killah)) 
 Loved so many times 
 I've been alone so long 
 Had to pull myself together 
 Find my heart a brand new home 
 Got a good thing goin' on 
 Can't let you mess with my flow 
 Too little, too late 
 Love don't live here no more 
 (Love is love, Tony's back up on the aisle)

 Cried so many times

 Love don't live here no more 
 Love don't live here no more

 It's like that? 
 Okay then where you put all my stuff at then? 
 You know, I thought, you know I swear he's, he been doin' this for too long 
 I done came home, you got another man, you know what 
 (Verse 2: Ghostface Killah) 
 Oh word, so you over it? That's absurd 
 I never did a damn thing to deserved it 
 This is a man's world, I go away come home lookin' for you 
 Now you fuckin' up the plans, girl 
 You another man's girl, that ain't kosher 
 Once you see the kid's face you're supposed to 
 Drop what you're doin', show your loyalty and love 
 Step out on the porch with a kiss and a hug 
 Yo you buggin' 
 (Outro: Ghostface Killah) 
 Just can't understand, you know. I treated you, I gave you everything you wanted. You know what I'm sayin'? And it's like you got another dude laying in the bed? 
 Wearin' my robes, wearin' you out 
 I know I was gone but damn, I just can't get it, baby 
 But I loved you though man, and I still do though"

 Yo, I've seen Raj 
 He been a friend for years 
 Now your boy in blue, how he switched up gears 
 He said how I been? 
 I got a ear full of bad news 
 Your block is corrupt and it's time to choose 
 We got some niggas running drugs that can't be touched 
 Unless you wanna' handle the dirt, it'll mean so much 
 I said I got this, message received 
 I'mma clean up the block like you wouldn't believe 
 Call me Mr. Clean, aka Starkiano 
 Nine years later slid across the Verrazano 
 Clean sweep, apply pressure to the scum 
 This is my town, Stapleton is where I'm from 
 Third shot slapped in the head with a juice box 
 Grenade with no pin in his mouth, this is my block 
 And Bamboo fucking with this is absurd 
 I'mma handle my bee's wax, that's my word 
 (Hook: Rell) 
 Came up out the darkness, searching for light 
 I know home is where my heart is 
 And now nothing seems right 
 I tried to make peace and cut my losses 
 And carry on somehow 
 But I've come much too far, man 
 Too late to turn back now, here I go again 
 Here I go again 
 Here I go again 
 Here I go again

 Now I'm exposed, my nigga, you haulin' 
 Streets is different

 Yeah, yeah, welcome home Starks' 
 Remember us? At the jams in the parks 
 All gold guzzlers, Wallabee Clarks 
 Young cold hustlers, obviously sharp 
 Voom with the purpose to bloom, so in tuned 
 Dialogue like the Disciples in the circle of goons 
 My ace boon, then you got sent to the tombs 
 And shit went left, had to pinch my flesh 
 And figure some other scheme to get cream, reign supreme 
 You know everything ain't what it seems 
 So I switched up size, had switch up lives 
 And now I can fuck life and rip her thighs 
 A badge and a gun that's legal, it's more lethal 
 Than any local dealer that's evil leave you peoples 
 The sequel 
 Me and you both could split a loaf 
 Just need you a little closer 
 You could squeeze that toast 
 And knock off targets, starting with the hardest 
 By next year my nigga, we be the largest 
 Felonies done with no charges"

 Yeah fam listen, I'm ambitious 
 I'll leave a man missing 
 Plain and simple, tickin' under his transmission 
 Did my first hit 12 years old, pants sliddin' 
 A little place in Coney Island called the clam kitchen 
 I walk right up on the table where I can't miss em 
 And his bodyguard coming out of the can pissin' 
 The two waiters serving plates stood in a trance, shivering 
 I carried out the damn mission, that's loyalty 
 No regrets anything less will destroy the peace 
 A boss is a boss learn to respect royalty 
 Run off with money get put down in the soil free 
 Now sit down and enjoy the feast, boys kapeesh 
 Been running here for 9 years 
 And believe me none of them kind years 
 I done lost about 9 peers 
 Crime career never find fear 
 Soulless eyes my guys got a blind stare 
 (Verse 2: Nems) 
 My intuition told me play my position and stay loyal 
 You ain't got to get your hands dirty, I'll do it for you 
 I grew up on the crime side, the New York time side 
 And gave up on everything when my moms died 
 Perfected my craft on rooftops and staircases 
 Pulled robberies with no mask showing my bare face 
 Keep it G, low key, and never ball out 
 Got with a sick ass clique and went all out 
 Gat for gat back to back we can brawl out 
 Hundred deep run up in Macy's and aired 'em all out 
 Just give the ordering my niggas will come 
 Give me your gun, point 'em out and consider it done 
 The streets fathered me, so I'm considered its son 
 Keep it real stay sucker free and the figures will come 
 Live by the gun and put my life on the line 
 Anybody can get left bullets right through your mind"

 It's a Thin Line Between Love and Hate 
 It's a Thin Line Between Love and Hate 
 It's five o'clock in the morning and I'm just getting in 
 I knock on the door and a voice sweet and low says 
 (Who is it) She opens up the door and lets me in (let me in) 
 Never once did she say where have you been? 
 She said, (are you hungry), are you hungry honey, (did you eat) 
 Yeah, let me hang up your coat 
 The woman says, pass me your hat 
 And all the while she's smiling 
 Never raises her voice 
 It's five o'clock in the morning and I don't give it a second thought 
 It's a Thin Line Between Love and Hate 
 Don't think you can keep breaking your woman's heart 
 It's a Thin Line Between Love and Hate 
 And you should sit back and enjoy it 
 (It's a Thin Line), Yes it is, yes it is, (Between Love and Hate) 
 She gonna fool you one day 
 The sweetest woman in the world, can be the meanest woman in the world 
 (If you like her that way) 
 You keep hurting her, she keep being quiet 
 She might be holding something inside, she gonna hurt you one day 
 Now I'm laying in the hospital, bandaged from feet to head 
 In a state of shock, just that much from being dead 
 I didn't think my woman can do something like this to me 
 I didn't think the girl had the nerve 
 Here I am, I guess actions speak louder than words 
 It's a Thin Line Between Love and Hate 
 Don't keep thinking you can keep treating your woman bad 
 It's a Thin Line Between Love and Hate 
 She won't ever get mad 
 (It's a Thin Line), Yes it is, yes it is, (Between Love and Hate) 
 She's gonna fool you one day 
 (It's a Thin), It's a line thin, (Line Between Love and Hate), between love and hate 
 It's a Thin Line Between Love and Hate 
 She's gonna fool you one day 
 (It's a Thin Line), Yes it is, (Between Love and Hate)

 The chemical burns on his face, I wanna throw up 
 I hugged him, felt his heart beatin', his chest breathin'

 Them niggas out of pocket with it (word) 
 Buck shots, left his big man chopped to a midget (blaow-blaow) 
 Rippin' crazy shit, poppin' from a Civic 
 Warm biscuit tryin' to put this nigga Starks in a barrel 
 Them slugs hit the wall, I assassinated his shadow (damn) 
 At the train yard, my tires rollin' over gravel (yeah) 
 I hope I hear him step on the third rail and crackle 
 Now I'm hoppin' out the whip, gotta finish this 
 My bigger (??) about to show him what the business is 
 Parked trains, darker rain, ain't no witnesses (where he at?) 
 I swore I heard his footsteps right behind me (word, yo) 
 So, I turned around quick to do this nigga slimy 
 Nothin' but a black stray cat ran over line three (what's that?) 
 A homeless man rollin' cans in a shoppin' cart (oh, shit) 
 And then, from top of the train, came a pop, a spark 
 Tried to pop back but I was locked in a arch 
 The nigga hit his mark right on top of my heart (aw, damn) 
 My whole chest went numb and the pain got sharp (down) 
 Fell face down on the ground, saw the Timberland mark 
 He bopped, swingin' the gun like a pendulum arm

 But couldn't extract the chemicals from my body 
 Poisonous lethal doses, comatosis 
 In and out of conscious, drugs is ferocious 
 The mass released the gas that simmer the soul 
 So my adrenaline stays level not out of control 
 I been contaminated, physically altered 
 Got wrong for doing right, my attitude salted 
 I'm bitter, I clean up the community 
 Fuck these New York City cops 
 I don't need the 'mmunity

 The leading expert on war, and weaponized diseases 
 The brilliant Doctor X, no scientist is colder

 Its destruction is impossible, totally irrelevant 
 The compounds are not found on a periodic table of elements 
 Adamantium plus Vibranium the fords fills your bill 
 Will shield your cranium 
 If anyone would try to place the mask upon their face 
 The mask corrupts yah 
 It's designed to match your molecular structure 
 Plus the goal was to give it a touch of luster 
 To match the eagle bracelet adjust to your repulsive thrusters 
 Busta psychology, the wallaby that adapts to the environment 
 That's the militant technology

 Beyond definition what this falls into 
 M's in my optic, no ends to the profits 
 Judges, prosecutors, politicians in my pocket 
 Hostage, high life, living on the edge 
 Toxic in hindsight, see me when I'm dead 
 Pledge, sworn in to serve and protect 
 What a web, catch a neck, then I'm onto to the next

A black crime family led by Lester Kane has made a violent push for supremacy against the surviving member of the Deluca clan, now residing in New York City. In attempt to thwart his adversary advances, Luther Luca, the head of the Deluca clan, guns down members of the Kane syndicate, as well as Lester's wife and son. The war escalates. In one fatal night, Lester and his men rob one of the Deluca clan social clubs, discovering 12 vinyl records hidden within a safe"

 When will they learn, loose lips will get your flesh burned 
 Puffing on a Cohiba Cuban

 Pimped out in the Coupe de ville '72 
 Lock and load on patrol, lotta hoes on the stroll 
 Give me street 411 like whoop-de-whoop 
 Where's the cane man? How many nights I live by this dupe? 
 Names change like slang, still be aiming to shoot 
 Call it pop-pop poacher and note the .45 will rise up 
 (Ghostface Killah:) 
 Message worth it's weight in gold, he a beast 
 When God made his son, he broke the mold 
 Crushing De Lucas, they tryna dismember cane, silly game 
 Watch his downfall, put an end to it 
 Street laws, gangsters pulling murders and drive-bys 
 New York city, flood the streets with cyanide, poison 
 The boys in blue don't want none of it 
 Watching cane ride the power, and I'm loving it"

 Crime fam against fam 
 Streets is a war zone, blood bath 
 Running for protection 
 Kane's against DeLucas, bullets in both directions 
 Duck at the safe house and re-up your ammo

 Snatch chains, wallets, bitches front row 
 Tear the clubs up, all social events 
 If a nigga act tense put a hole in his fence 
 This ain't for fun but it's fun though 
 I gotta run though, money ain't shit watch me burn a few hunndo 
 Tear the DeLucas down like the legend of Tone Starks 
 Tie bricks around his ankles, have him swimmin' with sharks 
 Dynamite they safe, lookin' for heirlooms 
 It's personal, I want the keys to the tombs

 Connects to the banks and the police station 
 I want those faces rolled, truth behind the legend

 Search till it hurt, records from the retched abyss 
 Murdered them, they scurred, reck him till he reckin' his shit 
 If he alludin' his life worth losin' 
 Kane said a record earned is a pot of gold 
 Prize a loan, put a marble floor in my momma home 
 Never need a loan, put the rest in the bank

 Crack the safe and peeled out twelve sealed discs 
 Lookin' Illmatic, wrapped up in a robe 
 They were records, each one marked with a code 
 It said ""Do Not Play"" in big bold letters 
 The DeLucas pressed, stamped, engraved Vendetta 
 I think we hit it, reservation of Ghostface 
 Shoulda known they had that shit hidden at Tone's place 
 Hit Logan sip chilled Don Maretta 
 Big glasses of wine bringin' sharp chedda 
 Get the vinyl to headquarters, asap codes 
 And tell Lester we hit the mother of all loads

 Breaking into the home of Luther Luca, Lester finds Logan hiding with her son 
 Logan is the ex-mistress of Tony Starks 
 Yeah, that's that bitch that set him up to be killed 
 He confronted Logan about the past 
 She confessed, but she had remorse for her betrayal 
 She also confessed the unknown truth about the young boy 
 He was Tony Starks' 
 Secret son..."
204,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,Death's Invitation,"(Ghostface Killah:) 
 Ayo Kane found Logan lamping at Deluca's 
 Sitting with a little black boy, she called him Lucas, he knew it 
 Found himself the daughter of a kingpin 
 The ex of Tony Starks, it's a win-win 
 His seed, the grief filled up in his eyes 
 He kidnapped them both, for a scheme of revenge 
 Pillow cases over their heads, tossed in the Benz 
 No friends, no foes, only evil to expose 
 Let's make a video 
 Tell Lu I got his grandson and daughter 
 And I ain't lookin' for no ransom 
 I want revenge, I want blood, I want his head on a rug! 
 I want him to watch me strangle his daughter 
 Butcher his babies, attack pits foamin out the mouth with rabies! 
 M-80s stuffed in his ass cause bodily harm 
 This is just the fuckin' tip of the storm! 
 Tell him to come! Tell him we need to speak man to mush! 
 As soon as he step in the building... 
 Ambush! 
 (Lyrics Born:) 
 At day break, the Delucas made their way through the main gate 
 Quietest cougars chasing wild gang prey 
 They cut through the chained fence up through the five escape steps 
 They raided the Kane gang [?] 
 The look on Kane's face when he realized what was taken place 
 He was anticipating a payday, but he was faced with a melee 
 He sprained to his feet but his legs wouldn't stay straight 
 Afraid, he reached for his piece, Bang Bang! Bang Bang! 
 But wait, as if on cue, the Deluca crew called out, ""Lucas!"" 
 And began shooting unison, maneuvering from each of the rooms in pursuit of Kane 
 Blew smoke and the cue dreamt irrefutable stench of mutilated flesh and the death of human beings! 
 Finally it was over 
 The Delucas lowered their revolvers and put them back in their shoulder holsters 
 They shifted through the dead remains 
 The bedrooms, and the entry way 
 Where the hell is lester kane?! 
 (Chino XL:) 
 Now what is this that stands before me? 
 Underneath this wack off coughing 
 It's Logan and her half beat offspring 
 I got the nod from Kane that I'll be enforcing [?] 
 (Lyrics Born:) 
 Kane's gang had no imply the Delucas had staked out the vacated building for eight days 
 They knew about his way in, the way out, the makeshift escape route 
 The hidden staircase, the way down to the basement in the safe house 
 Where to find Logan and her afraid child 
 In a dark corner where they were being held 
 They were blindfolded with taped mouths 
 No light or water, arms and legs bound 
 (Chino XL:) 
 But there's a double cross of course, I'm hearing guns letting off from somewhere else 
 I'm ready to get involved with the revolving [?] warehouse all by myself 
 I dive underground finding rounds

 The sacrifice 
 The glory of the Ghost controls the soul 
 (Ghostface Killah:) 
 Time to surrender your physical being 
 So I can hear, touch, and smell, and start seeing 
 Life as a precious gift given from God 
 So I can enjoy my siesta, healing these scars 
 Take this knife and push it through your windpipe slowly 
 Come on Lester Kane, you better show me 
 You're a man of your work, a criminal conduct 
 You gotta sacrifice your life or else your time's up 
 He took the knife, the look on his face got calmer 
 I watched him take his life like a suicide bomber 
 (Raekwon:) 
 It's time to go, I made a promise and I'm a man of my word 
 I'm a G and my bond will never swerve 
 I dreamed about this time and this place and I swear I've seen it 
 Now I'm face-to-face with a death angel 
 Thinking about the lies that I took with no strife 
 Standing here holding a knife, now I'm 'bout to take my own life 
 But it's for a good reason 
 My spirit needs to be replenished so I walk on my soul and be delinquent 
 (Ghostface:) 
 Lifeless, his body left slumped in a chair 
 It was time to become one, but my mind wasn't there 
 I wasn't sure if I wanted to walk this corrupt Earth 
 Smell sweat instead of fear, give up my powers 
 Be a simple man, but along a ruthless killer 
 Crime born syndicate, another sinner 
 Murderer, take lives like mine's was once taken 
 Or leave my seed in this cold world, my heart's aching 
 (Raekwon:) 
 Man up soldier, no need to back it up now 
 I'm in a large space, beauty queens feeding me grapes 
 Jewels all thick and clusty 
 Me and the father ain't rusty 
 What's the matter talking about you're not sure anymore 
 Did you lie to your brother Kane or died I die in vain? 
 You don't wanna be a sinner but sinning is in your veins 
 You a general, love the life you running in the city 
 Pretty women, lots of money, doing anything you want 
 Think about it, me and you as one force 
 There's no limit the way they can take it, time is ticking, jump up in my corpse 
 And be true living king that you are, you need to live again 
 So you can enjoy the fruits and shine like the stars 
 Drink the finest wines and dawn on exotic moods 
 Tell the people who never helped, dropping a little jewels 
 Son you hesitating - I didn't hesitate for you 
 When it was my time to go, I'm cocked it the showed proof

 With Lester Cane's revenge complete 
 There's only one thing left to do 
 Logan begs him to stop, but Lester does not listen 
 He puts the gun to his head, and pulls the trigger 
 Killing himself with honor 
 Seconds before Lester's final breath escapes his body 
 Ghostface becomes consumed by a diabolical revelation 
 Inhabit the flesh of his young son, and he could live as a reincarnated Tony Starks 
 (Ghostface Killah:) 
 Ayo fuck it, I'm taking the soul of my son 
 Live through the eyes of my young 
 We gon' rule, conquer, pillage and destroy 
 Bulletproof shit, blast through alloys 
 But first things first bitch you fuck with the worst 
 Logan, I'm about to quench ya thirst 
 Put two to your head, leak brainial fluid 
 (No please! Starks, don't do it!) 
 Bang bang, no more time for compassion 
 My reactions to your action: Satisfaction 
 No more DeLucas, the rise of a new day 
 Hey, hey, Mr. GFK 
 The rhymes of the black suits no longer play 
 I'm avenged, a proud man walking the Earth 
 Satisfied with my kills and my life's a rebirth 
 So live long, and long live the illest 
 Twelve Reasons to Die, Ghostface Killah 
 (RZA:) 
 As thunder strikes, and the clouds smother the full moon 
 The soul of Tony Starks' son is cats into an abyss of fog 
 And the spirit of Ghostface Killah is [?] into his body 
 Becoming a human inferno of vengeful rage 
 Logan screams in terror, as she realizes her fate 
 The possessed boy begins stabbing her, again, again, and again 
 Now standing alone, blade in his hand, he grins at triumph 
 *Sighs* the sweet taste of revenge 
 Lester Kane and Tony Starks were nothing more of [?] spirits 
 Separated by time and space, but bonded together by violence and death 
 A touch of fate brought these two souls together 
 But for one of them, the ultimate price was paid 
 This is not the last we'll ever hear of Tony Starks 
 Actuality, this is a new beginning 
 Tony Starks was once a man, and became a demon 
 But now lives again, in the flesh and blood

 It's ""bloody choices"" from prophetic voices 
 Anointed by the RZA noises, 4th Disciple and Supreme 
 '98, Red Ant signed us, Cathy was beside us 
 And linked us with Earth, Wind and Fire (you're a shining star)

 Got out our contracts, happily free

 We ain't regular M.C.'s, we prophet M.C.'s

 With four diamond rings, we already been kings

 I speak for the dead souls that's locked in a bean

 All, you're all we got, you're all we got 
 All we got, all we got is us, through the good and the bad times 
 Even though times is hard, I stay divine, shine for God

 And it's a cryin' shame, my brother's lyin' dyin' in vain 
 Supplyin' the game, livin' out the next man's name 
 Complete your steps, we got to move quiet as kept 
 Seen a lot of teens get swept, cause one man slept 
 And all we really got is us, who can we really trust 
 Silly of you, to think that I would hate us 
 Movin' as one, ain't nothin' new under the sun 
 Same fiends, same drugs, same guns, relax a little 
 Focus on tracks and make classes 
 Black sounds of Satin, grace and satisfaction 
 Hold my fans to the very end, we all we got 
 Through thick and thin, we rise as the world spins 
 Feel like I'm locked in a cell, LA the Darkman, Nelson Mandela 
 I gave out consignment, fuck you, nigga, pay me 
 Elementary, dear Watson, gats keep poppin' 
 Drugs keep clockin', and feds keep watchin' 
 So I stay low pro, always keep the calico

 Doreen, Sky, and Kelly 
 Starks Angels, Shaolin's Finest 
 Though it happened in the streets of Brooklyn 
 Plus I played the whip real low 
 'Cause my face was woofin' 
 My Angels jetted outta Albee Square 
 Gun out, wrapped in they hair 
 Kinda crowded so they clapped in the air 
 Chase a nigga down, block for blocks 
 Squeezin' glocks 
 These Mami's real anxious to blow of his top 
 He's a rapist, murderer, convict, burglar 
 The more they ran, the more they skirts got dirtier 
 Sendin' shots like Check Day 
 FedEx Express way 
 **Boom!, Bow!, Bing!** You heard the gun play 
 *Who shot the duck out the window*? Mr. Lee said 
 *Three pay now, you fuckin' weed head* 
 We can stop the fire, the suspect, he's dead 
 Then I pulled up - ""Come on girls to Club Med"" 
 (MF Doom) 
 Stay tuned - The Villain Threes Company 
 Don't Sleep Pt. 1 
 2 Brown sisters assisted the Villain Doom 
 He woked up, stoked like they was still in the room 
 Freed his right arm and leg 
 It was more like a sweep 
 Loosened his other leg, arm, head and rose to his feet 
 Staggerin' except for the socks and mask naked 
 Grabbed up the boxers, fussin', pissed and 
 Checkin' for the keys, stacked 
 A robbery expected, yet nothing obvious is missing 
 Recollectin' now why Hollywood hotties 
 Stepped in Giuseppe Zanotti, personal nurse's 
 Chanel purses, she ok? shottie 
 Chased Patrice with Thai iced teas 
 She drive wild nice to Veggie Fried Rice Spicy 
 Told the Hoes ""I don't feel so well, my belly"" 
 Rolled down Melrose, ""Drive me to the Telly"" 
 ""Y'all go'head and get the L's, and get back, I be 'k"" 
 Feelin' woozy, no oozy, who's seen the lobby? Ray 
 Peace! peace to man, change 100, stop and look 
 Naw! Whoops! Left a knot in her pocketbook 
 Elevator slow, ""is I'm that careless?"" 
 Entered the room and fell flat on the terrace 
 Woke up, dag, who bound and gagged 'em? 
 Got 'em for 2 out of 3 packed bags Magnum 
 Each gram of Villain sperm streets worth a G 
 The part of Mr. Furley was played by Charlie Murphy 
 (Outro: Ghostface Killah) & (MF Doom) 
 Fuck Charlie, that's right y'all 
 We go get back out there on the scene 
 Kelly you go get me some pussy 
 (To be Continued) 
 You know what you gon' do 
 You too Dorien 
 You lil fat ass can't get away neither and shit 
 Uh huh, that's right yeah I'm call The Theodore niggaz 
 Swat Team alert and shit

 (Verse One: Ghostface Killah) 
 Yeah, assorted flavor Clarks 
 No doubt 
 The beer champ 
 Yeah, curly head kid 
 Yo, yo, yo 
 From Gators to blazers, low fades and razors 
 Big dick saloon, I contact the womb; the black asian 
 Which location keeps circulating 
 I want the twin power after day shit on his mason 
 A God steam represent the gummy with the green 
 Who walk fiend stand up on your block and burn a bean 
 Sir Ballentine, lookin' at this bitch walk behind 
 The thing that's fucked up appeal us that's wine 
 They turn around take my last pull off the L 
 These niggas on the block keep looking at me well 
 But they want the jewel it ain't hard to tell 
 I'm recognize his face, he actin' like Denzel 
 But fuck him, I went to check low for chop 
 On a ball gone the size like faith up top 
 Now it's a whole new ball game, strategic mind frame 
 My dialogue's rebellious raid and razor fame 
 Glass out a red light, see Killah get on a ninja bike 
 Show my love to the God he peeled out and made a right 
 (Sound of speeding motorcycle) 
 When you walking down the street with your - Box in your hand 
 And you bringing the music of the - Wu-Tang Clan 
 And you hear Ironman on your - radio rapping 
 Your feet start the dancing and your - hands start the clapping 
 (Verse Two: Street) 
 Street's running through your dancehall gunning 
 Like Lee Harvey Oswald stunning slapping MC's with summons 
 For pumping - that watered down substance 
 Beef there's slugs finger creeping 
 Making moves like Crying Freeman 
 Prince of thieves, earth's third seed 
 Heavyweight like golden fleeces homicides stroll the street 
 If Luther preached it, look at the thugs holding heat 
 In the city beef got me plotting trilogy 
 To the smoke enemies sneak attacks I'm beyond and above that 
 Seen that done that, respect black 
 I catch a slug to your hardhat 
 Lounging in the everglades, surfing the airwave 
 Catch a buck fifty where the razorblades swiftly 
 Shaolin cats be shiesty, strictly 
 Drunk off the Irish whiskey 
 (Verse Three: Method Man) 
 Rest your headpiece on this one sun 
 Cough up a lung 
 Sleeping on my murderous type ones I get you done 
 I'm looking at these cuthroat kids and how they live 
 It's like we was partners in spades and you renege 
 Can't fuck with no nigga like that he get me jack 
 Or sent back, meaning whole life fade to black 
 I'm looking in the half of right and roll tight 
 Fool me once but can't fool me twice, I'm 25 
 To life on this mic device ain't nothing nice 
 A mixture of long wild rice and no spice 
 Inflicted, rap addicted, track I stick it, flip it 
 Daddy long dick-ed, slide 
 A little bit beyond twisted, mind in stitches 
 You thought weak but meant wicked 
 Niggas choke off my second hand smoke lifted 
 Everyday is like my birthday I'm mad gifted, dead calm 
 Hit me with the eighteen bronze, buddah palm 
 About to blow like Napalm, before your arm 
 Prepare for the warfare, or buy a share 
 Oh what the fuck we dealing with, yeah 
 Johnny about to go there 
 Need another year 
 Bust a shot for my sons that didn't make it here"
216,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,Can It Be All So Simple,"It's the remix son 
 Can it be, act like you know 
 Check it 
 Yo, check what happened out of state 
 I'm knocking off a half-a-cake cash rule, flying at a fast rate 
 I smoke the black dust kept my hands clutched, I'm fallin' in lust 
 Spore plush I played my hand like a royal flush 
 Baggy jeans, wallabee clarks, pretty woman 
 I put it in him, shot up in him, deadly venom 
 I hung around the big time bosses 
 Illegal force exchange thoughts, showing love to all my sources 
 Spades tried to bag me, like Cagney, and Lacey 
 Chef had that bitch stacey slippin in Macy's 
 I dose off, catch a flashback on how I got trapped 
 And got licked like papsy in a mob flick I got hit 
 Stumblin holdin' my neck to the god's rest 
 Opened flesh burgundy blood colored my guess 
 Emergency trauma, black teen headed for surgery 
 Can it be an out of state nigga tried to murder me? 
 I should've stayed in job corp, but now I'm a outlaw 
 Ray cartegna, carry a fo'-fo' nigga 
 Can it be that it was all so simple then? 
 Dedicated to the gods and earths 
 Dedicated to babies who came feet first 
 Dedicated to up north and down state 
 Dedicated to rich niggaz who sell weights 
 Dedicated to projects with black kids 
 Dedicated to man who build pyramids 
 Word up! what the fuck yo? 
 We taking you on another chamber 
 Word up son, you know how we be on it 
 Yeah it's real 
 Show these crabs how to rhyme man 
 I think it's time to bless them, word up 
 Bulletproof 
 First chamber 
 Yo chef yo 
 It started off on the island, ak shaolin niggaz wildin 
 Old folks scream : stop the violence! 
 True layin up yo, watchin these crack niggaz 
 Playin' nuff crap games for what see? 
 Back in days, crime pays in mad ways 
 Sportin tommy hil with caves 360 waves 
 And no searchin for loose ends, now flex 300 benz 
 Mad 10's with mad diamonds 
 Now that's the life of the good life, sometimes niggaz act trife 
 I paid the price throughout my hood life 
 Remember I got blasted, now that's in the past kid 
 God forbid I lay in the casket 
 But now I'm all about g-notes, no time for weed, mixed with coke 
 I wash my mouth out with soap 
 And I got my act together, 'lo sweaters and better 
 And fat leather, so whatever, bring it on 
 Can it be that it was all so simple then?"

 Maybe he'll find her, maybe he won't 
 Oh wonder that love

 Brothers try to pass me, but none could match me 
 No girl can freak me, I'm just too nasty 
 Lost on the dance floor as I attack y'all 
 Snuck through the back door, guess who they saw? 
 Goldie and Ghost, black African Rose 
 Star-studded low lenses, plus the mural was dope 
 Airbrush W-B's, STOP! (Shake your body, body) 
 And cop a couple of these (She's a hottie, hottie)

 Scottfree and Chauncey, very upset 
 They're sick and tired of living in debt 
 Tired of roaches and tired of rats 
 I know they are over

 Brooklyn jumpin' - it's girls by the thousands 
 Heart-throb music - girls come out your blouses 
 Shakin' ya ass - it's Cherchez Laghost 
 She could hustle with a sick style - jump off the boat! 
 Everybody's in the song - no bad boys 
 Scene hot and muggy - you might end up in the wrong house 
 You hear the feelin' - snatch that boy 
 He a herb - catch him for a brand new toy

 They'll love you one second, then hate you the next

 Tony's his name, the undefeated champion, whoa, yeah

 Always will be my friend, Ghostface Killah

 Wally champ so amazin, the suede shoelacin 
 Up in the Sheraton, just got hit for five years probation 
 I got a dental appointment at two o'clock there go my gold ring 
 Much later catch a flick or go hoeing 
 Yo there's somethin' heavy on my mind from last night's crime 
 Spoonface shot Gel in the back with Kiv's nine 
 It was two men, tighter than a hiker with Tims 
 Like blood brothers, problem was they lust each other woman 
 For instance, Gel seen Spoon in DeMoore 
 He wet his whiz (tle), got his seed an headin towards the door 
 They came out of eye, face to face, they embraced 
 Gel blew a kiss and looked Spoon girl in the face 
 Her face lit up, and grinned with a smile like what? 
 That sneaky f--k, same bitch that got my man hit up 
 Out in Brownsville, where the thug life live to kill 
 Where bodies is worth two for five 'cause it's real 
 Fast life... 
 Fast life, cause there's nowhere I can go 
 Fast life, that's the only thing I know 
 Fast life, cause there's nowhere I can go 
 Fast Life, that's the only life I know 
 (Verse Two: Andre Rison) 
 Yo my man got more power than gunpowder with ammunition 
 Blowin' up the fireworks and the n----z ambitions 
 On the come up, she gettin' done up, behind closed doors 
 Doin' freaky s--t, on elevator floors 
 I want her, like Sonny wanted Cher 
 She was his diamond piece, sex wasn't for lease 
 Rest in peace, somebody came up deceased 
 R.I.P. on that grave of the slave of infatuated ways 
 God couldn't save 
 F-A-K-E, L-O-V-E 
 Fake love you see 
 Never lasting through eternity 
 Living life in the fast lane 
 The fast life... it's the fast life 
 Fast life 
 Fast life, cause there's nowhere I can go 
 Fast life, that's the only thing I know 
 Fast life, cause there's nowhere I can go 
 Fast Life, that's the only life I know

 No average white boy, my style's too ferocious 
 Puff trees on the block and I've slept with the toasters 
 Dug out Janet, jacked off on the posters 
 Sold explosives, bottle rockets by the grosses 
 First taste of big money, now I need double doses 
 Don't need no features, we got Ghost to host us

 Guns too big, they won't fit in the holsters 
 And we sittin' on top of the world, killin' y'all roaches

 The scene's marked, got them six in a pack for 3.99 (It's yourz) 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Bulletproof goose pillows 
 I'm still alive since the last time I left 
 Tephlon pajama set, truck armor neck neck arm weigh your head 
 Move a A-Bomb, get drunk and paint the whole town red 
 Fuck a 5-0, hydro and perfume bottles 
 Blow a hole through an avocado, blitz murder Verrazano 
 Wish that I became a leader, the day this old school nigga 
 Placed a burner in my hand, 'cause I was very eager 
 Big stories to tell, jail house, rock that Supreme Clientele 
 Bricks we buy and sell, we made it, it's on, when fam post bail 
 When they ran up in, near the house, Pops went through hell 
 2 O'Clock, the Apollo on, no socks, wallo's on 
 Eatin' olives with Vodka, lampin' on plush sofas 
 Big trophies on my wall, double X Moses, Ghost is 
 M.C. Ultra, you be surprised by the size of my hostler, bitch 
 The reason why I be dissin' y'all niggas is cause y'all 0 for 6 
 You hero head muthafuckas, I'll expose you quick 
 Fuck around and get your waffle split 
 Y'all morocco when I cock let the glock go, got those bridge 
 Feelin' like a bad parent when I dropped those kids 
 Body up your fuckin' man just like the Narco's did 
 (Outro: Ghostface Killah (Solomon Childs)) 
 Yeah, yeah, like I told you (for real man) 
 Muthafuckas, you need man (tired of niggas tellin' niggas) 
 Fuck that, it's Theodore (niggas talkin' all flagrant)

 Let me say somethin', let me say somethin' one time (go head) 
 I'mma bust one of these niggas wigs off 'em one time 
 My banger too big and been starvin' for one of these little punk ass niggas 
 (Yo these niggas like bad children) 
 I'mma start sendin' y'all niggas to the storm 
 (Where we from, y'all niggas don't know, fuck the rappers, God) 
 Y'all niggas whole style is chunky, straight up and down 
 We them '88 bankies, man, on the real man 
 (Y'all niggas just war story niggas) 
 I'll smack you off stage while you on man

 Spit in your girl's mouth, bitch (Shaolin, I fuck the bitch up)

 Yeah y'all, hey y'all 
 Dangerous thoughts mine of a malicia 
 Bottles at the one fifty poured over twisters 
 Broke in boons the pillers stack now is the illest 
 The biggest land feel as we creep like? 
 Love raises, dirty guns with a few bodies, 
 If this niggas tired of walk again, from the fucking shawty 
 Six sin, six pack, six degrees just? 
 My evil thought our blinks with no hesitation 
 Thus back spoon fools the sugar help the metty 
 Go down smooth and steady growin' the green deadly 
 And weed pops isolated of hash bricks 
 And me left stuck in this arm doubt of the bad face 
 We still rock, still ride cross in the stove 
 God breath back in the days as growing some more 
 True packs back, my glock's fat after the guns spoke 
 You're screaming where my block at 
 I go hard like is ? bacteria 
 Poke so hard he got the power to avenger her 
 I go hard earble T kid the cleanser, 
 I go hard LA the white hour, 
 Lungs pounding hard too much smoke in the... 
 Fire plus iron evaporates the enemy 
 Jason stat hammer mechanic all mechanically 
 Write about now I can't really use the realisy 
 I go hard like you never thought I could 
 Run swing with the hammer the nails in the wood 
 My iron fist the story take a look I think you change your? 
 Veninous and dangerous 
 And they think they know you 
 Till one day they show you, 
 So no matter what they say I go hard. 
 And I think it's over, but it's never over 
 'Cause you now you think I'm down I go hard."

 This was my favorite girl for years, 
 She knows the way I perform 
 Sometimes I pull my boxers down, y'all, with one Timb on 
 It be times, you know I stay away when her friends on 
 For some reason, she be really 
 Hot, when her friends gone 
 That's when I slide on over with a 
 Guinness on the stouffer 
 To talk a little shit, then get a little closer 
 Like, what up boo, you know that Ghost loves you 
 I get butterflies when we hug and kiss, do you? 
 Huh? Answer me, let me if it's the truth now 
 That pretty mole above your lips looking cute now 
 Ooh child, I'm patient, my mind's telling me 
 To stay calm, I wanna get it off like a G bomb 
 On top of your skin, I'm sliding it in 
 When I'm done, you can wake it up and ride it again 
 Then we can hold on through the 
 Night, fan on and covers on 
 It's bright from the TV light, peace, good night 
 (Tre Williams) 
 Looking out my window, sun shining bright 
 Birds are singing, trying to make things right 
 Now I got music, oh, on my radio 
 And I can hear love songs playing, behind closed doors 
 Now I don't want no one, on the catch me side 
 But ever since you left, said goodbye 
 (Chorus: Tre Williams) 
 I wish you were here with me 
 I said I wish you were here with me 
 I wish you were here, with me 
 (Tre Williams) 
 And thinking bout your kiss, gloom all around me 
 Seen our love, is never gonna find me 
 And I keep looking, oh, for that brighter day 
 When all I see is, time slipping away 
 Oh and I got to talk, to keep myself together 
 But all I see is stormy weather 
 (Tre Williams) 
 Now I got to get, get myself together 
 'Cause I can't take no more, of this stormy weather 
 Now I wish you were here with me 
 I wish you were right here 
 I wish you were here with me, ooh 
 (Tre Williams) 
 Night falls and I call for you, love 
 But there's no one here to answer 
 No, no, no, oh 
 The wind blows and I turn to catch ya 
 But there's no one there but my reflection 
 No, oh I said I wish you was here with me>"

 I think it happened on a Saturday 
 I heard the phone ring, ding, ding 
 Who this? 'Vine yo... 
 Wise guy killed last night by the Tracks, 
 It was the same who our niggas teeth up 
 Sent 'em back, we shoulda thrilled a long time ago 
 We went this recording, now we owe 
 The devil slit trough, without an intro 
 Yo 'Vine, it can't be! 
 Wise guest-starring me 
 Can it be, we both got hit 
 God legendary, he and General 
 He survived A-dog, 
 Hard to even picture god eaten by gray dogs 
 He stayed in his world 
 And he sidely sweard 
 To tell the truth, that DeVon was like 
 ""Your out of cure boo"" 
 Wisegod Allah, warrior 
 XY chromosome, sat heavy on the throne 
 Touched something for you 
 Ya stupid fail niggas fucked up 
 Becouse bitches is talking 
 They living, I'm twisting 
 You alleybag 
 You killed my man, you killed my man 
 And you sent him back 
 After this day, watch your hats 
 Slugs flying everywhere, 
 You could smell heaven in the air 
 You can never get the god, yeah 
 Now I'm cypher, 
 You've been driving off the same battery 
 We had, back in '91 that got you hyper 
 God been beautiful, god been great 
 God fed you, you died but we survived that day 
 You killed your king, Rakeem Allah 
 Gave him his life, he was your offspring 
 Camouflage dog, days was green 
 One righteous man fought for his right, gods pupil 
 Yo, that's my fam, we snatch me out of big head van 
 We tought you how to get gain, from sayin' ""peace god"" 
 As long we translate Allah's tongue, spit the language hard 
 Alley thoughts, identical twin 
 My alias gasanate, the days close, 
 The days close, how'd you know! 
 (The Dramatics) 
 Once the sun comes out and the rain is gone... 
 I know I'm gonna see, a better day 
 I know I think I'm crying, because of you 
 I'm crying, don't want you to see me cry 
 Love you Wise, love you Wise, love you Wise! 
 I wanna go outside, in the rain... 
 It may sound crazy, it may sound crazy 
 But I wanna go outside, in the rain..."

 It's a Thin Line Between Love and Hate 
 It's a Thin Line Between Love and Hate 
 It's five o'clock in the morning and I'm just getting in 
 I knock on the door and a voice sweet and low says 
 (Who is it) She opens up the door and lets me in (let me in) 
 Never once did she say where have you been? 
 She said, (are you hungry), are you hungry honey, (did you eat) 
 Yeah, let me hang up your coat 
 The woman says, pass me your hat 
 And all the while she's smiling 
 Never raises her voice 
 It's five o'clock in the morning and I don't give it a second thought 
 It's a Thin Line Between Love and Hate 
 Don't think you can keep breaking your woman's heart 
 It's a Thin Line Between Love and Hate 
 And you should sit back and enjoy it 
 (It's a Thin Line), Yes it is, yes it is, (Between Love and Hate) 
 She gonna fool you one day 
 The sweetest woman in the world, can be the meanest woman in the world 
 (If you like her that way) 
 You keep hurting her, she keep being quiet 
 She might be holding something inside, she gonna hurt you one day 
 Now I'm laying in the hospital, bandaged from feet to head 
 In a state of shock, just that much from being dead 
 I didn't think my woman can do something like this to me 
 I didn't think the girl had the nerve 
 Here I am, I guess actions speak louder than words 
 It's a Thin Line Between Love and Hate 
 Don't keep thinking you can keep treating your woman bad 
 It's a Thin Line Between Love and Hate 
 She won't ever get mad 
 (It's a Thin Line), Yes it is, yes it is, (Between Love and Hate) 
 She's gonna fool you one day 
 (It's a Thin), It's a line thin, (Line Between Love and Hate), between love and hate 
 It's a Thin Line Between Love and Hate 
 She's gonna fool you one day 
 (It's a Thin Line), Yes it is, (Between Love and Hate)

227,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,It's That Wu Shit,"O, most of the time, yo, I'm flicked up 
 Stepping out the crib like I'm sixed up, don't get it mixed up 
 Even if I'm shaking your hand, I'm still gripped up 
 With two spots left, yeah, we still bricked up 
 Trees pine, gleem no seed, young boys feeling they self, they must be on E's 
 Me? I stay outted out, boating on oceans 
 He banging my old chick, and he mad open 
 Think I smell the goons, they been business since the Tunnel days 
 Shanks out, they ready to move 
 Somebody yelled out 'ballin' 
 In two seconds, lord, they was up on 'em 
 That voice, should of slowed down, baby 
 Now what we gon' tell his lady 
 Jaw on the floor, looking all crazy 
 A lot of vicks been going down in here, lately 
 In 2012, the DJ is still recognized as the crowd controller 
 The record breaking, keep the bottles popping and all the ass shaking 
 It's that Wu shit, it's that movement 
 It's the Wu shit, in the house 
 Yo, should I talk about all the jewels I wore on my neck 
 While you had to tuck your little shit in out of respect 
 I'm a done, rebel out of Staten Island projects 
 I dare y'all to come in my projects 
 Leave with no head, no neck 
 You thought I was Flex, the way I bombed the set 
 In the hallway, banger house, smelling like cake 
 Tongueing bitches down, most of them got scraped 
 Watch how I move the crowd, I'm a make 'em, make 'em clap to this 
 No shit, no doubt 
 Two shots of Hennessey, ladies want Goose 
 Earlier them fronting niggas, now they want a truce 
 Mami got a bubble in her Jimmy Choo shoe 
 When I go and kick it, she's a goodie two-shoe? 
 Yeah, right, daddy got bread 
 Like J. Holiday, I wanna put you to bed 
 Tell me your girlfriends, kicks, don't let it go to your head 
 Walking around in your cheap ass threads 
 Get away from me, stinky 
 Yeah, yo, I spit lines from the rubble room 
 Bottom line, I kick mines, like a mother's womb 
 I'm, still in my prime, fuck them other dudes 
 No biting's the rule, but we can eat each others food 
 Flash a camera at the all time great 
 Single handing increase New York's crime rate 
 That's why I love it in the Empire State 
 The city where your fat ass can still find weight 
 But y'all ain't getting it, the game is different 
 And in the recession, a lot of veterans is quitting it 
 Every day I'm living it, your boy got blunts 
 Fighting after school, a lot of y'all got jumped 
 Staten Island, bro, ratchet under my coat, potato salads so 
 And we silencing that, just every day challenge us 
 Check a nigga out of respect, I'm spectacular, this the Massacre"

 We gon' take a little walk around Eminem's pond 
 To a nice beautiful place, where 50 got rich 
 Far far away, from the drug dealer shit 
 Down deep in the bricks, where the thugs kill shit 
 I'm gonna keep reppin' my hood, and I ain't gonna stop 
 Fightin' to get paper, while the pistols pop 
 These police hate me, and want to close my shop 
 Yeah, street flavor niggaz, me and my Goon Squad 
 Mixed with Theodore, kid, bang my tunes hard 
 Bang bang, be Don, be doin' my thang, thang 
 Especially when I go hard for God 
 And a special ed' bitch respect my retard

 Paid us money? (Yeah, comin' in, all right?)

 I'm in the 0-5 Benz, with the suicide doors 
 Lazy eye lights, and the apple suede floors 
 Mossberg jacket, Carmine's, number six 
 My guns out the windows, reload it like The Matrix 
 I'm tryin' take this back to '86 
 Where the chains are hollow, and silly rabbits had 'tricks' 
 We all pose like jail flicks (word) 
 And them nicks was like twenties 
 We ain't rock Christ heads, we had Playboy bunnies 
 And Jordans to, I rocked ones in '85 
 I'mma rap, but I rhyme, just to stay alive 
 No jive, we fam, like the Jackson 5 
 Twisting the Gerder, one leg on the wheel as I ride 
 No low profile, I need meat on the wheels 
 And the law gonna help me get a mil for reals 
 Big business, billion dollar funds for deals 
 All protein, son, I need steak for meals 
 Keep your scampi, pa..."
229,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,Laced Chebba,"Your Kung Fu is good, your magic is good 
 That is why he waited, so my power would dwindle 
 My power has diminished, then he come to kill me 
 Yes, but, I know your Kung Fu is still very good 
 If you practice again, no one could possibly be your match 
 Oh, the ancient weapon 
 Yeah, fierce, I travel across seas on glaciers 
 Four shoguns that got fucked by geisha's 
 Still gracious, still able to twist out darts 
 Just grew tougher skin from swimming with them sharks 
 Broken ankle, fucking with them Wallabee Clarks 
 Got them bitches still screaming my name (""What up Starks?"") 
 I'm a bone crusher, ox'll split your face like a dutch master 
 No more minks, it's polar bears from Alaska 
 With shark skin Air Maxes and igloos of ice 
 Rocks clumped up, like overcooked rice 
 I'm nice, you're the reason why the game went soft 
 Bland niggas, I come through and season your broth 
 Like Mr. Dash, I blast, I'm a menace like Dennis 
 Young Coles, and I'm back from a six month sentence 
 Rehabilitated, back in the yard, flying heads with barbwire's 
 Stay tying niggas to beds 
 Can you kill me? 
 If I didn't think so, I would not be here waiting for you now 
 Right, let me see what you got 
 Forget the tricks, let's see your kung fu 
 Yo, everybody get paid, everybody get laid 
 All these bitches dirty, everybody got AIDS 
 Everybody get played, everybody get sprayed 
 Everybody do what I say, everybody my maid 
 P, crack selling, black felon 
 Gat clap, rat-a-tat-tat, tap melons 
 Son thugs, one gun, one slug 
 Shot caller, like, yo, let me speak to Young Muggs 
 Listen, it's Mandela, pa 
 I grab wack MC's, I smack 'em hella hard 
 I kill niggas with the birdy big banger 
 My Wu-Tang niggas call me the thirty sixth Chamber 
 Lyrical miracle, spit with you rap dudes 
 Get smacked off the skateboard for not paying rap dues 
 P, call me the gate keeper 
 Break haters off your face smoking laced cheeba 
 Ha ha ha ha, he's mad, listen to me 
 You've lost your concentration, your magic is gone 
 That's why it doesn't work, you better use your real Kung Fu 
 Yeah, aiyo, she want a thug, not the lawyer type 
 A golden boy to promote it right, sorta like a ill De La Hoya fight 
 I'm eating good, enjoying life, flawless ice, quick to bag a baller's wife 
 With no strings attached, cordless mics 
 Toilet white S five fifty with the wrong pipes 
 Peeling off like snake skin, watch the cobra bite 
 Over night success story, go and check for me 
 You rap poorly, that's why your cassette's corny 
 Your money too short for long convo' 
 You in the game hurting, trying to play Rajon Rondo 
 Millionaire swag, peep your boys ensemble 
 Jewels heavy, Prince Akeem, Coming to America 
 Etcetera, whoever sent the kite, kill the messenger 
 Because I think like the man behind the register 
 Quick to pull a toaster out, Starks choke 'em out 
 We over here, counting bread, what y'all loaf about? 
 You finished already? Get up and fight 
 Hey, let's get some strength 
 Let him go till he outlive me

 Creepin' through the crib is Maxine pot holdin' down with the grits

 He ran into Caesar room, grits down crying aight with his balls out 
 He stepped on Clarences' Biggie Smalls album

 Jumped on him pigeon toed Mookie poured dye on him 
 You should've seen his motherfuckin face fryin, half dyin' 
 They stuck a fork through his nuts 
 The little girl was happy she picked a brotha up 
 Quick pick the window up Mooney over heard 
 Right before they threw him out the Nigga said ""Word!'!""

 Blood brains splashed... he was dead' and the cops never came

 Watch out! if you don't have the v.i.p. lacq' out 
 Them big dollars they talk 'bout, just turn around and walk out 
 You better watch out! exotic fabrics, speech in larynx 
 Think it's mid-day traffic, runnin' game like the mavericks 
 Makin' time seem elastic when we stretch out and smash it 
 Then vanish like a phantom and hurt my understandin like what??

 I know, I can't afford to stop

 I know, I can't afford to stop 
 For a moment... that it's too soon... to forget

 So you said what, now? You got the whole shit twisted 
 That was the other day, pa, you just like them bitches 
 Faggot ass niggaz, stay bumpin' they gums 
 Tell me why you were dirtyin' cops out, you never run 
 Are you holdin' something in? That the hood don't know 
 'Cause if you are, get to truckin', bitch, 'cause you gotta go 
 It's not a threat, it's a promise, I tell you, don't make your mamma feel it 
 You'll be rockin' a toe ring in the morgue, give problems to revealin' 
 (Chorus: Ghostface Killah) 
 Y'all niggaz kill me and y'all, y'all know y'all booty 
 So please get your punk ass off the street 
 Please, please, do it for your family 
 Don't be stupid, don't make me use it 
 No, lord, 'cause you can't sell here, anymore... 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Did you think I was playin'? When I told you before 
 You can't come back here, open you up like a pap smear 
 Actin' like you ain't got fear, nigga you get popped here! 
 Matter fact, I'm a street doctor, take the shot here! 
 Blaow, yo, I didn't smile, so, take off your jewelry, now then 
 So what you leg is bleedin' here, put this in your mouth and 
 Chew on the barrel of love, get lost in ""lead-you"" town 
 You look thirsty, I should of wet you down 
 But not now, you hear those sirens cryin' 
 Climbin', tryin' to Save Private Ryan 
 Bitch, nigga on the floor for lyin' and he whinin' 
 Diming on niggaz, minin' your business 
 Perfect timin' for findin' bullshit sliders 
 Swine and sisters, he a wack nigga"

 They love a nigga's spirit like Pac at the Coachella 
 They said Pusha ain't fit with the umbrella 
 But I was good with the Yay' as a wholesaler 
 I think it's good that 'Ye got a blow dealer 
 A hot temper, matched with a cold killer 
 I came aboard for more than just to rhyme with him

 Hold up, I ain't trying to stunt, man 
 But these Yeezys jumped over the Jumpman 
 Went from most hated to the champion god flow 
 I guess that's a feeling only me and Lebron know 
 I'm living three dreams, 
 Biggie Smalls', Dr. King, Rodney King's 
 'Cause we can't get along, no resolution 
 Till we drown all these haters, rest in peace to Whitney Houston 
 Cars, money, girls and the clothes 
 Aw man, you sold your soul 
 Naw man, mad people was frontin' 
 Aw man, made something from nothing 
 Picture working so hard, and you can't cut through 
 That can mess up your whole life, like an uncle that touched you 
 What has the world come to, I'm from the 3 1 2 
 Where cops don't come through and dreams don't come true 
 Like there the god go in his Murcielago 
 From working McDonalds, barely paying the car note 
 He even got enough to get his mama a condo 
 Then they ran up and shot him right in front of his mom 
 40 killings in a weekend, 40 killings in a week 
 Man the summer too hot you can feel it in the street 
 Welcome to Sunday service if you hope to someday serve us 
 We got green in our eyes, just follow my Erick Sermon 
 Did Moses not part the water with the cane? 
 Did strippers not make an arc when I made it rain? 
 Did Yeezy not get signed by Hov and Dame? 
 And ran to Jacob and made the new Jesus chains? 
 In Jesus' name, let the choir say 
 ""I'm on fire, ay,"" that's what Richard Pryor say 
 And we'll annihilate anybody that violate

 And my eagle, still got it all in the bag, B 
 All you did was play possum 
 Yo, come on 
 Six hundred Cuban cigar in the big tub 
 Medallion on, Dove soap on the fresh cut 
 With soap suds on the Mac-11 
 My big lion haven't ate since twelve 
 And it's after seven 
 We feed the nigga like forty chickens 
 His tail wag when I send him a bag with just one victim 
 Uh-huh, now let me show you what my closet on 
 Gems in the display case, call it a rock-a-thon 
 I got soccer moms paying for cock 
 Asians get it from behind while they cleanin' their wok 
 Coming with flows that's toxic 
 Deadly fumes when I'm in the room 
 Repercussions occur when you try and snitch 
 Red light, green light 
 One, two, three 
 Look mean, got my machine 
 Cried and hit you, please 
 Say shake that body, scar up that body 
 Should I kill him now Ton'? I said probably 
 Side bets, I form better 
 Bust hammers with pot holders 
 And yo, dead a cow for his fuckin' leather 
 I'm not bow-legged but old school like red fox 
 My favorite colour in my hustle days was red tops 
 My gold eagle arm shitted out a red rock 
 Threw it off my project roof, saw red dots 
 Kanye, shine a light on my Wallabees 
 You can have a good time with G.O.D

235,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,On My Knees,"I can't fall down on my knees 
 (I thought you loved me) 
 (If you really loved me you would have stayed with me) 
 And apologize to you 
 (And apologized to me that's all I'm askin) 
 But that ain't my style 
 (Well let me hear wat you had to say earlier) 
 I remember how me met 
 It was on the train 
 How could I forget. 
 You smiled when you looked at me 
 The soft of your lips that captured me 
 The whole ride down 
 We kept our eyes on each other 
 And then me sat, down together 
 You gave me your number 
 Said 'give me a call' 
 I thought I wouldn't call at all... 
 But here we are 
 Fell in love 
 Like hand to glove 
 Pure bliss from above 
 Now all we seem to do is fuss and fight 
 We never seem to get it right. 
 See there's too much fire so much desire 
 So I took a little pill to take me higher 
 I'm sorry if I hurt you when I ran astray 
 I guess I got caught in the day- heyey 
 I can't fall down on my knees 
 And apologize to you 
 It not in my style (x2) 
 I remember the night 
 When we were all alone 
 You were on the sofa 
 I was on the phone 
 You over heard me call out my best friends name 
 That's when you went crazy 
 Started going insane 
 Grabbed the phone from my hand 
 Backed me against the wall 
 Shouting and askin 'who was on the call?' 
 You would believe me 
 When I said it was just a friend. 
 That's when all the madness began 
 You kept yellin' while I stuck to the floor 
 Cryin all these tears, I can't cry them no more 
 I knew you had a temper 
 I wish I didn't see it 
 You wanted me to be faithful 
 I said I could be it 
 But that didn't stop you 
 From puttin' your hands on my face 
 You said you simply had to 'put me into my place' 
 At the end of every tunnel 
 There's always a light 
 And the door will show whose right 
 I can't fall down on my knees 
 And apologize to you 
 Cause it not in my style (x2) 
 He's got you begging on your knees 
 Crying in you sleep 
 Making you believe him 
 But you're stronger 
 Then you'll ever know girl 
 You control your own world 
 No need to take no more! (x2) 
 Verse 4:(Rap) 
 Hey yo yo yo 
 I asked you to calm down 
 Asked you who was on the phone 
 Put the horn down 
 Had a glass of wine 
 From a 99 yeah a green one 
 Which I bought for you from the cruise you won 
 I dun approve of those male friends 
 I told you back then when we first got together 
 That I don't trust those men 
 And you did it again 
 I lost my temper 
 Blinked out and wrecked the house boo 
 That's all I remember I'm sorry (sorry Sorry) 
 I can't fall down on my knees 
 And apologize to you 
 Cause that not in my style (x4)"

 Slot machines, ding-ding-ding-ding-ding, when they ring off 
 Lock the doors, that's when Ghost just g'd off 
 Cigars, paisley robes 
 Four bitches guardin' me safely as we walk to the window 
 The cashier was scared, she asked for my info 
 The manager arrived with two guards, that's an insult 
 That's the cause, just because 
 We talkin' bout 5 million dollars here, this ain't Play-doh dough 
 And your horoscope read, you gon' slay those lows 
 We got scribbes, Anthony Acid, rockin' the show 
 Special guest: Starks / Mark Ronson 
 First five hundred bitches went crazy he let them on and in 
 All he did was plug me in, I got the chargin' 
 Got they bras and ran through they whole apartment (la-la-la-la, lalalalalala)

 I'm hangin' wit the ballers, yeah, or my nigga Ghost 
 I can tell you what they say haters, if you wanna know

 When I'm roll in my Mercedes, all the ladies wanna roll 
 Be my Juliet and I can be your Romeo 
 If you actin' menace I can pick another hoe 
 Ooh weee (la-la-la-la, lalalalalala) 
 In the middle of the summer, or even twenty below 
 I'm a bad muthafucka, I'm way to fuckin' cold 
 Let me tell you what they say, when I'm pullin' off my drawers 
 They say ooh weeeee 
 Aiyo, aiyo 
 My games here to party, just to cut up a rug 
 Don't make me wanna cut up a thug 
 Now play something for D.J., 'cause there's nothin' but love 
 Hosted by the ladies who lookin' for somethin' to rub 
 When we roll out, we roll on dubs, rollin' up bud 
 The Theodore Unit, we controllin' the club 
 Mamies, shakin' they ass, they throwin' it up 
 Like a B.E.T. commercial, I'm ""wrappin' it up"""

 But these colors 
 You might wanna catch that alligator

 Champions wrap bills in jeans 
 Since we spend like tennis records, 
 Andre Agassi tennis shoes and jackets 
 I take my ? out the bridge of my nose, 
 The Gucci is cool, but they are not originals 
 Those are like digital clocks 
 Mind shuts till grows up 
 What a loop scooper troopers 
 And my blaze do and my? 
 We hear shouts 
 Everybody got an eighth day 
 I get a nice stay, nice waves, wait a minute 
 Slice gang, chop it up, slop chop, I'm saying 
 You can't, I'm not dancing, 
 Acting like they should

 Real lyrics, well here we go, I'm a tell you a little story 
 That's right, watch this shit, nigga, here we go, y'all, your ass 
 Yeah, we write for days, hot shit, uh-huh 
 Dope, drugs, sex, murder, King James version 
 Aiyo, needle was left hanging, in the arm of a pimp 
 He walk with a limp, had bitches on the payroll 
 He gave the seeds candy and his family was poor 
 Drove a '68 Caddy with the fur on the door 
 The other macks ain't have jack on him, not even Goldie 
 Slowly, he would rise, kept his runners with the police 
 Jim Brown was his man, his brother was Muslim, they tried to convert him 
 And turn righteous, but the streets got the good of him 
 Big hats with gorgeous stones, honey designed the slacks 
 With two attempts on his bottom bitch, her name was Precious 
 Silky skin, priceless pussy, she took karate 
 Her bubble ass got Pretty Chipp rich 
 You can smell her perfume on every street corner 
 A sexy motherfucka with the mean face on her 
 Precious, sported bulletproof dresses, defending caring sex 
 Thirteen smith, this boo that study her lessons 
 She was the key to Pretty Chipp riches, bitches is fortune slang 
 Control the south side, her name rings 
 Lookout for the black cherry pussy extortion 
 Any other hoes get pregnant, bet they get an abortion 
 Back at the pub, at the Alice spot, bumping the sounds of Curtis 
 Playing Live in the jukebox, this broad named Cookie 
 In the purse, fifty thou' in cash 
 Passed off to Chipp, told him count it fast, another 10 in my bloomers 
 Fuck the rumors, it's lies, baby, you my daddy 
 Bitches never saw me jumping out of Dirt Dog's cabby 
 I'm a loyal bitch, and chicks can't stand me, pimps 
 They know I'm ill, that's why they never put hands on me 
 From Fillmore Slim to Goldie, Pretty Toney 
 Frank War told me, C.C. get that money 
 My potentials, credentials, my mouth stay hot 
 Like Chinese mushrooms, wasabi with spicy lentils 
 The other day I brought a little gat, where I keep near my lower back 
 Cause these niggas don't know how to act 
 At the Apollo, Ray Charles told me 
 Bitch just get in the car, 'cause I want you to swallow 
 I jumped in, and his bodyguards follow 
 He was quick, I spit the nut on his '74 wallos 
 He wanted to invite me to Chicago, I said 'nah, daddy' 
 He pushed me out and lit up a Marlboro 
 (Nah, papi) 'Cause I'm from New York 
 He taught me the talks, he taught me the walk 
 'Cause I'm Chipp's bitch, we dine and resort 
 Only nigga ever taught me, don't put swine on my fork 
 And that's the truth, rest in peace, papi 
 This Cookie, I still got another tall Goose for you daddy 
 I'm a stick in the grave for you, baby 
 Fuck them other pimps, they ain't got shit on you, daddy"

 I'm not a fan of this, I'm a mic vandalist 
 Thug therapist, my clan's too original 
 My slang bang to wax, words that's visual 
 Too digital for why'all common street criminals 
 Who want to come test, lick the sweat from my genitals 
 We can get off the mic and get a little physical 
 I was born to rock since they cut my umbilical 
 Cord, I swing swords, behold the prolifical 
 Rhyme writer, hip-hop provider, prize fighter 
 Live wire, quick to set the mic on fire 
 I speak legalized dope, hitman for hire 
 I quote murderous notes, dope rhyme supplier 
 Hang glide on the mic like a stunt driver 
 And I won't stop rockin' till I retire

 You woke up four gorillas wit a makeover 
 Packin a punch, asthma pump takeover 
 My crew boards, and the whole plane lays over

 Pass the pussy, get out, date's over

 Now tell that shit to the court, I plead no contest 
 From none of why'all, please 
 I potty train pissy-ass rugrat for free 
 Keep the cake for the family and off Sarah Lee

 With a million people waitin' 
 I've been saved, fuck my caves, those is just gifts 
 Just imagine if we all wit one page 
 Think alike, A, be alike, see alike 
 The proper knowledge is needed 
 Wit' Satan off my back, I'm at peace at night 
 No more cops, no more Rodney King's 
 No more peekin' out the curtain wit' the rifle by any means 
 AIDS don't exist, plus my sex life's terrific 
 I get a kick out of life, I bet my bitch on it

 I just can't go on 
 Fellin' the way I see, ooh

 Oh what a beautiful vision it would be to see 
 Every man, woman and child flow in harmony 
 But it's so hard in these gritty streets of New Yiggy 
 And every state infested with cobras, mocassins and rattle snakes 
 We hate, battle jakes, escape the thirst before the love of freedom 
 We travel many beaches and leeches 
 Black drums, kingdom comes slum better first day won 
 No limitations, no hesitations, we stay sun 
 Even though I went through hell strivin' to come out right 
 Carryin' heat, survival in these concrete streets 
 From the '70s era chrome beretta, story of the hood 
 Terror always stood these streets better 
 True princess, sun I'm tryin' to live my life more better 
 Soundin' like the strongest of weathers 
 Smooth as feathers, the grand loyal 
 All from the blood of royal 
 A hard head makes a soft ass 
 And never spoilt, feel me? word up 
 (Hell Razah) 
 We spend our lives in the ghetto 
 Enslaved by the plague of the devil 
 In the graves, we all settle when we raised by the metal 
 Crack vials made us act wild 
 Gangsters look where we at now 
 Behind prison gates or buried in grounds 
 Role models of a child mis-educated, wanna be down 
 They gave up fake smiles, along with the pounds 
 How much time does a man need to notice you bleed? 
 And that the God you don't believe is the reason you breathe? 
 Blessed be the poor, playin' their numbers inside the liquor store 
 Next door apartment to me, is only coke wars 
 Caught four before Allah, we broke all the laws 
 I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, when ever we caught 
 Jum broads became strippers when they used to be Queens 
 A lot of us became sleepwalkers followin' dreams 
 Solomon Kings, that's why we like diamonds and rings 
 Pussy and CREAM, with vanity is what it could bring 
 (Outro: 60 Second Assassin)

 Give her a quick chance to kiss glance 
 In the mix, I saw the bitch sniffin', just dance 
 Slept on a peel, then broke her wrist, and burnt her quick

 And that goes for any nigga who think that they better than me 
 Punch in his face, fuck him up mentally 
 Real robe and pop my throne 
 Pop a cop if he show signs of any kinda stop my flow 
 This is real life lyricist, never a witness 
 See me clappin' the tools, improve my wrist 
 The dude is, the ruger is super steel 
 Fall back, take a look at my face, for real 
 My attempts to kill, sent a gate to chills 
 When his brain hit the windshields, brake ills 
 (Chorus: sample) 
 Burn it it, aw, burn it 
 And you know, got to have them set it 
 Burn it, aw, burn it 
 What a life, not a life, ha, ha, ha, hahahaha 
 (Trife) 
 Yo, get hooked like syringe with dope in it 
 And you a dummy like crack bags with soap in it 
 See, well I'mma got a scope with it, drama don't approach with it 
 Blow you off the coast, now your momma got a coat with it 
 Young nigga, smokin' marijuana with the coke in it 
 Sellin' CD's, VCR's and the remote with it 
 Easy, duke, man I need this loot 
 Look at my face, all hairy like some kiwi fruit 
 Dead serious, showin' no teeth, holdin' my heat 
 Put his eyes in the back of his head, he goin' to sleep 
 For fuckin' with a top boss, niggaz get knocked off 
 I always drop shit for the streets like a cop's horse 
 Nigga you cock soft, scared to pop off 
 And I spit fire, my tongue's dipped in hot sauce 
 It'll burn you, toss and turn you 
 Have you bleed internal, get popped like kernels"

 Pull out my gat, she though I was goin' shoot her 
 Mr. P Crakk Cocaine, I got rulers 
 My mind in the gutter, and my heart in the sewer 
 I kick a bitch to the curb, I keep it movin' 
 Married to the game, I love my money and my music 
 Half Puerto Rican and black, they think I'm Jewish 
 I don't give 'em shit, and they keep comin' back to it 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Now come and sit yo big ass down 
 Right here on daddy legs, now hush, take a sip of the brown 
 Lap dance on it, leave a white stain on my Levis 
 This the twat team, I'm a show you how we ride 
 Through a lasso over your hips, rustle your mean thighs 
 You bow-legged too? I'm a hit it from all sides 
 Uh huh, we brought the bar, you bought the bar 
 Beans got the big lighter out, waiting to spark 
 Word up, dance floors, noise, asses shaking 
 And she winding that body like she got Jamaican 
 Asians, sistas, blacks, bad Caucasians 
 Get 'em all Goosed up, then I persuade them 
 To bounce to the c-r-i-b

 You bring your lil' male friends, I get kicked out"

 That's right, we gotta get this darts right 
 Spray y'all niggas on some marksman shit 
 Yes, I said, ""Look, I got ready to graze 
 Took my hat off and the crowd went crazy 
 Bitches threw their panties, the sound man was fannin' me 
 The whole place was standin', G 
 What they chant, we was family 
 Jumped in the crowd and I swam to sea 
 Threw me to the back, surprise, I still had my chains on me"" 
 Dana Dane, front row bitches, I bang all three 
 Say, ""Yo, Meth, fuck it, throw a Jim Brownski 
 Versace, banana color robes and my socks be"" 
 Them Billie Jean shits and they real Rocky 
 The fans can't knock me 
 I bench Coliseums while Genius spot me 
 Plus I'm cocky, bitch 
 Once I took off the hoodie, revealed the face 
 Cop patrol couldn't control the place 
 I got groupies backstage, lined up at the gate 
 The signs up, yellin', ""We love your tape!"" 
 I'm sorry I took so long, didn't mean to make y'all wait 
 But good things take time to create 
 You can find me in your studio 
 Half baked, eatin' ganja cake 
 Tryin' to make my next release date 
 With Ghost, Street, GZA, great minds relate 
 You know a brother bond is hard to break 
 When we perform we cause the Earth to shake 
 Ain't nothin' changes, it's still those same niggas 
 You love to hate GZA 
 I set examples over amplified samples 
 That's scratched in the club, ducks begin to trample 
 On those who fell victims, body loss they souls 
 These beats when I picked 'em 
 Jones played the role, soldiers brave and bold 
 RZA paid the roll, GZA buries the scrolls 
 Then months later it was, then years later it was 
 Written on loose leaf, that old formula 
 That was stolen by a new thief 
 The journalist watched it, critics couldn't knock it 
 A piece of history that they carried in they pocket 
 With the time factor, speed was the order of the day 
 What a delay, they were able to, what he would say 
 Why waste the slot time of the ridiculous rhyme 
 That's only excused by a generous mind 
 I kept 'em stored in the shelters like the goods in cans 
 'Til I turned rap villes into harvested lands"

 Take this shit like a shot of Remi 
 Bend over let me introduce you to Rover 
 Until it's over 
 Now you sober 
 Put your leg back on my shoulder 
 I'm a scrub like you 
 And plus one piece of ass'll just can never do 
 My new 75 wives's coming through

 Had to be home no later than 2 
 And the 2 twins with the hour curfew 
 The light-skinned females one's you call Boo

 On the road trying to sing 
 Yeah you a queen but see-Donna ain't your king 
 My dress code switch it make you want to swing 
 A little episode 
 I would have done it before but now you look old 
 Sex on the first night that's how I roll 
 Fronting on a crust being assed in the cold 
 Try to play live what? 
 Lady on a stroll 
 Rack my Versace but can't pay the toll 
 All Cappuchino women why'all got to go 
 The love that I feel for women is untold 
 Sweet or sour ladies if you got babies 
 If you wanted to hit a nigga off in the eighties 
 Jump in the Mercedes girl it's all true 
 The way I feel about you!

 They love the way I dress captivated by my charm 
 If you see me in the cut I'm just steadily calm 
 It's a regular females be under my arm 
 Ever since I got paid to start dropping the bombs 
 I could take 2 women my nickname is LONG 
 Crushing is involved I'm doing the James Bond 
 Grant you a fantasy then I be gone 
 That's under the hat the way I made you come back 
 From the shoes to the hat 
 All of my shit match 
 I'm like a book of matches 
 I'm always on strike 
 I'm double-jointed I can do it how you like 
 Come to Keisha house 
 Yeah it's only right 
 We can get together for a glass of ice 
 And if the kids here something we can tell them it's a fight 
 I love my 2 seeds more than my own life 
 It's hard to escape punani appitite 
 I see a pretty face I start falling in love 
 No matter what baby girl I just can't get enough 
 Because THE WAY I FEEL ABOUT YOU!

247,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,The Black Diamonds,"I warn you shit face! 
 I pick who I'm gonna bury next 
 Say your prayers fast, 
 'Cause you're about to feel my arm in 
 Freedom of speech, watch how I reach my potential 
 I stay on the hunt for dope tracks and instrumentals 
 Travel the world, found black diamonds in the Everglades 
 Fought temptations, slap-boxed in the devil's cage 
 The globetrotter, spot rusher 
 I bust in your mouth like a gusher, it's Wu-Tang motherfucker! 
 ""Iron Man,"" I cock my music in the chamber 
 I'm God's gift, heard I was born in a manger 
 Danger! Cosmetic face rearrange you 
 Leave you slumped on the chessboard, found by a park ranger 
 Burst of adrenaline, bungee jumped off the Verrazano 
 I sky dive in some sky blue Ferragamo's 
 Ran the streets heavy, kept my charms chunky 
 You damn right I fuck fans and I keep the munchies 
 Guess you must be, the four dog fist champion 
 (I've heard of this devil's kick, of course yeah) 
 (Everyone knows in the Kung-Fu world) 
 (It's a method that's never been defeated yet) 
 Ha ha ha, and won't be 
 I suppose I should warn you 
 I've been given good money, to kill you 
 Yo, loose cannon, forty-deuce flicks, two parrots 
 Lay back at The Palace like Mike Harris 
 Callous, fly nicest, metallic bang mallets 
 Fly your whole cabbage to Paris 
 The black Pat Garrett, karats on Donna Karans 
 Guys die tryin' to drive the McLaren 
 Islamic, burn chronic out on the terrace 
 Angelic, your body lie cold without spirit 
 My finest hour, you're sacrificed to a higher power 
 Fly from the tower, I fry sour 
 And buy powder, 40 Cal give your pal a shower 
 You shit in your Calvin Klein trousers 
 The night prowler, your life is ours 
 Knife your Eddie Bauer, leave you pushin' up flowers 
 You ain't counter chip counters 
 Them niggas is pimps, your bitch shouted 
 The 650 get clouded 
 You'll see! I'm a master now 
 And whoever insulted you, pays with his life for this 
 That I swear! I'll fight now 
 (Okay, not bad) 
 (Patience, you've not seen it all yet) 
 Yo, gun or beef, I don't discriminate, beat dudes black and blue 
 Snack on crews like they food, takin' space up on my dinner plate 
 Dependin' on my mental state, the mood that I'm in'll make 
 Me charge like a bull, pull the tool out and ventilate you 
 Sin-ner takes you down, lace your crown, face get found 
 Full of rounds from the pound, that detonate when they penetrate 
 Can tell you always been a snake, you don't move like I do 
 Imitators hate the fact that they can't do what I do 
 I'm mindful of my rivals, I can smell 'em when they slide through 
 Provide you my arrival, still won't even get a side view 
 Won't know that life is over, till I'm standin' right beside you 
 It's not that I don't like you motherfuckers, I despise you 
 The other different pedigree, not cut from the same cloth 
 Stay G'd up from the feet up, while your heart pump duck sauce 
 I love it when they tough talk, my guns lust to bust off 
 But every time I squeeze they call police to bus me up North 
 Sin-ister the Finisher, they label me a menace and got 
 Mad when I laughed at the judge durin' sentencing 
 Not, glorifyin' prison but I'm built tough for biddin' 
 See survival of the fittest shit I live it e'ry minute 
 Every hour to the second, I'm granted my respect 
 Never catch the God in the yard, sharpenin' the weapons 
 Got, shooters on demand, new recruits to the Clan 
 Sticking everything movin', more loot for the fam 
 Ain't a damn thing changed, just say the name bitch

 Exit stage left with the cash, gone took it 
 Off like a koufi, the fit was a bit doofy 
 He tried to get screwy, with that ""two for you, 
 One, two for me, G,"" cut the cranky attitude 
 Wet him like a handkerchief on a stanky fatter dude 
 Whether you's a rapper or dang sanger 
 Once you in the zone only one way out, like a gang banger 
 With a new crew keychain and street name 
 What set do he claim for fame, peep game 
 Just to keep feta and stay dip 
 You need it like a letter or better a getaway whip 
 This old things rusted, encrusted as the gold rings the old kings busted 
 Plan to end global starvation and fat her 
 Now what in tarnation did I go and do that fer? 
 Stuff happens, like gettin' snuffed for tough tit rappin' 
 See, I told 'em enough, quit yer yappin' 
 The same applied to any and all chumps 
 The only question he had for y'all is how many lumps? 
 Three or four? either or? mon cheri amour 
 See, why you need your heater for? 
 The super villain slid in your party for free 
 Warn a emcee, get outta here kid, you bother me! 
 The day I took my mask off my face was missin' for two days 
 For the record, G, came back a year later, whole new identity 
 Tony Starks pedigree, my money green like my nickname was celery 
 Who is Ghost who flashes toast, never wore sheets but bulletproof coats 
 Oh no! the fans cry for the mask back on 
 Told 'em ""Ghost is dead, he'll return at the crack of dawn"" 
 Few years from now, him and his pals before the Jetson-era arrived 
 He'll be back summertime, 2000 and 5, with a half a face iron 
 The other half water look like alien science 
 In the summertime, you can see the face boil 
 But the other side I keep blue with the Penzoil 
 Mad loyal, when the wintertime come, (what?) 
 I get stuck 'cause my brain all numb 
 Like I ate a thousand icee's and frozen Pepsi's 
 Aquaman's pops can't water-check me, disrespect me, indirectly 
 I seen his feet and they both lefty, he's steppin' half correctly 
 As I stroll the globe and terrorize the planet 
 With a Bill Clinton mask and them Playskool hammers 
 Me and DOOM, always be the best on the landin' 
 Superhero's for life, until our souls vanish"

 Take us back to eighty eight, you couldn't catch our flow 
 A group of kids, so original, (you heard?) 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Tony 'Tana with big hammers, for bad manners, who got 'em 
 We kiss cannons for Scrams and his crew, and his wack dancers 
 Biting is forbidden, pa, pay that tax 
 And don't you ever look at us funny, come on, boy, we'll bring rap back 
 And that'll hurt you like Superman, chased by a group of men 
 With dynomites, real hip-hop'll do you in 
 Floor you like Dyu Ku Kim, I'm loo-looing 
 Hoola hoop on bitches, cuckoo for brand new pins 
 Cut Masta Killa, make sure we cut classics 
 Buck bastards in broadday and tuck caskets 
 Next to Uday and Qusay, hopped in the coupe, shoot the P.A. 
 And just lay, whooptie, whooptay 
 Use to lose spaldings, and snatch a dude's toupee 
 Since tuning in, to T-La Rock and A.J. 
 Ghostface gats is freshed squeezed like a glass of O.J. 
 Girls you can go cruisin in my O'Jay"
251,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,Tony/Montana,"I play hard for nine innings dressed in fine linen 
 Cause pussy is the best next thing besides women 
 All the position I've been in couldn't explain how I'm living 
 My vision my intuition has risen 
 Here take a listen I'm hitting 
 Up to bat with precision 
 Sealing bags in the kitchen 
 Slinging crack to these pigeons 
 For the fact that I'm driven 
 My linebackers is missing 
 Send you back and good rides 
 Trapped in this mission where snakes and rats is forbidden 
 Keep my gun hidden niggas is bitches signing petitions 
 And they providing convictions 
 See I survive through the system under the livest conditions 
 My riders ride on a mission for snitching 
 You get your back blown right out of commission 
 You'll be missing like them crazy Christians and swimming with all the fishes 
 Your misses will come and visit your body with hugs and kisses 
 Now tell me is that nutritious we party with chips and liquors 
 Your wisses is coming with us for real kid they bought me presents 
 The difference is this is business big biscuits big figures 
 We click on religious niggas for acting too superstitious 
 Move cause the group is viscous 
 Shoot if you want your wishes to blow 
 See trife in the Bentley with a group of bitches 
 My design is already made 
 So young an so strong 
 And just waiting to be saved 
 My life's no longer in the hands of district attorneys or envious niggas 
 Who thirsty 'cause I'm OT with prince with thirty moving like magic 
 But niggas ain't worthy like Michael cooper when I shoot I aim sturdy 
 Mother maiden mother fuck em 
 Rhymes so dope I hope I make it through customs 
 We can take it to the streets like a game at the rucker 
 They claim they love us but all that changes 
 When you on and they fucked up dog ain't no flaws in a hustla 
 I ain't no longer in state greens and chuckers 
 Waiting for the beach port and the breaks streets oughta relate 
 I see it all in your face the window to your soul ain't tinted 
 You want to see me falling from grace 
 No way nigga I'm stretching my weight like cocaine dealers 
 What they gonna say now the flow way iller 
 If dough change things I'm no longer the same 
 But what I became does not conflict with from where I cam 
 I was dealing with caine like cold chilla back when lyricist rained 
 And dope was killing em, any MC who think they ill as me 
 Or real as me should chill I mean that's your opinion 
 But my raps is relentless like a mac with an infra 
 And I'm back with a vengeance, like Sprewell smashing the Knicks 
 After they shipped him despite the fans resistance 
 Big and 'Pac is up top so the nicest man living is right here 
 Its quite clear like diamonds that glisten"
252,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,Who's The Champion,"(Feat. Rza) 
 Word. Man fuck that nigga 
 Fuck that crab, ass, bitch {Who the live niggaz youknowhatI'msayin?} 
 {You niggaz know how to shoot joints} (Put down the gun son) 
 {Elmira, Riker's Island, coming from Brownsville} (Put down the gun son) 
 Niggaz tried to front on my little sister (Put down the gun) 
 {YouknowhatI'msayin we represent youknowhatI'msayin?} 
 {YouknowhatI'msayin? Big Tony Rhome, peace to my man Tony Rhome} 
 They tried to, tried to front on this (Put down the gun son) 
 {RZA respect youknowhatI'msayin? We keep it real} 
 Yeah, check it out y'all (put down the, put down the gun son) 
 {Put your guns down, throw your hands up} 
 It's on like that y'all word up, Iron Man comes back 
 {Represent, you niggaz gotta shoot joints} 
 Yo check it 
 (Verse One: RZA) 
 Put away your heaters, throw up your dick beaters 
 Accurate blows to his nose shut his eyes closed to a centimeter 
 Bitches on the fences wonderin what the fuck the suspense is 
 I land heavy uppercuts in the corner of the park fences 
 Knocked his mouthpiece front teeth got locked inside my knuckle 
 He grabbed the belt buckle, attempt to catch me with a couple 
 Of low blows to the nuts, on ringside was as a giant du-els 
 Send your Barb for this fuckin' jew On a Wire 
 He couldn't chessbox that's when he reached for his ahhs 
 Brother chopped me on the top of my knot, but he got stopped 
 When a twelve ounce bottle of Bartyle and James had him startled 
 A bitch threw it caught him in his head, at full throttle 
 He fell, the glass crashed, he wasn't saved by the bell 
 That was his ass black 
 So when it comes to physical combat 
 We can take it hand to hand or go beyond that 
 Do you want my gat to make the contact? 
 Retirin cats who lack the heart to fire back? 
 (We take all crabs overboard) 
 (Chorus: Raekwon) 
 Put down the gun son, son matter of fact, shoot the one on one 
 Hold it down, make sure the head, sure nuff don't hit the ground 
 Lampin on the handball courts, or the square, we can take it there 
 Settle it son, who the champion? 
 (It's like that, niggaz want to front, one more time? 
 I'ma show you like this. One on each side 
 This is it word up. We gonna lay you back 
 We gonna rest your back, you won't know how to act 
 When it come to bigger, showin and provin 
 Niggaz styles is wack) Who the champion? Settle it son. 
 (Verse Two: Ghostface Killer) 
 Yo! 
 I had to run up on this King at Devine, for his shines 
 He saw the stash and caught my mailbox for eighty dimes 
 He saw me stashin, like a pipe-link for mega fiends 
 I held it down like the finger fly miraculous King 
 Peep through the heavy small get the camoflouge 
 Starks master in charge, pushin through ery buildin, sippin egg nog 
 Niggaz know my status God body carry big batters 
 Fiends know me for my blue bags, besides smackin crabs 
 And earnin mine, this bitch Sha cat, gotta get his back bent 
 What the hell just made him fuck with my intelligent? 
 Back to Polly and I heard some noise we pack a two twelve 
 There go Lord Shamel, faggot made a sale 
 He's sellin my shit, I should slap fire out his ass 
 Snap his bones in half and watch the stock market crash 
 I walked up on him, he had the nerve to say Peace God 
 Ain't nuttin Peace God, you stole it now we out in the streets 
 Take your shit off, nigga you soft, back up off 
 Youse a shady nigga, I'm a sever fig you with a gloss 
 I snuffed him, threw a crazy left and I cuffed him 
 Allah don't like ugly so I held back from bustin' him 
 I passed the burn off, he caught me from the blind side 
 Tapped a nigga jaw, I shot my fifty-two style, and crazy raw 
 I had my ice on, tapped a few times, he started leakin 
 De King with the deadarm, Shamel fell to his knees and 
 He started wheezin, losin his breath from smokin' trees and 
 I'm still breathin, bleedin because it's frontin season 
 Now I got that project belt, international/national 
 Worldwide, I let Shamel slide"
253,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,Wu-Blood Kin,"Young Gods when you shout them guns you kill sons 
 Can't get into the pen for murder one 
 I rather be rich, lay back and spark that shit 
 Killed now son of being hit by a bullet 
 Yo, the garden of redemption, half of my clan is fenced in 
 For being lynch men, never listening 
 Like Sonny Listen on Riker's pisten, 25 was no surprise 
 He shot 3 niggas left one paralyzed 
 With bloody palms, them niggas tried and raped his moms 
 Start shooting at his chest 
 Shells went to his charms on Saint Nicks, call that branch 
 The weed spot kid, 2 niggas dead, history, like a pyramid 
 He mailed the cleaves to an island off the Florida Keys 
 Bent out, Dunn had a 3 story penthouse 
 450 see on SouthPeak 
 Young fakes made the move on the New York street 
 Extraordinary he flipped his man to see the nigga bury 
 Check the sub though, heat key Joe Colombo 
 Got a kid welled out in Florida on the low 
 Pushin' a Benz-O, sips O-O and mo' 
 He selled his smoke out the store, Boe kicked in the door 
 Bran was in the back gamblin' with 2 pounds of green on the table 
 My Dunn escaped out with guns stable 
 Of course, he fucked up sniffing white whores 
 The German's in his laboratory with the task force 
 Bring it too hot we self cock the full five 
 First sneaky hit the back caught a shell through his eye 
 He screamed, the rest of his police team 
 Got ripped to death like a 88 jeans 
 Young Gods when you shout them guns you kill sons 
 Can't get into the pen for murder one 
 I rather be rich, lay back and spark that shit 
 Killed now son of being hit by a bullet 
 Nigga shut the fuck up and drown the keys in the pool 
 Keep your cool feds be knocking on the door soon 
 Said they heard about that cat you murdered the boom boom 
 You shoulda swooped on 'em stayed Wake Water do 'em on him 
 Jet skied on 'em then flew around corner on 'em 
 4 o'clock in the morning, I threw the ski mask on 'em 
 My little man's on the corner when I plant it on 'em 
 357 slug nosing on 'em 
 Some bitches that was bugging for him you know 'em 
 Some bitches problem still be holding 
 20, 25 years on 'em they growing 
 Now back with the shit with the twelve burner to be on it 
 12 O'Clock is on it Darkman on it and niggas don't want it 
 Young Gods when you shout them guns you kill sons 
 Can't get into the pen for murder one 
 I rather be rich, lay back and spark that shit 
 Killed now son of being hit by a bullet 
 Young Gods when you shout them guns you kill sons 
 Can't get into the pen for murder one 
 I rather be rich, lay back and spark that shit 
 Killed now son of being hit by a bullet"
254,Ghostface Killah,hiphop,Youngstown Heist,"For the city, to get this money, Vegas, yo, yeah 
 Here's the rundown, Mustafa's getting money out in Youngstown 
 Get some goons together, a driver and bring them guns down 
 Heard he had his hands in some bricks, plus a few pounds 
 Hang with some wild Haitians, settle shop in the dude lounge 
 Niggas is migrating, he came from Cue Gardens 
 With a live situation, got it in preparation 
 When you get there, pick up the whip with the navigation 
 And follow all the clowns till you get to your destination 
 (We here Tone, got our masks on, we bout to run up in 
 I know you ain't talking 'bout the house, with the broken henge 
 65 Alpine Drive, it's looking shady 
 So I hopped out, pulled the glock out, plus the 3-18 
 Hit the living room, I've seen a ripped up sofa, a shattered coffee table 
 Broken lamps, and a flipped up stroller 
 The place was ransacked from front to back) 
 Yo, Trife, what you talking, black? 
 (Yo, Starks, cut the bullshit and tell me, where the office at) 
 Take a left and head, down the hallway steps 
 Pass the painting on the wall, the third door on the left 
 The safe is on the wall above the fireplace near the decks 
 Look inside the top drawer, and get the key out the chest 
 Damn son, aiyo what's taking this nigga Trife so long (I don't know) 
 Oh shit, yo Bull, get down, get down, get down 
 Look at Stark pulling up, son (aw man) 
 I'm a try to kill this nigga 
 Aiyo, hurry up I see a car pulling up, windows tinted 
 Can't really tell who's in it, but, I know it's a rented 
 Down south plates, Atlanta or, one of them states (yo the cameras on) 
 Man, I wanna see what's up in those crates 
 Should I pop off, take his top off, before he get to you 
 Bully like (Yo, chill, chill, this is what we gon' do) aight 
 (Go ask for directions, right, I'm a go around the back 
 Wait for them to come inside, I'll hit these niggas with the mack) 
 OK, before it even get to that, let me see where Trife is at 
 Hopefully he on his way, and no one gotta die today (bang bang) 
 Two shots go off (Homey trapped inside, quick put the mask on, Sheek) 
 Fuck it, Bully, let's ride 
 Shooting out the sunroof, missing and shit 
 I was too high, still think my Dutchie was lit 
 Trife running out the building, busting, cussing 
 Blood everywhere, you had to see this shit (disgusting)"
