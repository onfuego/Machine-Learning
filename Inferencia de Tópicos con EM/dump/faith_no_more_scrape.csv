2,Faith No More,rock,Mark Bowen,"Love...it's a beginning 
 A justifiable means to an end 
 And happiness, that triumphant feeling 
 Only comes from within 
 But you'll never make the grade 
 No you'll never, ever reach that plateau 
 You're down below 
 And it's where your soul will forever glow 
 But it's not that ray of sunshine that feels so warm 
 It's just that bottomless inferno 
 You're in the depths of hell 
 And I think that's swell 
 And I hope you get well 
 Well done, fried in and out 
 Burned to a crisp, if that's what I wish 
 I didn't write these rules 
 I just follow them to a tee 
 'Cause that's me, I'm evil 
 I'm hateful, I'm sinful, forgetful, mistrustful 
 I'm diseased and contagious 
 I'm suicide, homicide, genocide, pesticide 
 I'm a human bomb 
 I'll kill anyone 
 And so are you, So don't be coy 
 Cause you too can destroy me like a toy 
 Not like Mark Bowen 
 He never done nothin' to no one 
 That didn't deserve it"

 You must be scared of something from the time before, well

 How long, who knows? 
 It's not your right to tell me where this trip will go 
 Pull away, you're dying today 
 You could enjoy it 
 If you could take your feelings with you 
 But put your mind on me and suck my energy 
 And see the speed gets higher 
 I see you hold on tighter 
 Tighter 
 Tighter 
 But just fatigue 
 Is all your face will show 
 It's weary from the stress 
 Getting delirious 
 I didn't want this race 
 We can""t keep up this pace 
 We don't want to get well 
 We want to go to hell 
 We want an urban dream

 This time was mine to borrow 
 I'll pay for it tomorrow 
 You'll pay for it today 
 And as we drive away 
 I'll make my pleasure greater 
 Push the accelerator

 All I 'm really doing is yelling

 Through the hollow tombs can see them 
 Through their mouths I can hear them praying for pain 
 But it's only a game 
 Listen man, I know 
 That things are really rough 
 And everybody gets you 
 And life is really tough 
 But I know that deep down inside 
 There's a feeling that rides 
 All the way to the end, oh 
 Thursday you sit in your room 
 With the lights turned out 
 And you don't answer the door 
 Friday morning looks sunny and bright 
 Like it's going to be a good day 
 And it would be if only you had a job, oh 
 Time is on your side, you're young 
 Don't waste your time today, oh"

 Then stick back 
 Stick your chest out 
 Stomach in

 Wooh 
 Do you really know? 
 Where the harems go? 
 In the desert snow?

 An oasis dream 
 Doesn't really seem 
 To mean a thing

 Put your guards up

 Up, down 
 Forward march

 Cold, cold, cold 
 I feel cold"

 She was a loving girl, he was a caring guy 
 Together they had plans 
 They were married and had a baby 
 His name was Johnny 
 Wait a minute, that's me 
 Why am I only three years old again 
 Spinning and spinning and spinning 
 There was no gleam in your eye 
 When you passed us by in the parade this time 
 You had nothing to say 
 And you're always on your way somewhere 
 But today you just stood still 
 You were a quiet kind of person 
 Who asked for nothing and got just that 
 So they sent you away to kill for your country 
 Could you blame him? 
 Can you blame him? No 
 And in the end 
 When we meet again we're friends 
 Will we ever learn that we are only God's children 
 And God never made moral decisions 
 God made love"

 Now is the time when you can do anything. 
 Everything you do, anything, it will still turn out great.

 Around again my sleepless one 
 Your friend was young, hung and plastered 
 He never knew his own disaster 
 I think it's good, in fact it was faster 
 'Cause it was you that he was after 
 Hold me now 
 As if you'll never let me go 
 Unhand me now 
 As if you've always known my name 
 His love was king, his love was master 
 He needed more, he needed always 
 He searched in vain for love and shelter 
 In every soul, in every hallway 
 So you thought she'd be sweeter than your girlfriend Peter 
 Well give it a second chance 'cause you've yet to meet her 
 We got the same ideas, we got the same old fears 
 They're different colors sometimes, but hey hey, who cares? 
 Just years that tears our lives apart 
 Just like the time that you tried to teach your cousin to walk 
 He couldn't do it-push!-you told him twice 
 Well, I do man but it just don't jive 
 Tried so hard to control my behavior 
 I tried so hard, so hard to believe you

 Resolution slips away again 
 Right through my fingers, back into my heart 
 Where it's out of reach and it's in the dark 
 Sometimes I think I'm blind 
 Or I may be just paralyzed 
 Because the plot thickens everyday 
 And the pieces of my puzzle keep crumblin' away 
 But I know 
 There's a picture beneath 
 Indecision clouds my vision 
 No one listens 
 Because I'm somewhere in between 
 Of my love and my agony 
 You see, I'm somewhere in between 
 My life is falling to pieces 
 Somebody put me together 
 Layin' face down on the ground 
 My fingers in my ears to block the sound 
 My eyes shuttin' tight to avoid the sight 
 Anticipating the end, losing the will to fight 
 Droplets of ""yes"" and ""no"" 
 In an ocean of ""maybe"" 
 From the bottom, it looks like a steep incline 
 From the top, another downhill slope of mine 
 But I know 
 The equilibrium's there 
 Indecision clouds my vision 
 No one listens 
 Because I'm somewhere in between 
 Of my love and my agony 
 You see, I'm somewhere in between 
 My life is falling to pieces 
 Somebody put me together 
 Back and forth, I sway with the wind 
 Resolution slips away again 
 Right through my fingers, back into my heart 
 Where it's out of reach and it's in the dark 
 Sometimes I think I'm blind 
 Or I may be just paralyzed 
 Because the plot thickens everyday 
 And the pieces of my puzzle keep crumblin' away 
 But I know 
 There's a picture beneath 
 Indecision clouds my vision 
 No one listens 
 Because I'm somewhere in between 
 Of my love, my agony 
 You see, I'm somewhere in between 
 My life is falling to pieces 
 Somebody put me together 
 Between 
 Of my love and my agony 
 You see, I'm somewhere in between 
 My life is falling to pieces 
 Somebody put me together (between) 
 Somebody put me together 
 Somebody put me together (between)

22,Faith No More,rock,The Real Thing,"I know the feeling 
 It is the real thing 
 The essence of the truth 
 The perfect moment 
 That golden moment 
 I know you feel it too 
 I know the feeling 
 It is the real thing 
 You can't refuse the embrace 
 No 
 It's like the pattern below the skin 
 You gotta reach out and pull it all in 
 And you feel like you're too close 
 But you swallow another dose 
 The pinnacle of happiness 
 Filling up your soul 
 You don't think you can take any more 
 You never wanna let go 
 To touch the roots of experience 
 The most basic ingredients 
 To see the unseen glitter of life 
 And feel the dirt, grief, anger and strife 
 Cherish the certainly of now 
 It kills you a bit at a time 
 Cradle the inspiration 
 It will leave you writhing on the floor 
 This is so unreal, what I feel 
 This nourishment, life is bent 
 Into a shape I can hold 
 A twist of fate, all my own 
 Just grit your teeth, make no sound 
 Take a step away and look around 
 Just clench your fist and close your eyes 
 Look deep inside, hypnotize 
 The whisper is but a shout 
 That's what it is all about 
 Yes, the ecstasy, you can pray 
 You will never let it slip away 
 Like the sacred song that someone sings through you, through you 
 Like the flesh so warm that the thorn sticks into, into 
 Like the dream you know one day will come to life 
 Try to hold on just a little longer, stronger, stronger 
 It's the jewel of victory 
 The chasm of misery 
 And once you have bitten the core 
 You will always know the flavor 
 The split second of divinity 
 You drink up the sky 
 All of heaven is in your arms 
 You know the reason why 
 It's right there, all by itself 
 And what you are, there is nothing else 
 You're growing a life within a life 
 The lips of wonder kiss you inside 
 And when it's over the feeling remains 
 It all comes down to this 
 The smoke clears, I see what it is 
 That made me feel this way 
 I know the feeling 
 It is the real thing 
 The essence of the truth 
 The perfect moment 
 That golden moment 
 I know you feel it too 
 I know the feeling 
 It is the real thing 
 You can't refuse the embrace 
 This is so unreal, what I feel 
 Flood, sell your soul, feel the blood 
 Pump through your veins, can't explain 
 The element that's everything 
 Just clench your fist and close your eyes 
 Look deep inside, hypnotize 
 Yes, the ecstasy, you can pray 
 You will never let it slip away 
 Yes, the ecstasy, you can pray 
 You will never let it slip away 
 You will never let it slip away 
 You will never let it slip away 
 Like the echoes of your childhood laughter, ever after 
 Like the first time love urged you to take it's guidance, in silence 
 Like your heartbeat when you realize you're dying, but you're trying 
 Like the way you cry for a happy ending, ending

 Are you getting a breath of fresh air? 
 Forever longing to make you mine 
 But I can't escape your stare... 
 Liquid seeps into your lungs 
 But your eyes look so serene 
 It's wonderful how the surface ripples 
 But you're perfect, and I cannot breathe 
 Forever longing to make you mine 
 But I can't escape your stare... 
 Hold me closer, keep me near

 Hold me closer, keep me near

 Memories flashin' through my head 
 Was I just born or am I dead? 
 Yesterday's forgotten, the morning after 
 I can taste you, I can hear your laughter 
 Fading in the distance 
 Recollections drifting 
 Bloodstains on my tattered clothes 
 Each minute the fear grows 
 If I could just lay down to rest 
 I'm tired of searching for myself 
 If I am dead, how can I feel such love? 
 If I am dead, why am I dreaming? 
 If I am dead, where do I go from here? 
 If I am dead, why does this pain feel so good? 
 Is this my blood dried upon my face? 
 Or is it the love of someone else? 
 It tastes so sweet, just like you used to 
 So rescue me my love, splice us together 
 I remember loving you so much 
 But where are you and where's your fatal touch? 
 When I closed my eyes, was it my siesta? 
 Did I encounter a darkness stronger than sleep? 
 If I am dead, how can I feel such love? 
 If I am dead, why am I dreaming? 
 If I am dead, where do I go from here? 
 If I am dead, why does this pain feel so good? 
 I am thirsty for my sleep

 It takes the sun out of the day

 And the grandest frappe 
 Well I ain't gonna pay 
 Trimming the tree, I can hang, I won't swing 
 It's only a test 
 Buy it, I'll pry my seat 
 Buy it, from the children's graves 
 Buy it, hear the angels sing 
 Buy it 
 All the zombies walk on Black Friday 
 It's a riot at the salad bar 
 Predatory lenders 
 Safari mission is far but you paid for them 
 To kill your mom 
 Buy it 
 Kill 'em now 
 Buy it 
 This is only a test"
88,Faith No More,rock,Motherfucker,"Force fed more than we eat in the wild 
 Grazed on a mash that can suffocate a child 
 Bloated, promoted in an ode to pomp and style 
 Moistened in the feed while we choke upon the bile 
 Corner in the market on the geese without the bones 
 Hushing out the public in a strike without a drone 
 The cage became collapsible, our sticks equipped with stones 
 Get the motherfucker on the phone, the phone 
 Get the motherfucker on the phone, the phone 
 Get the motherfucker on the phone, the phone 
 Get the motherfucker on the phone, the phone 
 Get the motherfucker on the phone, the phone 
 Hello Motherfucker 
 My lover 
 You saw it coming 
 Set aside the scruples in a stratagem of strain 
 A smallpox-laden blanket, invisible with stains 
 Inoculated bastards, bloody pecked pain 
 Distemper has a hold, distemper has a hold 
 We took a second sip from a cup we made of bones 
 The first sip was a ruse, a trick so aptly thrown 
 The truth is that our youth was a carpet laid with stones 
 Get the motherfucker on the phone, the phone 
 Hello Motherfucker 
 My lover 
 You saw it coming 
 Goodbye Motherfucker 
 My lover 
 You saw it coming 
 Get the motherfucker on the phone 
 Get the motherfucker on the phone 
 Get the motherfucker on the phone 
 Get the motherfucker on the phone 
 Get the motherfucker on the phone, the phone 
 Get the motherfucker on the phone, the phone"
89,Faith No More,rock,Matador,"When lonesome came over me 
 A future shadow 
 Her ghost stood there, sang to me 
 Farewell, so long 
 I’ll awake you 
 From this living sleep 
 We’ll walk the shore 
 Where you were born 
 In bed with me 
 Although I cheat off your things 
 March forward, my son 
 A battle beyond frozen hills 
 Only for dawn's here 
 We will rise from the killing floor 
 Like a matador 
 The stained glass 
 Of bovine eyes 
 Can see right through 
 Every truth-soaked lie 
 Letters will trace every step 
 Out of this world 
 And every ditch, every ditch 
 We will be where you will be no more 
 No more 
 The stained glass 
 Or the hangman’s ass 
 We served you well 
 Now we’re coming back 
 Out of the wake cross this ghost 
 We’ll jump the gates 
 And left to rise, we will rise 
 We will rise from the killing floor 
 Like a matador 
 And the dead live 
 (ah) 
 May the dead live 
 (ah) 
 And the dead live 
 (ah) 
 What more can we give? 
 (ah) 
 Let the dead live 
 (ah) 
 May the dead live 
 (ah) 
 And the dead live 
 The dead live 
 (ah)"

 Welcome home, my friend 
 There'll be no more sleeping on this forest floor 
 Open heaven's door 
 Around you, 'round you

 'Round you, 'round you 
 Around you 
 Comin' 'round the bend 
 Welcome home, my friend 
 There'll be no more weeping like a canyon gorge 
 Hear your lion roar

 I can see you shining like a morning sun 
 Hear your lion roar 
 Hear your lion roar 
 (Around you, 'round you) 
 I can see the parade 
 Welcome home, my friend 
 We come back to history in present times 
 Watch your watch unwind 
 We've been turning mysteries to nursery rhymes 
 Sigils and more signs

 Watch your watch unwind 
 Back from the dead 
 I can see the end

92,Faith No More,rock,The Perfect Crime,"Girl listens to Mom 
 So she lights a match and pretends to sleep 
 While everything burns 
 Man drives nowhere 
 So he pressed the pedal, hit a few dogs 
 And felt good 
 Boy hears teacher's words 
 So he closed his eyes and stepped in front of a train 
 Woo! 
 Woops, sorry 'bout that 
 It's just an accident 
 Revenge nobody forgets 
 Chop it into bits 
 The bitterness is hard to hide 
 It smells like homicide 
 Just nod and say it's okay, ooh 
 I can hear your voice echo 
 Okay, I lied 
 It's really the voice of the guy who kicked your head in 
 Look in the mirror 
 It seems you're drinking miniature 
 And soon enough, you're gone 
 Woops, sorry 'bout that 
 It's just an accident 
 Revenge nobody forgets 
 Chop it into bits 
 The bitterness is hard to hide 
 It smells like homicide 
 Just nod and say it's okay 
 No one saw the perfect crime 
 I can't wait for the next time 
 The bitterness is hard to hide 
 It smells like homicide 
 Just nod and say it's okay 
 You try to make the moment 
 Last you sold it right in half 
 You die and have a nice day 
 Woops, sorry 'bout that 
 It's just an accident 
 Revenge nobody forgets 
 Chop it into bits 
 The bitterness is hard to hide 
 It smells like homicide 
 Just nod and say it's okay 
 Woops, sorry 'bout that 
 It's just an accident 
 You try to make the moment 
 Last you sold it right in half 
 You die and have a nice day 
 Woops, sorry 'bout that

93,Faith No More,rock,Sweet Emotion,"Your shirt is stained when you wear your heart on your sleeve 
 So you wash it off and pretend that it was never there 
 Your face in the mirror doesn't give a reflection 
 So you paint one on, it's the art of imitation 
 It tickles you to death, knowing you can play the game so well 
 But you can't ignore, don't know who you are, so what 
 Your sugar coated, guns are loaded 
 Afraid of tasting yourself 
 So you keep lying, never trying 
 Say your somebody else 
 The bitterness inside your heart 
 It shows through in your eyes 
 And you can't win in the end, huh 
 You take your big guns, loading them with your fatal charm 
 The fact is you love me, nothing can kill me now 
 I've learned the power of deceit, the power of the sweet, is so true 
 Now I'm a confection, to taste good is all I must do 
 Your sugar coated, guns are loaded 
 Afraid of tasting yourself 
 So you keep lying, never trying 
 Say your somebody else 
 Its too easy to get to where you take it, dig it, every day 
 And you can't win in the end 
 The bitterness inside your heart, it shows through in your eyes 
 And you can't win in the end 
 The bitterness inside your heart, it shows through in your eyes 
 And you can't win in the end, huh 
 Your sugar coated, guns are loaded 
 Afraid of tasting yourself 
 So you keep lying, never trying 
 Say your somebody else 
 The bitterness inside your heart, it shows through in your eyes 
 And you can't win in the end, huh"
94,Faith No More,rock,Am I Evil?,"(Originally recorded by Diamond Head) 
 My mother was a witch, she was burned alive 
 Thankless little bitch, for the tears I cried 
 Take her down now, don't want to see her face 
 All blistered and burnt, can't hide my disgrace 
 Twenty-seven, everyone was nice 
 Gotta see 'em make 'em pay the price 
 See their bodies out on the ice 
 Take my time 
 Am I evil? Yes, I am 
 Am I evil? I am man, yes, I am 
 As I watched my mother die, I lost my head 
 Revenge now I sought, to break with my bread 
 Taking no chances, you come with me 
 I'll split you to the bone, help set you free 
 Twenty-seven, everyone was nice 
 Gotta see 'em, make 'em pay the price 
 See their bodies out on the ice 
 Take my time 
 Am I evil? Yes, I am 
 Am I evil? I am man, yes, I am, ooh 
 On with the action now, I'll strip your pride 
 I'll spread your blood around, I'll see you ride 
 Your face is scarred with steel, wounds deep and neat 
 Like a double dozen before ya, smells so sweet 
 Am I evil? Yes, I am 
 Am I evil? I am man 
 I'll make my residence, I'll watch your fire 
 You can come with me, sweet desire 
 My face is long forgot, my face not my own 
 Sweet and timely whore, take me home 
 Am I evil? Yes, I am 
 Am I evil? I am man 
 My soul is longing for, await my heir 
 Sent to avenge my mother, sweep myself 
 My face is long forgot, my face not my own 
 Sweet and timely whore, take me home 
 Am I evil? Yes, I am 
 Am I evil? I am man 
 Am I evil? Yes, I fucking am 
 Am I evil? I am man"
95,Faith No More,rock,Glory Box,"Glory Box 
 I'm so tired of playing, 
 Playing with this bow and arrow, 
 Gonna give my heart away, 
 Leave it to the other girls to play. 
 For I've been a tempteress too long, 
 Oh yeah, 
 Give me a reason to love you, 
 Give me a reason to be a women, 
 I just want to be a woman 
 From this time unchained, 
 Were all looking at a different picture, 
 Through this new frame of mind, 
 A thousand flowers could bloom, 
 Move over and give us some room 
 So don't you stop being a man, 
 Just take a little look from outside when you can, 
 Sow a little a tenderness, 
 No matter if you cry 
 {It's all I want to be, a woman}, 
 So I just want to be a woman, 
 For this is the beginning of forever and ever, 
 Its time to move over now, 
 {So I want to be} 
 Back to start again and fades"
96,Faith No More,rock,Greenfields,"Once there were greenfields 
 Kissed by the sun 
 Once there were valleys 
 Where rivers used to run 
 Once there were blue skies 
 With white clouds high above 
 Once they were part of 
 An everlasting love 
 We were the lovers who strolled 
 Through greenfields 
 Greenfields are gone now 
 Parched by the sun 
 Gone from the valleys 
 Where rivers used to run 
 Gone with the cold wind 
 That swept in through to my heart 
 Gone with the lovers 
 Who let their dreams depart 
 Where are the greenfields 
 Where we used to go 
 I'll never know what made you run away 
 How can I keep searching when dark clouds hide the day? 
 I only know there's nothing here for me 
 Nothing in this wild world left for me to see 
 But I'll keep on waiting 
 Till you return 
 I'll keep on waiting 
 Until the day you learn 
 You can't be happy 
 When your heart's on the road 
 You can't be happy 
 Until you bring it home 
 Home to the greenfields 
 And me once again"
97,Faith No More,rock,The Crow That Wheeps,"I jerk every night, after midnight, 
 It takes quite a while but I cum. 
 Its great when your jerking around like that 
 So lets all jerk off tonight! 
 Now maim and destroy, 
 Every girl every boy, 
 Decamate, violate, desecrate, 
 Exterminate, obliviate, demolish... kill! 
 I have big hairy nut sacks, 
 Floating in the sea of spring x3 
 I watch my left nut, 
 Bigger then the right, 
 Saggin low, 
 Jerking slow. 
 Now I speak to walls of woe, 
 Ask them now, maybe they know, 
 What was asked the day before, 
 When we started this romance, 
 You looked at me, and I at you and you said: 
 You guys make me dance! 
 So suck my juice, right out of my ass, 
 Lick the inside clean, 
 Let me eat shit fried with vinigerate sauce, 
 And let me sleeze your spleen. 
 Gui has a small one!"
