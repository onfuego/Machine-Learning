0,Queen,rock,Keep Yourself Alive,"Take off 
 I was told a million times of all the troubles in my way 
 ""Mind you grow a little wiser, little better every day"" 
 But if I crossed a million rivers and I rode a million miles 
 Then I'd still be where I started, bread and butter for a smile 
 Well, I sold a million mirrors in a shop in an alleyway 
 But I never saw my face in any window any day 
 Now they say your folks are telling you ""Be a superstar"" 
 But I tell you just be satisfied, stay right where you are 
 Keep yourself alive, yeah 
 Keep yourself alive 
 It'll take you all your time and money 
 Honey, you'll survive 
 Well, I've loved a million women in a belladonnic haze 
 And I ate a million dinners brought to me on silver trays 
 Give me everything I need to feed my body and my soul 
 And I'll grow a little bigger, maybe that can be my goal 
 I was told a million times of all the people in my way 
 How I had to keep on trying and get better every day 
 But if I crossed a million rivers and I rode a million miles 
 Then I'd still be where I started, same as when I started 
 Keep yourself alive, come on 
 Keep yourself alive 
 It'll take you all your time and money 
 Honey, you'll survive, shake 
 Keep yourself alive, wow 
 Keep yourself alive 
 It'll take you all your time and money 
 To keep me satisfied 
 Do you think you're better every day 
 No, I just think I'm two steps nearer to my grave 
 Keep yourself alive, come on 
 Keep yourself alive 
 You take your time and take my money 
 Keep yourself alive 
 Keep yourself alive, come on 
 Keep yourself alive 
 All you people 
 Keep yourself alive 
 Keep yourself alive, come on, come on 
 Keep yourself alive 
 It'll take you all your time and a money 
 To keep me satisfied 
 Keep yourself alive

1,Queen,rock,Doing All Right,"Yesterday my life was in ruin 
 Now today I know what I'm doing 
 Got a feeling I should be doing all right 
 Doing all right 
 Where will I be this time tomorrow? 
 Jumped in joy or sinking in sorrow 
 Anyway I should be doing all right 
 Doing all right 
 Should be waiting for the sun 
 Looking round to find the words to say 
 Should be waiting for the skies to clear 
 There ain't time in all the world 
 Should be waiting for the sun 
 And anyway I've got to hide away 
 Yesterday my life was in ruin 
 Now today God knows what I'm doing 
 Anyway I should be doing all right 
 Doing all right

 Put out the good and keep the bad 
 Don't believe all you read in the Bible 
 You sinners get in line 
 Saints you leave far behind 
 Very soon you're gonna be his disciple 
 Don't listen to what mama says 
 Not a word not a word mama says 
 Or else you'll find yourself being the rival 
 The great Lord before He died 
 Knelt sinners by his side 
 And said, ""you're gonna realise tomorrow"" 
 No I'm not gonna tell you 
 What you already know 
 'Cause time and time again 
 The old man said it all a long time ago 
 Come come on the time is right 
 This evil man will fight 
 I told you once before 
 Wouldn't you like to know? 
 Wouldn't you like to know? 
 Just like I said before 
 Great King Rat was a dirty old man

3,Queen,rock,My Fairy King,"In the land where horses born with eagle wings 
 And honey bees have lost their stings 
 There's singing forever 
 Lions den with fallow deer 
 And rivers made from wine so clear 
 Flow on and on forever 
 Dragons fly like sparrows through the air 
 And baby lambs where Samson dares 
 To go on on on on on on 
 My fairy king can see things 
 He rules the air and turns the tides 
 That are not there for you and me 
 Ooh yeah he guides the winds 
 My fairy king can do right and nothing wrong 
 Then came man to savage in the night 
 To run like thieves and to kill like knives 
 To take away the power from the magic hand 
 To bring about the ruin to the promised land 
 They turn the milk into sour 
 Like the blue in the blood of my veins 
 Why can't you see it 
 Fire burnin' in hell with the cry of screaming pain 
 Son of heaven set me free and let me go 
 Sea turn dry no salt from sand 
 Seasons fly no helping hand 
 Teeth don't shine like pearls for the poor man's eyes 
 Someone someone has drained the colour from my wings 
 Broken my fairy circle ring 
 And shamed the king in all his pride 
 Changed the winds and wronged the tides 
 Mother Mercury Mercury 
 Look what they've done to me 
 I cannot run I cannot hide"

 And I get afraid of losing my way 
 Oh oh the night comes down 
 Ooh and it's dark again 
 Once I could laugh with ev'ryone 
 Once I could see the good in me 
 The black and the white distinctively colouring 
 Holding the world inside 
 Now all the world is grey to me 
 Nobody can see you gotta believe it

 To buckle down and to shovel shit 
 What'll you do for loving 
 When it's only just begun? 
 I want you to be a woman 
 Tried to be a teacher and a fisher of men 
 An equal people preacher 
 Will you lead us all the same? 
 Well I travelled all round the world 
 A brand new word for day 
 Watching the time mustn't linger behind 
 Pardon me I have to get away 
 What'll you think of heaven 
 If it's back from where you came? 
 I want you to be a woman

 The beggars shouted the lepers called Him 
 The old man said nothing 
 He just stared about him 
 All going down to see the Lord Jesus 
 All going down to see the Lord Jesus 
 All going down 
 Then came a man before His feet he fell 
 Unclean said the leper and rang his bell 
 Felt the palm of a hand touch his head 
 Go now go now you're a new man instead 
 All going down to see the Lord Jesus 
 All going down to see the Lord Jesus 
 All going down 
 It all began with the three wise men 
 Followed a star took them to Bethlehem 
 And made it heard throughout the land 
 Born was a leader of man 
 All going down to see the Lord Jesus 
 All going down to see the Lord Jesus 
 All going down

 Followed a star took them to Bethlehem

 And all the creatures great and small 
 Let me take you to the river without a ford 
 Oh and then one day you realise 
 You're all the same within his eyes

 From father to son 
 Hear the word that I say 
 I fought with you 
 Fought on your side 
 Long before you were born 
 Joyful the sound 
 The word goes around 
 From father to son to son 
 And the voice is so clear 
 Time after time it keeps 
 Calling you, calling you on 
 Don't destroy what you see 
 Your country to be 
 Just keep building on the ground that's been won 
 Kings will be crowned 
 The word goes around 
 From father to son to son 
 Won't you hear us sing 
 Our family song? 
 Now we hand it on 
 But I've heard it all before 
 Take this letter that I give you 
 Take it sonny, hold it high 
 You won't understand a word that's in it 
 But you'll write it all again before you die 
 A word in your ear 
 From father to son 
 Funny you don't hear a single word that I say 
 But my letter to you 
 Will stay by your side through the years 
 Till the loneliness is gone 
 Sing if you will 
 But the air you breathe 
 I live to give you 
 Father to son father to son 
 Father to son father to son 
 Joyful the sound 
 Word goes around 
 Father to son to son 
 Kings will be crowned 
 Earth goes around 
 Father to son to son 
 Joyful the sound 
 Word goes around 
 Father to son to son 
 Kings will be crowned 
 Earth goes around

11,Queen,rock,White Queen (As It Began),"So sad her eyes 
 Smiling dark eyes 
 So sad her eyes 
 As it began 
 On such a breathless night as this 
 Upon my brow the lightest kiss 
 I walked alone 
 And all around the air did say 
 My lady soon will stir this way 
 In sorrow known 
 The white queen walks 
 And the night grows pale 
 Stars of lovingness in her hair 
 Heeding unheard 
 Pleading one word 
 So sad her eyes 
 She cannot see 
 How did thee fare what have thee seen 
 The mother of the willow green 
 I call her name 
 And 'neath her window have I stayed 
 I loved the footsteps that she made 
 And when she came 
 White queen how my heart did ache 
 And dry my lips no words could make 
 So still I wait 
 My goddess hear my darkest fear 
 I speak too late 
 It's forevermore that I wait 
 Dear friend goodbye 
 No tears in my eyes 
 So sad it ends as it began"
12,Queen,rock,Some Day One Day,"You never heard my song before 
 The music was too loud 
 But now I think you hear me well 
 For now we both know how 
 No star can light our way 
 In this cloud of dark and fear 
 But some day, one day... 
 Funny how the pages turn 
 And hold us in between 
 A misty castle waits for you 
 And you shall be a queen 
 Today the cloud it hangs 
 Over us and all is grey 
 But some day, one day... 
 When I was you and you were me 
 And we were very young 
 Together took us nearly there 
 The rest may not be sung 
 So still the cloud it hangs 
 Over us and we're alone 
 But some day, one day... 
 We'll come home"

 Misuse her and you'll lose her as a friend 
 She's ma on whom you can always depend ooh 
 So listen mothers ev'rywhere 
 To just one mothers son 
 You'll get forgotten on the way 
 If you don't let them have their fun 
 Forget regrets and just remember 
 It's not so long since you were young

 From the two way mirror mountain 
 They're running up behind 
 And they're coming all about 
 Can't go east 'cause you gotta go south

 Blue powder monkeys praying in the dead of night

 Take this take that bring them down to size 
 March to the Black Queen

 Little nigger sugar then a rub-a-dub-a-baby oil 
 Black on black on every finger nail and toe 
 We've only begun begun 
 Make this make that keep making all that noise 
 Ooh march to the Black Queen 
 Now I've got a belly full 
 You can be my sugar baby 
 You can be my honey chile 
 A voice from behind me reminds me 
 Spread out your wings you are an angel 
 Remember to deliver with the speed of light 
 A little bit of love and joy 
 Everything you do bears a will 
 And a why and a wherefore 
 A little bit of love and joy 
 In each and every soul lies a man 
 And very soon he'll deceive and discover 
 But even to the end of his life 
 He'll bring a little love 
 Ah ah ah... 
 I reign with my left hand I rule with my right 
 I'm lord of all darkness I'm queen of the night 
 I've got the power 
 Now do the march of the Black Queen 
 My life is in your hands I'll fo and I'll fie 
 I'll be what you make me I'll do what you like 
 I'll be a bad boy I'll be your bad boy 
 I'll do the march of the Black Queen 
 Ah ah ah... 
 Walking true to style she's vulgar abuse and vile 
 Fi fo The Black Queen tattoos all her pies 
 She boils and she bakes 
 And she never dots her I's 
 La la la... 
 So forget your sing a-longs and your lullabies 
 Surrender to the singing of the fireflies 
 Dance to the devil in beat with the band 
 To hell with all of you hand in hand 
 But now it's time to be gone 
 La la la la forever forever

 Met his little Jenny on a public holiday 
 A happy pair they made, so decorously laid 
 'Neath the gay illuminations all along the promenade 
 ""It's so good to know there's still a little magic in the air 
 I'll weave my spell"" 
 ""Jenny will you stay - tarry with me pray 
 Nothing 'ere need come between us tell me love, what do you say ?"" 
 ""Oh no I must away to my mum in disarray 
 If my mother should discover how I spent my holiday

 The Volunteers came home that day 
 And they bring good news of a world so newly born 
 Though their hearts so heavily weigh 
 For the earth is old and grey, little darlin' we'll away

 For so many years have gone though I'm older but a year

 Spreading his hands on the multitude there 
 A man who cried for a love gone stale 
 And ice cold hearts of charity bare 
 I watched as fear took the old men's gaze 
 Hopes of the young in troubled graves 
 I see no day, I heard him say 
 ""So gray is the face of every mortal""

 Summoned by your own hand""

 Return like the white dove

 Taking the lost and the unloved babe 
 Late, too late, all the wretches run 
 These kings of beasts now counting their days 
 From mother's love is the son estranged 
 Married his own, his precious gain 
 The earth will shake, in two will break 
 And death all around will be your dowry

 The work devoured my waking hours, but when my time was through 
 Reward of all my efforts my own limited company 
 I hardly noticed Sally as we parted company 
 All through the years in the end it appears 
 There was never really anyone but me 
 Now I'm old I puff my pipe

 Look into my eyes and you'll see 
 I'm the only one 
 You've captured my love 
 Stolen my heart 
 Changed my life 
 Everytime you make a move 
 You destroy my mind 
 And the way you touch 
 I lose control and shiver 
 Deep inside 
 You take my breath away 
 You can reduce me to tears 
 With a single sigh (Please don't cry anymore) 
 Every breath that you take 
 Any sound that you make 
 Is a whisper in my ear 
 I could give up all my life 
 For just one kiss 
 I would surely die 
 If you dismiss me from your love 
 You take my breath away 
 So please don't go 
 Don't leave me here all by myself 
 I get ever so lonely from time to time 
 I will find you 
 Anywhere you go 
 I'll be right behind you 
 Right until the ends of the earth 
 I'll get no sleep till I find you 
 To tell you 
 That you just 
 Take my breath away 
 I will find you 
 Anywhere you go 
 Right until the ends of the earth 
 I'll get no sleep till I find you 
 To tell you 
 When I've found you 
 I love you"

 I would not care to say 
 For every star in heaven 
 There's a sad soul here today 
 Wake up in the morning with a good face 
 Stare at the moon all day 
 Lonely as a whisper on a star chase 
 Does anyone care anyway? 
 For all the prayers in heaven 
 So much of life's this way 
 Did we leave our way behind us? 
 Such a long long way behind us? 
 Who knows when, now who knows where 
 Where the light of day will find us? 
 Look for the day 
 Take heart, my friend, we love you 
 Though it seems like you're alone 
 A million lights above you 
 Smile down upon your home 
 Oh, hurry put your troubles in a suitcase 
 Come let the new child play 
 Lonely as a whisper on a star chase 
 I'm leaving here, I'm long away 
 For all the stars in heaven 
 I would not live 
 I could not live this way 
 Did we leave our way behind us? 
 Such a long long way behind us? 
 Leave it for some hopeless lane 
 Such a long long way 
 Such a long long way 
 Such a long long way 
 Such a long long away 
 I'm looking for 
 Still looking for that day"

 Driving back in style in my saloon will do quite nicely

54,Queen,rock,Drowse,"It's the sad-eyed, goodbye yesterday moments I remember 
 It's the bleak street, weak-kneed partings I recall 
 It's the mistier mist 
 The hazier days 
 The brighter sun 
 And the easier lays 
 And there's all the more reason for laughing and crying 
 When you're younger and life isn't too hard at all 
 It's the fantastic drowse of the afternoon Sundays 
 That bored you to rages of tears 
 It's the unending pleadings to waste all your good times 
 In thoughts of your middle-aged years 
 It's a vertical hold, all the things that you're told 
 For the everyday hero it all turns to zero 
 And there's all the more reason for living or dying 
 When you're young and your troubles are all very small 
 Out here on the street 
 We'd gather and meet 
 And scuff up the sidewalk with endlessly restless feet 
 And half of the time 
 We'd broaden our minds 
 More in the poolhall than we did in the schoolhall 
 With the downtown chewing gum bums 
 Watching the night life, the lights and the fun 
 Never wanted to be the boy next door 
 Always thought I'd be something more 
 But it ain't easy for a small town boy 
 It ain't easy at all 
 Thinking it right, doing it wrong 
 It's easier from an armchair 
 Waves of alternatives wash at my sleepiness 
 Have my eggs poached for breakfast, I guess 
 (I think I'll be Clint Eastwood) 
 (Jimi Hendrix, he was good) 
 (Let's try William the Conqueror) 
 (Now, who else do I like?)"

 It's just as though I hold the flower that touches you

 The blossom knows 
 There's no one else could warm my heart as much as you...

 My trumpet was my only toy 
 I've been blowin' my horn 
 Since I knew I was born 
 But there ain't nobody wants to know 
 I've been sleepin' on the sidewalk 
 Rollin' down the road 
 I may get hungry 
 But I sure don't want to go home 
 So round the corner comes a limousine 
 And the biggest grin I ever seen 
 Here sonny won't you sign 
 Right along the dotted line 
 What you sayin' are you playin' 
 Sure you don't mean me? 
 I've been sleepin' on the sidewalk 
 Rollin' down the road 
 I may get hungry 
 But I sure don't want to go home 
 (Now I tell you what happened...) 
 They took me to a room without a table 
 They said 'blow your trumpet into here' 
 I played around as well as I was able 
 And soon we had the record of the year 
 I was a legend all through the land 
 I was blowin' to a million fans 
 Nothin' was a missin' 
 All the people want to listen 
 You'd have thought I was a happy man 
 And I was sleepin' like a princess 
 Never touch the road 
 I don't get hungry 
 And I sure don't want to go home 
 (Have to have some fun...) 
 Now they tell me that I ain't so fashionable 
 An' I owe the man a million bucks a year 
 So I told 'em where to stick the fancy label 
 It's just me and the road from here 
 I'm back to playin' and layin'

 You walked all over me 
 But don't you ever give in 
 Taking one step forward slipping two steps back 
 There's an empty feeling that you can't forget 
 Reaching out for a helping hand 
 When I met you you were always charming 
 Couldn't sleep at night till you were mine 
 You were oh so so sophisticated 
 Never interested in what I'd say 
 I had to swallow my pride 
 So naive you took me for a ride 
 But now I'm the one to decide 
 Who needs well I don't need who needs you?"
65,Queen,rock,It's Late,"You say you love me 
 And I hardly know your name 
 And if I say I love you in the candlelight 
 There's no one but myself to blame 
 But there's something inside 
 That's turning my mind away 
 Oh how I could love you 
 If I could let you stay 
 It's late - but I'm bleeding deep inside 
 It's late - is it just my sickly pride? 
 Too late - even now the feeling seems to steal away 
 So late - though I'm crying I can't help but hear you say 
 It's late it's late it's late 
 But not too late 
 The way you love me 
 Is the sweetest love around 
 But after all this time 
 The more I'm trying 
 The more I seem to let you down 
 Now you tell me you're leaving 
 And I just can't believe it's true 
 Oh you know that I can love you 
 Though I know I can't be true 
 Oh you made me love you 
 Don't tell me that we're through 
 It's late - but it's driving me so mad 
 It's late - yes I know but don't try to tell me that it's 
 Too late - save our love you can't turn out the lights 
 So late - I've been wrong but I'll learn to be right 
 It's late it's late it's late 
 But not too late 
 I've been so long 
 You've been so long 
 We've been so long tryin' to work it out 
 I ain't got long 
 You ain't got long 
 We gotta know what this life is all about 
 Too late much too late 
 You're staring at me 
 With suspicion in your eye 
 You say what game are you playing? 
 What's this that you're saying? 
 I know that I can't reply 
 If I take you tonight 
 Is it making my life a lie? 
 Oh you make me wonder 
 Did I live my life alright? 
 It's late - but it's time to set me free 
 It's late - yes I know but there's no way it has to be 
 Too late - so let the fire take our bodies this night 
 So late - so let the waters take our guilt in the tide 
 It's late it's late it's late it's late 
 It's late it's late 
 It's all too late"
66,Queen,rock,My Melancholy Blues,"Another party's over 
 And I'm left cold sober 
 My baby left me for somebody new 
 I don't wanna talk about it 
 Want to forget about it 
 Wanna be intoxicated with that special brew 
 So come and get me 
 Let me 
 Get in that sinking feeling 
 That says my heart is on an all time low 
 So, don't expect me 
 To behave perfectly 
 And wear that sunny smile 
 My guess is I'm in for a cloudy and overcast 
 Don't try and stop me 
 'Cause I'm heading for that stormy weather soon 
 I'm causin' a mild sensation 
 With this new occupation 
 I'm permanently glued 
 To this extraordinary mood so now move over 
 And let me take over 
 With my melancholy blues 
 I'm causin' a mild sensation 
 With this new occupation 
 I'm in the news 
 I'm just getting used to my new exposure 
 Come into my enclosure 
 And meet my, melancholy blues"

 With matters of the heart? 
 Life is much too short 
 To while away with tears 
 If only you could see 
 Just what you do to me 
 Oh jealousy you tripped me up 
 Jealousy you brought me down 
 You bring me sorrow you cause me pain 
 Jealousy when will you let go? 
 Gotta hold of my possessive mind 
 Turned me into a jealous guy 
 How how how all my jealousy

 Freedom for just one week 
 Feels good to get away ooh 
 Tuesday I saw her down on the beach 
 I stood and watched a while 
 And she looked and smiled at me 
 Wednesday I didn't see her 
 I hoped that she'd be back tomorrow 
 And then on Thursday 
 My luck had changed 
 She stood there all alone 
 I went and asked her name 
 I never thought that this could happen to me 
 In only seven days 
 It would take a hundred or more 
 For memories to fade 
 I wish Friday would last for ever 
 I held her close to me 
 I couldn't bear to leave her there 
 Saturday just twenty four hours 
 Oh no I'm going back home on Sunday 
 Ooh so sad alone"

 You make my life worthwhile with the slightest smile 
 Or destroy me with a barely perceptible whisper 
 Gently take me remember I'll be dreamin' of my baby

 And bring him to the ground 
 You can beat him, you can cheat him, you can treat him bad

 I'm standing on my own two feet 
 Out of the doorway, the bullets rip 
 Repeating to the sound of the beat

 I'll eat my heart out 'cause I love her 
 Love her love her love her

 This street honey is a mean street 
 Living in this street honey needs a mean streak 
 We've got criminals living in this street 
 But there's a heart beat pulse 
 That keeps on pumping 
 Like a juke box playing the same dead record 
 Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring 
 I got a feeling this world is using me 
 This town honey is a dead town 
 Living in this town honey is a let down 
 Coming to this town honey is a show down 
 But there's a heart beat pulse 
 That keeps on pumping some sunshine ray 
 Through a crack in the shutter 
 Or a sight of a light at the end of a tunnel 
 Still there's a feeling this world is using me 
 Action this day action this night 
 Oh we've gotta learn to love to live 
 You can't say it ain't right

 Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring

 They called him a hero 
 In the land of the free 
 But he wouldn't shake my hand boy 
 He disappointed me 
 So I got my hand gun 
 And I blew him away 
 That critter was a bad guy 
 And I had to make him pay 
 You might fear for my reason 
 I don't care what they say 
 Look out baby it's the season 
 For the mad masquerade 
 Put out the fire put out the fire put out the fire 
 Oh you need a bullet like a hole in the head 
 Put out the fire put out the fire put out the fire 
 Don't believe what your grand-daddy said 
 She was my lover 
 It was a shame that she died 
 But the constitution's right on my side 
 'Cause I caught my lover in the neighbours bed 
 I got retribution 
 Filled 'em all full of lead 
 I've been told it's the fashion 
 To let me on the streets again 
 It's nothing but a crime of passion 
 And I'm not to blame 
 Put out the fire put out the fire put out the fire 
 You need a weapon like a hole in the head 
 Put out the fire put out the fire baby put out the fire 
 And let your sons and daughters sleep sound in their beds 
 You know a gun never killed nobody 
 You can ask anyone 
 People get shot by people 
 People with guns 
 Put out the fire put out the fire put out the fire 
 You need a gun like a hole in the head

 Don't hold me now 
 Don't break the spell darling 
 Now you are near 
 Look in my eyes and speak to me 
 The special promises I long to hear 
 Las palabras de amor 
 Let me hear the words of love 
 Despacito mi amor 
 Love me slow and gently 
 One foolish world so many souls 
 Senselessly hurled through 
 The never ending cold 
 And all for fear and all for greed 
 Speak any tongue 
 But for God's sake we need 
 Las palabras de amor 
 Let me hear the words of love 
 Despacito mi amor 
 Let me know this night and evermore 
 This room is bare 
 This night is cold 
 We're far apart and I'm growing old 
 But while we live 
 We'll meet again 
 So then my love 
 We may whisper once more 
 It's you I adore 
 Las palabras de amor 
 Let me hear the words of love 
 Despacito mi amor 
 Touch me now 
 Las palabras de amor 
 Let us share the words of love

 Can't we give ourselves one more chance? 
 Why can't we give love that one more chance? 
 Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love 
 Give love, give love, give love, give love? 
 'Cause love's such an old fashioned 
 Word and love dares you to care for 
 The people on the edge (People on streets) of the night

 Caring about ourselves

 It can happen to anyone 
 You win - you lose 
 It's a chance you have to take with love 
 Oh yeah - I fell in love 
 And now you say it's over and I'm falling apart 
 It's a hard life 
 To be true lovers together 
 To love and live forever in each others hearts 
 It's a long hard fight 
 To learn to care for each other 
 To trust in one another right from the start 
 When you're in love 
 I try and mend the broken pieces 
 I try to fight back the tears 
 They say it's just a state of mind 
 But it happens to everyone 
 How it hurts - deep inside 
 When your love has cut you down to size 
 Life is tough - on your own 
 Now I'm waiting for something to fall from the skies 
 And I'm waiting for love 
 Yes it's a hard life 
 Two lovers together 
 To love and live forever in each others hearts 
 It's a long hard fight 
 To learn to care for each other 
 To trust in one another - right from the start 
 When you're in love 
 Yes it's a hard life 
 In a world that's filled with sorrow 
 There are people searching for love in ev'ry way

 This is the only life for me 
 Surround myself around my own fantasy 
 You just gotta be strong and believe in yourself 
 Forget all the sadness 'cause love is all you need 
 Love is all you need 
 Do you know what it's like to be alone in this world 
 When you're down and out on your luck and you're a failure? 
 Wake up screaming in the middle of the night 
 You think it's all been a waste of time 
 It's been a bad year 
 You start believing ev'rything's gonna be alright 
 Next minute you're down and you're flat on your back 
 A brand new day is beginning 
 Get that sunny feeling and you're on your way 
 Just believe - just keep passing the open windows 
 Just believe - just keep passing the open windows 
 Do you know how it feels when you don't have a friend 
 Without a job and no money to spend? 
 You're a stranger 
 All you think about is suicide 
 One of these days you're gonna lose the fight 
 You'd better keep out of danger - yeah! 
 That same old feeling just keeps burning deep inside 
 Keep telling yourself it's gonna be the end 
 Oh get yourself together 
 Things are looking better everyday 
 Just believe - just keep passing the open windows 
 Just believe - just keep passing the open windows 
 This is the only life for me 
 Surround myself around my own fantasy

 Forget all the sadness 'cause love is all you need

 It comes to you as to us all 
 We're just waiting 
 For the hammer to fall 
 Oh ev'ry night and every day 
 A little piece of you is falling away 
 But lift your face the Western Way 
 Build your muscles as your body decays 
 Toe your line and play their game 
 Let the anaesthetic cover it all 
 Till one day they call your name 
 You know it's time for the hammer to fall 
 Rich or poor or famous 
 For your truth it's all the same (oh no, oh no) 
 Lock your door the rain is pouring 
 Through your window pane (oh no) 
 Baby now your struggle's all in vain, hey, hey 
 For we who grew up tall and proud 
 In the shadow of the mushroom cloud 
 Convinced our voices can't be heard 
 We just wanna scream it louder and louder and louder 
 What the hell we fighting for? 
 Just surrender and it won't hurt at all 
 Just got time to say your prayers 
 While you're waiting for the hammer to hammer to fall 
 It's gonna fall

 Take a look at all the suffering we breed 
 So many lonely faces scattered all around 
 Searching for what they need 
 Is this the world we created? 
 What did we do it for? 
 Is this the world we invaded 
 Against the law? 
 So it seems in the end 
 Is this what we're all living for today? 
 The world that we created 
 You know that every day a helpless child is born 
 Who needs some loving care inside a happy home 
 Somewhere a wealthy man is sitting on his throne 
 Waiting for life to go by 
 Oh, is this the world we created? 
 We made it on our own 
 Is this the world we devastated 
 Right to the bone? 
 If there's a God in the sky looking down 
 What can he think of what we've done 
 To the world that He created?"

 I didn't wanna cry 'cause I had to be cool 
 I didn't wanna tell you that you're much too cruel 
 Did you have to run off with that doggone fool... 
 All I gotta do is think about you 
 Every night and day I go crazy 
 All I gotta do is get my hands on you 
 You better stay away from me baby... 
 I wouldn't mind the postman - if the neighbours didn't know 
 Or the gas man, electric man, man to fix the car 
 I'd have to let it go 
 But you had to bring me down for a rock'n'roll clone 
 Leave me like a sucker standing all alone 
 Did you have to run off with that rolling stone? 
 Go ahead fool 
 All I gotta do is think about you 
 Every night and day I go crazy 
 All I gotta do is get my hands on you 
 You better stay away from me baby. 
 So I ain't gonna go and see the Rolling Stones no more 
 I don't wanna go and see Queen no more no more 
 I ain't gonna go and see the Rolling Stones no more 
 I don't wanna go and see Queen no more no more 
 Now I don't wanna hurt you - like you been a-hurting me 
 But you know I'll be watchin' 
 Rolling on the floor next time you're on TV 
 Had enough of your pretending that you know where it's at 
 Coming on to all the boys like a real spoilt brat 
 To think I nearly let you get away with all that 
 No way man 
 All I gotta do is think about you 
 Every night and day I go crazy 
 All I gotta do is get my hands on you

 Tread that fine line 
 Oh we'll keep on tryin' - yeah

 While we live according to race, colour or creed 
 While we rule by blind madness and pure greed 
 Our lives dictated by tradition, superstition, false religion 
 Through the eons, and on and on 
 Oh yes we'll keep on tryin' 
 We'll tread that fine line 
 Oh oh we'll keep on tryin' 
 Till the end of time 
 Till the end of time 
 Through the sorrow all through our splendour 
 Don't take offence at my innuendo 
 You can be anything you want to be 
 Just turn yourself into anything you think that you could ever be 
 Be free with your tempo be free be free 
 Surrender your ego - be free be free to yourself 
 Ooh, ooh - 
 If there's a God or any kind of justice under the sky 
 If there's a point, if there's a reason to live or die 
 If there's an answer to the questions we feel bound to ask 
 Show yourself - destroy our fears - release your mask 
 Oh yes we'll keep on trying 
 Hey tread that fine line 
 Yeah we'll keep on smiling yeah (yeah yeah yeah) 
 And whatever will be - will be 
 We'll just keep on trying 
 We'll just keep on trying

 You can't turn back the tide, ain't that a shame? 
 Ooh, I'd like to go back one time on a rollercoaster ride 
 When life was just a game 
 No use in sitting 
 And thinking on what you did 
 When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids 
 Sometimes it seems like lately I just don't know 
 Better sit back and go with the flow 
 'Cause these are the days of our lives 
 They've flown in the swiftness of time 
 These days are all gone now 
 But some things remain 
 When I look and I find no change 
 Those were the days of our lives, yeah

 I don't need the passion too 
 I don't want a stormy affair 
 To make me feel my life is heading somewhere 
 All I want is the comfort and care 
 Just to know that my woman gives me sweet mother love 
 I've walked too long in this lonely lane 
 I've had enough of this same old game 
 I'm a man of the world and they say that I'm strong 
 But my heart is heavy, and my hope is gone 
 Out in the city, in the cold world outside 
 I don't want pity, just a safe place to hide 
 Mama please, let me back inside 
 I don't want to make no waves 
 But you can give me all the love that I crave 
 I can't take it if you see me cry 
 I long for peace before I die 
 All I want is to know that you're there 
 You're gonna give me all your sweet mother love 
 My body's aching, but I can't sleep 
 My dreams are all the company I keep 
 Got such a feeling as the sun goes down 
 I'm coming home to my sweet mother love"

 Too many bitter tears are raining down on me 
 I'm far away from home 
 And I've been facing this alone for much too long 
 I feel like no one ever told the truth to me 
 About growing up and what a struggle it would be 
 In my tangled state of mind 
 I've been looking back to find where I went wrong 
 Too much love will kill you 
 If you can't make up your mind 
 Torn between the lover 
 And the love you leave behind 
 You're headed for disaster 
 'Cause you never read the signs 
 Too much love will kill you 
 Every time 
 I'm just the shadow of the man I used to be 
 And it seems like there's no way out of this for me 
 I used to bring you sunshine 
 Now all I ever do is bring you down 
 How would it be if you were standing in my shoes 
 Can't you see that it's impossible to choose 
 No there's no making sense of it 
 Every way I go I'm bound to lose 
 Too much love will kill you 
 Just as sure as none at all 
 It'll drain the power that's in you 
 Make you plead and scream and crawl 
 And the pain will make you crazy 
 You're the victim of your crime 
 Too much love will kill you 
 Every time 
 Too much love will kill you 
 It'll make your life a lie 
 Yes, too much love will kill you 
 And you won't understand why 
 You'd give your life, you'd sell your soul 
 But here it comes again 
 Too much love will kill you

 There must be more to life than this 
 How do we cope in a world without love 
 Mending all those broken hearts and tending to those crying faces 
 There must be more to life than living 
 There must be more than meets the eye 
 Why should it be just a case of black or white 
 There must be more to life than this 
 Why is this world so full of hate 
 People dying everywhere 
 And we destroy what we create 
 People fighting for their human rights 
 But we just go on saying c'est la vie 
 So this is life 
 There must be more to life than killing 
 A better way for us to survive 
 What good is life, if in the end we all must die 
 There must be more to life than this 
 There must be more to life than this 
 There must be more to life than this 
 I live and hope for a world filled with love 
 Then we can all just live in peace 
 There must be more to life, much more to life, 
 There must be more to life, more to life than this"
